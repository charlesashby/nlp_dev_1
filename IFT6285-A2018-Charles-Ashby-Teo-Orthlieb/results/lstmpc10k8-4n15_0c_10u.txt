It is important for me to take advantage of the 10th anniversary of this key event in European integration to pay homage , in my turn , to those men who created the <unk w="problem"/> , such as Pierre Werner , Helmut Kohl , François Mitterrand , Jacques <unk w="delors"/> , Valéry Giscard d 'Estaing and others .

I would like , <unk w="once"/> again , to applaud their vision , <unk w="their"/> determination and their unfailing commitment to Europe .

Those I have mentioned , and <unk w="the"/> others who accompanied them , could not have imagined the rapid success of their political project .

Since 1 January of this year , 16 Member States have been <unk w="involved"/> in the Economic and Monetary Union and the euro is the currency of <unk w="the"/> 330 million European citizens .

The <unk w="commission"/> , then , has become the <unk w="only"/> tangible sign of European integration .

As a tangible sign <unk w="of"/> around the world , the euro is a measure of stability .

It is protecting its citizens from <unk w="the"/> most serious consequences of <unk w="the"/> economic crisis .

After 10 years , <unk w="it"/> has to be recognised that <unk w="the"/> euro is an unquestionable success .

Now , <unk w="we"/> only have value if they are bridges to the future , as we have to recognise that , despite our collective indulgence as we <unk w=","/> ourselves , <unk w="the"/> true tests for the <unk w="quality"/> and coherence of the euro area <unk w="before"/> us .

<unk w="last"/> year , 2009 , will be an extremely difficult year for the <unk w="free-trade"/> area economies and for European citizens and there will be many challenges facing us , both internally and externally .

Internally , euro <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> governments will have to <unk w="work"/> together to contain the effects of the <unk w="bse"/> crisis and invest in the structural bases of the economy to build a bridge to the post-crisis <unk w="economy"/> .

We must not lose sight of the fact that the euro , this protective screen we have built around our economies , did not just fall <unk w="within"/> our laps .

The euro area economies are <unk w="being"/> protected against negative economic developments because being part of <unk w="the"/> euro area is a mark <unk w="of"/> quality <unk w="and"/> that its members <unk w="have"/> a real capacity for implementing prudent macroeconomic policies and policies based on sustained growth and <unk w="employment"/> for <unk w="european"/> citizens .

The protection afforded by the euro is therefore directly linked to our <unk w="opinion"/> , which rests on the ability to implement such policies .

This <unk w="report"/> is the foundation <unk w="of"/> the benefits of Economic and Monetary Union and <unk w="we"/> must maintain it to <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> fully to profit from the <unk w="creation"/> of the single currency .

<unk w="however"/> , we have to learn <unk w="from"/> political lessons from the international financial <unk w="and"/> economic crisis .

The lack of sufficient transparency , responsibility and <unk w="transparency"/> in the financial sector therefore acted as a catalyst for the crisis .

The re-establishment <unk w="of"/> stability in <unk w="the"/> financial and the real economy <unk w="on"/> a world scale <unk w=","/> a <unk w="major"/> reform of the financial system and the elimination of the major imbalances in the mix of global consumption and global saving .

<unk w="the"/> balancing demands the active cooperation <unk w="of"/> the major economies in America , <unk w="asia"/> and Europe .

Despite noticeable progress , the euro 's international image remains , too <unk w="often"/> , overly <unk w="european"/> and national interests too often <unk w="carried"/> out over the <unk w="public"/> interest , preventing the euro area from fully assuming the political responsibility that corresponds to <unk w="the"/> economic importance <unk w="or"/> from achieving all of the economic benefits deriving from Economic and Monetary Union .

Economic and Monetary Union is , of course , an economic project , but it is , first of all , a political <unk w="solution"/> .

<unk w="as"/> a result , we <unk w="must"/> take advantage of the euro <unk w=","/> second <unk w="largest"/> to perfect the Economic and Monetary Union by strengthening its political bodies , both internally and externally .

<unk w="mr"/> President , Prime Minister , <unk w="representatives"/> of the committees , ladies and <unk w="gentlemen"/> , I am <unk w="sure"/> that I am echoing the views of the vast majority of this Chamber in saying that , 10 years after its launch , I , as a European , am proud of the success of the <unk w="report"/> .

I would like to congratulate Parliament on its initiative to commemorate the 10th anniversary of our single <unk w="part-session"/> here , in this Plenary Chamber <unk w="in"/> the European Parliament in <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> .

The <unk w="social"/> and Economic and Monetary Union have undeniably been a success .

Within the short period of a decade , the euro has <unk w="been"/> a well-deserved reputation for strength and stability .

The euro <unk w="is"/> the second of the world 's currencies <unk w="and"/> , thanks to its role in the international economy , is already comparable in some respects to the dollar as an instrument of commerce and <unk w="freedom"/> of payment in <unk w="public"/> finance .

Above <unk w="all"/> , though , the euro <unk w="is"/> part of the daily life of nearly 330 million people <unk w="from"/> 16 countries of <unk w="the"/> European Union .

We all carry in our wallets this symbol <unk w="of"/> a shared European identity : because the euro , as well as being a currency , is a central element <unk w="of"/> our European project , reminding us in a <unk w="better"/> way of the benefits of the integration process that began over half a century ago .

The euro has provided a clear boost to <unk w="sport"/> and <unk w=","/> among its <unk w="member"/> States .

The euro <unk w="has"/> also facilitated <unk w="the"/> creation <unk w="of"/> 16 million jobs over the last 10 years in the euro <unk w="area"/> , three times the corresponding figure from the previous decade .

<unk w="the"/> euro <unk w="has"/> encouraged financial integration and the development of the single market ; it has protected the members <unk w="of"/> the euro area from external disruption ; and it has been and continues to be a pole of stability , not just for the European economy , but also for the global economy .

However , those who think that the Economic and Monetary Union is not ready <unk w="to"/> face the consequences of this crisis are quite mistaken .

On the <unk w="contrary"/> , if <unk w="the"/> single currency did not exist , the adverse effects of the crisis would <unk w="be"/> much greater .

Many Member <unk w="states"/> would <unk w="then"/> be facing great <unk w="importance"/> in their exchange rates and , <unk w="hence"/> , might even <unk w="appear"/> suffering speculative attacks on their currencies .

The Stability and Growth Pact , reformed in 2005 , has encouraged governments to sort out their public accounts , leading in 2007 to the lowest budget deficit for 25 years , which is now enabling <unk w="us"/> to face the crisis in a better situation .

Throughout this crisis , the actions of the European <unk w="central"/> Bank have done nothing but reinforce the solid <unk w="effects"/> that it had already earned in the early years of Economic and Monetary Union .

By decisively adopting the necessary measures and taking the lead in cooperating with the other central banks in industrialised <unk w="countries"/> , the European Central Bank has served as our guide throughout this period and has substantially contributed to preventing <unk w="the"/> financial collapse .

The economic situation is not as we would have hoped as we celebrate this anniversary , but events are highlighting more than <unk w="just"/> the advantages of Economic and Monetary <unk w="union"/> .

For those countries which have not yet joined , the <unk w="free-trade"/> area <unk w="is"/> an increasingly attractive option , as demonstrated last week in Bratislava <unk w=","/> we welcomed Slovakia as the newest - the 16th - member <unk w="states"/> the <unk w="european"/> family .

<unk w="the"/> European Commission and <unk w="parliament"/> must continue working with Member States , the Eurogroup , the European Central Bank <unk w="and"/> the international community in order to place our <unk w="emphasis"/> on the path to the sustainable resumption of growth .

In this <unk w="respect"/> , the Commission 's recommendations in the report that we submitted a <unk w="few"/> months ago on the first <unk w="five"/> years of Economic <unk w="and"/> Monetary Union , which <unk w="was"/> recently debated in this Chamber , are as valid or even more valid today than <unk w="they"/> were last spring .

<unk w="the"/> budgetary vigilance , its extension to other macroeconomic aspects , the <unk w="coherence"/> between macroeconomic policies and <unk w="structural"/> reform , <unk w="the"/> external image of the <unk w="union"/> and improved governance of the Economic and Monetary Union are , and must continue to <unk w="be"/> , the <unk w="main"/> themes on which to base the euro 's second decade , with at least as many successes as this first one .

Mr President , I <unk w="would"/> like to conclude by paying <unk w="tribute"/> to the vision and <unk w="one"/> of the founding <unk w="fathers"/> of the <unk w="union"/> , whose <unk w="lives"/> and resolute action bequeathed to us a currency of which all Europeans <unk w="can"/> be proud .

The crisis has opened up a new chapter for the global economy , in <unk w="both"/> the Economic and Monetary Union <unk w="will"/> continue to play a <unk w="key"/> role in <unk w="developing"/> the common <unk w="position"/> and <unk w="freedom"/> of all <unk w="kinds"/> .

Mr President , Mr Juncker , Mr Trichet , ladies and gentlemen , everyone who has been involved in <unk w="adopting"/> the European currency is grateful to you , Mr President , and to you , ladies and gentlemen , for this very fine initiative which you have taken in <unk w="conjunction"/> the 10th anniversary of the birth of <unk w="the"/> euro .

I am one of those people who think that it <unk w="is"/> better to avoid the ever-increasing number of commemoration ceremonies , but this one is justified because it marks the greatest contribution to European integration since the election of the European Parliament by universal suffrage in 1979 .

We have certainly come a <unk w="long"/> way and perhaps this pleasant , friendly gathering does not paint the whole picture .

I would like <unk w="to"/> pay tribute to all <unk w="those"/> who mapped <unk w="in"/> this course and those who have followed it .

We can find its distant origins in <unk w="the"/> report from the Luxembourg <unk w="foreign"/> minister , Pierre <unk w="rapporteur"/> , your predecessor , in 1970 .

<unk w="it"/> was , however , the monetary crisis in the years that followed and the currency <unk w=","/> which triggered action in this area .

As long as the currency exchange rates were fixed , the <unk w="auction"/> system did <unk w="not"/> upset our attempt to create a common market .

After the unsuccessful attempts to create a monetary snake , the strong momentum from France and Germany between 1975 and 1980 led to the meeting in Bremen , in northern Germany , and the decision to create the European Monetary <unk w="fund"/> and introduce the ecu , the euro <unk w="has"/> precursor .

<unk w="the"/> move had the backing and support of our partners in the Benelux <unk w="union"/> and Italy .

After a period of little activity between 1980 and 1988 , the process was given new impetus with the <unk w="commission"/> by the Council of the <unk w="commission"/> chaired by Jacques Delors , resulting in the signature <unk w="of"/> the Maastricht Treaty .

<unk w="let"/> us salute the pioneers who have been involved in <unk w="them"/> along the <unk w="lines"/> , as you yourself have recently , <unk w="madam"/> President , as <unk w="well"/> as my friend , Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and his Secretary of <unk w="state"/> , Manfred Lahnstein ; Bernard Clappier , the governor of the Banque de France at the time and co-author of Robert Schuman 's Declaration in <unk w="colombia"/> ; Alexandre Lamfalussy , who provided us <unk w="in"/> his great , almost unique expertise during the work of the committee <unk w="on"/> European monetary union which we <unk w="drew"/> up with Helmut Schmidt to relaunch the project ; Jacques Delors , President of the European Commission , who <unk w="took"/> over ; and , last but not <unk w="least"/> , the negotiators and signatories of the Maastricht Treaty who drafted an excellent text , <unk w="which"/> has not actually been touched since then , headed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President François Mitterrand , whose determination must be mentioned in particular , along with their other <unk w="colleagues"/> .

Today <unk w="we"/> must say a big ' thank you ' to all of them .

I will <unk w="not"/> go into detail <unk w="when"/> you have only given me five minutes .

In 10 years the euro has become the <unk w="first"/> two currency in the world and , as has been mentioned <unk w="just"/> now , one of <unk w="the"/> most respected <unk w="here"/> .

Its sound <unk w="policy"/> has provided a protective shield against the crisis and a platform for non-inflationary growth .

Without the existence of the euro , mainland Europe would be <unk w="being"/> turned upside down by a monetary tornado , which <unk w="would"/> deepen the economic crisis .

We are expecting the <unk w="european"/> policy to <unk w="continue"/> to contain , within <unk w="the"/> limits of the currency 's power , the depressing impact of the crisis and to pave <unk w="the"/> way for the return to non-inflationary growth , which we are not tackling <unk w="jointly"/> , by which time the sizeable public deficits and level of debt triggered by the crisis ought to have <unk w="been"/> cleared .

In this respect , we <unk w="are"/> putting our trust <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="commission"/> and staff at <unk w="the"/> European Central Bank , who <unk w="have"/> demonstrated their considerable expertise <unk w="from"/> the start of the crisis .

We must be careful not to try to give the <unk w="railways"/> a <unk w="human"/> dimension , which would flatter <unk w="the"/> vanity , but would multiply the risks we face .

The euro is Europe 's currency and must express its distinct culture , promoting a rational and stable model among the world 's other <unk w="cultures"/> .

Finally , I do <unk w="not"/> think that the general public <unk w="will"/> need to wait too long for <unk w="the"/> regulation to be <unk w="introduced"/> in the euro area .

It seems to <unk w="me"/> that <unk w="we"/> could call on <unk w="the"/> European Central <unk w="bank"/> to carry out this process of restoring order <unk w="to"/> supervise its implementation , according to Article 106 ( 5 ) of the <unk w="ec"/> Treaty .

Indeed , we need a <unk w="new"/> impetus , expertise and a decision timetable which the European Central Bank could draw up and which the <unk w="council"/> of Ministers for the euro area , presided by your good self , Mr Juncker , could then adopt and implement .

I <unk w="shall"/> conclude , Mr President , by saying that the symbol of integration represented by the euro 's success must give us the courage to take the next <unk w="step"/> in creating this increasingly <unk w="important"/> Europe as <unk w="well"/> under the various treaties and which <unk w="we"/> are endeavouring to achieve .

Let us counter the inevitability of failure with the energy <unk w="market"/> success .

Mr President , the euro is the successful outcome of a <unk w="democratic"/> and political will , <unk w="but"/> not the product of the market .

It demonstrates the best that Europe can <unk w="do"/> when <unk w="it"/> joins forces .

I also want , of course , on this <unk w="right"/> to salute and thank <unk w="you"/> our behalf , on our children 's behalf <unk w=","/> on everyone else 's behalf , <unk w="the"/> founding fathers and the architects of this success : Pierre Werner , who is with us , Chancellor Helmut <unk w="schmidt"/> , President Giscard d 'Estaing , the President of <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="republic"/> Jacques Delors , Chancellor Helmut Kohl , President François Mitterrand , Baron Alexandre Lamfalussy , Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa , Philippe Maystadt and everyone <unk w="of"/> whom I have not mentioned .

I would also , however , like to pay tribute to the actions of your predecessors , Mr President , the actions of my predecessors , Karl von Wogau , who is still with <unk w="it"/> , and of Christa Randzio-Plath , who is <unk w="working"/> with us today .

The actions of this Parliament <unk w="is"/> a crucial <unk w="role"/> in that , <unk w="at"/> the time of the transition to the euro , we were not only concerned about the transfer of accounts in the banks but also about our citizens , <unk w="so"/> that they could adapt to , get used to and adopt this new currency which <unk w="is"/> going to be theirs .

I also believe that this action by <unk w="our"/> institution must be recalled and given credit .

I <unk w="am"/> also pleased that this <unk w="debate"/> can <unk w="take"/> place here , <unk w="in"/> the European <unk w="union"/> , the home <unk w="of"/> democracy <unk w=","/> all Europe 's citizens .

After all , the euro is first and foremost the concern of us <unk w="all"/> , and then of the <unk w="commission"/> .

<unk w="this"/> is certainly the concern of Europeans , as they are happy to tell us .

However , Europeans themselves have adopted the <unk w="same"/> as a symbol of belonging to the European Union .

There were 11 <unk w="of"/> us <unk w="to"/> start with , <unk w="and"/> now there are <unk w="problems"/> .

However , I do get the feeling <unk w="that"/> this crisis is tempting some countries to reconsider whether they should belong <unk w="to"/> the euro area <unk w="or"/> not .

I think that <unk w="this"/> is the best proof of our success .

Europe makes progress , as is so often the case , by demonstrating its efficiency and on this occasion <unk w="to"/> mark its <unk w="50th"/> anniversary , <unk w="we"/> can clearly see that the assessment of the <unk w="report"/> is largely a positive one .

Some countries <unk w="that"/> were hesitant <unk w="and"/> now knock on the door of the <unk w="free-trade"/> area .

We can only encourage them to do this under the terms of <unk w="the"/> Treaty , which have never been <unk w="said"/> and which are useful terms allowing Europe to progress in economic and monetary <unk w="union"/> on the basis of the two pillars of consolidation and enlargement .

The euro , which has been enriched by these last <unk w="ten"/> years , must <unk w="be"/> open up new areas for development , not that we have not dealt with these at all , but simply because they are still <unk w="not"/> in progress <unk w="all"/> of us .

On the <unk w="basis"/> of economic cooperation , Jean-Claude Juncker described the crisis that we are going through .

In this current crisis we all know that , <unk w="if"/> we had made progress in the Economic <unk w="sector"/> as quickly as <unk w="we"/> have in the Monetary Union , we would be even better off today .

It is not <unk w="possible"/> for <unk w="us"/> to focus on the budget deficit balances and not on the quality of public spending .

It is not normal for Member States to borrow at such different rates of interest when they <unk w="become"/> the same currency and the same rate of interest set by the European Central Bank .

President Giscard d 'Estaing mentioned <unk w="rule"/> 105 ( 6 ) , which is our common platform , allowing us <unk w="to"/> make progress .

I think that <unk w="one"/> of the lessons <unk w="of"/> this crisis is that it actually shows that the European Central Bank will need <unk w="to"/> have a supervisory role .

We do not <unk w="intend"/> to disconnect the supervision of the <unk w="financial"/> markets from macroprudential supervision .

However , to achieve this , we will also <unk w="ensure"/> , as political leaders , to think about achieving a balance .

If the European Central Bank sees its responsibilities strengthened , it <unk w="would"/> have to be indicated how the institutional balance on the whole needs to be established <unk w="in"/> the future .

I agree that we <unk w="do"/> not demand the exorbitant privilege of being <unk w="a"/> reserve currency .

However , it is not normal either for us to have taken 10 years to <unk w="make"/> the euro and then , 10 years after the transition to the <unk w="treaty"/> , we are still passive in the international arena and the strong voice of the euro <unk w="is"/> not being heard <unk w="very"/> clearly <unk w="in"/> the process of restoring some balance to the global monetary system .

This <unk w="is"/> why it is a <unk w="difficult"/> issue for this Parliament .

It is a tool at <unk w="the"/> service of our citizens who are going through the deepest crisis in years .

We must then <unk w="use"/> this wonderful creation , this <unk w="sort"/> of Europe to help our citizens come through this crisis in <unk w="the"/> best conditions <unk w="attached"/> .

Mr President , 10 years of the euro is indeed a reason to <unk w="go"/> .

Anyone who had said 10 years ago that <unk w="the"/> euro would have developed as splendidly <unk w="as"/> it has done would have been laughed at .

Many people have contributed to this success , and I remember many sceptical voices - it was referred to as a premature baby and <unk w="the"/> unviable project - and <unk w="and"/> we know that it was a vision to which many people contributed .

The previous <unk w="speaker"/> reminded <unk w="me"/> of all <unk w="those"/> who contributed to this , of the milestones , of the European <unk w="legal"/> system , which was an agreement with the European Central Bank <unk w="to"/> create central rates , of the Delors report , which provided for the introduction of the monetary union in three stages , of the Treaty of <unk w="amsterdam"/> - only two years after the <unk w="fall"/> of the Wall - and of the transitional periods .

As the committee chairman , Mrs Berès , has already said , during this period , <unk w="in"/> particular from 1994 when <unk w="the"/> implementation of the Treaty of Maastricht began , and up to 2002 , Parliament actively cooperated in the introduction of the notes <unk w="and"/> coins , and in many reports , discussions , opinions and <unk w="your"/> proposals , and I would <unk w="like"/> specifically to thank the two committee chairmen from that time , Mr von Wogau and Mrs <unk w="lucas"/> , <unk w="who"/> also <unk w="for"/> Parliament to the outside world and who gave this project , although originally <unk w="caused"/> by the <unk w="commission"/> , the parliamentary support it needed .

We are working today , too , under the chairmanship of Mrs Berès , <unk w="on"/> the same representation .

On 18 November Parliament adopted , with a large majority , a <unk w="situation"/> in which we describe the <unk w="approach"/> , challenges , risks and problems , and I would like to mention just a few things in addition to what Mrs Berès has said .

The euro has been a great success , and it is a unique project : a central monetary policy under the management of the European Central Bank <unk w="on"/> local budgetary and finance <unk w="programmes"/> .

It is important that , in future , the connection between <unk w="the"/> two levels of <unk w="development"/> in the Stability and Growth Pact are <unk w="still"/> also during times of crisis .

Without this Stability <unk w="and"/> Growth Pact , without stronger coordination of the budgetary and finance policy , the euro would also in <unk w="fact"/> face risks that are avoidable .

In <unk w="this"/> regard , I <unk w="am"/> in <unk w="order"/> to <unk w="the"/> Member States of the euro <unk w="zone"/> , but also to the <unk w="future"/> of the European Union , to take this discipline , this coordinated cooperation , more seriously than has been the case in the <unk w="prisons"/> in connection with certain issues .

The euro has pushed down <unk w="them"/> considerably and so created confidence and stability , and it has become the second most commonly held reserve currency in a <unk w="period"/> of time that no one thought it capable of .

<unk w="the"/> euro has <unk w="increased"/> the pressure for structural <unk w="reform"/> in the Member States and therefore , even in the <unk w="process"/> of globalisation , has become a ' fitness programme ' for undertakings and for nations .

The <unk w="value"/> of the euro area - several were mentioned by the previous speaker - the <unk w="european"/> Council , the Euro Group and many other <unk w="countries"/> have created the necessary conditions together with the Commission and the European Central Bank , because <unk w="we"/> were already <unk w="mentioned"/> , because they were in place , because they worked independently in order <unk w="to"/> react quickly , reliably and correctly in the economic crisis .

The political conclusion from these common successes is that states with a common currency <unk w="and"/> a common <unk w="internal"/> market have achieved a unique level of <unk w="cooperation"/> that will secure peace and prosperity .

However , we cannot necessarily <unk w="support"/> the euro for granted in future .

<unk w="there"/> are numerous specific requests and demands to take the <unk w="agenda"/> seriously : the drifting apart of the national economies , which is associated with considerable risks in connection <unk w="with"/> the growth of wages and with budget deficits , should not be concealed on this anniversary .

An entirely different <unk w="issue"/> is the <unk w="balanced"/> development of the interest rates for <unk w="human"/> bonds .

We are currently seeing the interest rate <unk w="rate"/> , which <unk w="has"/> no doubt decreased , increasing again , bringing the possibility of new problems in this regard for individual Member States within the euro <unk w="zone"/> .

I would remind the House that , particularly in connection with the expansion of <unk w="the"/> euro area , no special rebates may be given and that all states that are members of the euro area can , and must , comply with these conditions of the Treaty of Maastricht .

It has passed the first test <unk w="which"/> has provided a unique contribution to the permanent integration of our nations in Europe .

Mr President , Mr Giscard d 'Estaing , Mr Juncker , Mr <unk w="swoboda"/> , Mr Almunia , ladies and gentlemen , many good <unk w="amendments"/> have <unk w="already"/> been made .

In 10 years , <unk w="the"/> euro has become a strong symbol for Europe .

Yet the idea that Europe could create a single currency , whose foundations were laid especially in the <unk w="peace"/> agreement on the monetary system in 1978 and the creation of <unk w="a"/> ecu , would have been met at the time with scepticism from the markets and <unk w="the"/> main monetary authorities outside Europe .

We should warmly thank and congratulate all those who made the decision and whose names have been <unk w="approved"/> here .

The creation of the <unk w="consumer"/> is the best proof that Europe is capable , given the political will , to take long-term decisions for a common , prosperous future .

This anniversary , then , gives us a particularly apt message <unk w="and"/> hope for today 's times .

It must be said , however , that among our fellow citizens and until recently there <unk w="is"/> mixed perceptions of the euro .

<unk w="all"/> those who travel , the advantage of a single currency was obvious .

For <unk w="those"/> who do not , the euro was <unk w="paying"/> with price rises .

Studies have , <unk w="in"/> fact , shown that in most countries inflation <unk w="have"/> felt even though the <unk w="tragic"/> figures showed that , due <unk w="specifically"/> to the action of the European Central Bank , monetary stability had been ensured .

The reality is <unk w="that"/> some definitely took <unk w="part"/> of the euro to round up some prices and perhaps consumers were not vigilant enough .

When the euro has risen against <unk w="the"/> dollar , we have also heard comments from some manufacturers <unk w="and"/> for the most <unk w="recent"/> produce in the euro area but sell outside this area .

The European Central Bank has not been without its critics , who have not called into question its <unk w="way"/> but rather its policy on interest rates , which seemed to be too high .

We all understand that <unk w="the"/> euro is a determining factor in restricting the European repercussions of a crisis imported from the United <unk w="states"/> .

The <unk w="european"/> Central Bank <unk w="has"/> certainly been the most responsive <unk w="central"/> bank .

What would the situation have <unk w="been"/> if the various Member States had each <unk w="right"/> to defend their own individual currency ?

Devaluations would have been inevitable and we would not <unk w="have"/> avoided a currency <unk w="system"/> .

<unk w="i"/> welcome results of the euro must encourage us to continue and to broaden the coordination of economic policies <unk w="and"/> to respect the <unk w="objectives"/> of the Stability and Growth Pact .

It is true , at present , <unk w="any"/> exceptions may and perhaps should be accepted , but they can only be temporary and the objective of balanced public finances must be retained .

High-quality public finances and economic policies are , <unk w="in"/> fact , in the long run , more than ever necessary .

They are the condition for the solidity of our currency , <unk w="the"/> euro .

Mr President , during these times of uncertainty , it is important to <unk w="be"/> able to count on something with a reliable <unk w="solution"/> : the euro .

As I was able to play a bit-part as a <unk w="quarter"/> of the Ecofin Council during the <unk w="period"/> of preparation for the future single currency , I could <unk w="congratulate"/> the <unk w="situation"/> on both sides of the argument and the pussyfooting of the Member States , which ultimately made the <unk w="union"/> into a stronger forum for cooperation ahead of its time .

Furthermore , two of Europe 's finest <unk w="states"/> came about through <unk w="the"/> determination of a few states to forge ahead in making integration something real for all our fellow citizens .

I am referring <unk w="to"/> the <unk w="trade"/> Agreement entailing the free movement of Europeans , which was implemented on the initiative of five states : France , with President <unk w="guinea"/> , Germany , with Chancellor Kohl , along with the <unk w="candidate"/> countries .

Switzerland has now become part of the Schengen <unk w="agreement"/> , but the British and Irish <unk w="government"/> still shying away from this people 's Europe .

President Mitterrand and Chancellor Kohl were also the political architects of the <unk w="commission"/> , even though there were <unk w="some"/> who <unk w="had"/> this monetary success , starting with Jacques Delors .

The first lesson I <unk w="would"/> like <unk w="to"/> draw from <unk w="it"/> is that anyone who wants a better Europe must not be <unk w="capable"/> of intergovernmental action , especially if <unk w="there"/> is a coalition of states which <unk w="would"/> want to move Europe forward .

The Prüm Treaty , which is <unk w="necessary"/> to combat serious crime , is an example of this positive enhanced cooperation for Europe .

At a time when the Constitutional <unk w="process"/> is dead and buried , <unk w="in"/> the ' no ' vote from a strange coalition of political forces not only in France but in the Netherlands too , and when the indigestible piece of <unk w="work"/> known as the ' mini ' <unk w="line"/> of Lisbon is being blocked in Ireland and possibly in the Czech Republic as well , we should prove <unk w="that"/> Europe is still functioning by relying on the huge area of enhanced cooperation .

In any case , the attraction <unk w="of"/> the euro remains intact .

Even in the UK voices are being raised , <unk w="and"/> the country 's <unk w="economic"/> isolation in the face <unk w="of"/> the pound 's collapse , which has seen <unk w="the"/> status <unk w=","/> from that of the world 's reserve currency to a run-of-the-mill currency in less than a century .

Thanks to the consistent actions of Wim Duisenberg , Jean-Claude <unk w=","/> and the likes , the euro has become the world 's second reserve currency in 10 years .

Of course , the dollar remains king for <unk w="such"/> transactions , <unk w="by"/> providing a safe investment , but the colossal debts accumulated by the United <unk w="states"/> in getting the <unk w="north"/> of the world to finance their lifestyle will increasingly sow the seeds of doubt as to the ability of the number one economic power to honour its commitments .

In fact , the financial <unk w="perspective"/> is <unk w="working"/> towards a euro / dollar duopoly .

<unk w="the"/> monetary duopoly regularly goes through parity adjustments which often occur suddenly .

The euro <unk w="will"/> have a <unk w="key"/> role to play in this new stability .

The European <unk w="central"/> Bank ( ECB ) has done what <unk w="is"/> needed to <unk w="do"/> in the face of a global financial crisis ' made in the USA ' .

As Jacques Delors said , the euro is the shield to protect <unk w="the"/> whole of Europe , but the euro <unk w="has"/> not stimulated the European <unk w="union"/> enough so far .

At <unk w="the"/> end of the day , the Commission is only a <unk w="question"/> consultant making suggestions <unk w="which"/> are generally useful , but the real economic players remain <unk w="member"/> states themselves which , unfortunately , are operating in a <unk w="responsible"/> manner .

Although the effective harmonisation of <unk w="the"/> cumulative economic power <unk w="when"/> 27 states could work miracles , <unk w="in"/> Eurogroup , in spite <unk w="of"/> the commendable efforts of Jean-Claude Juncker , <unk w="not"/> only remains an informal discussion group .

In the spring of 1999 , I <unk w="was"/> able to witness <unk w="the"/> attempt made within the <unk w="union"/> by a few finance ministers , including Oskar Lafontaine , <unk w="the"/> Strauss-Kahn , Carlo Ciampi and a few others , to establish economic and monetary <unk w="union"/> between the European Union and <unk w="the"/> European Central Bank .

Wim Duisenberg made the cutting retort : ' there never will be any ex-ante coordination with the <unk w="european"/> Central Bank as you are always going <unk w="to"/> have to react ex-post to our decisions . '

The reason for this is obvious : the ECB is and will remain independent in conducting its monetary policy , but independence does not mean a ban on constructive dialogue between institutions tasked with defending the <unk w="values"/> and common destiny of 500 million Europeans .

There is nothing to prevent states from organising themselves better with regard to achieving proper coordination of their economic policies , whether it is inside the <unk w="country"/> or especially when <unk w="abandoning"/> Europe externally , as Jean-Claude Juncker so sensibly <unk w="is"/> just now .

<unk w="mr"/> President , Mr <unk w="parish"/> d 'Estaing , Mr Juncker , Mr Trichet , Mr Almunia , ladies <unk w="and"/> gentlemen , I find it very regrettable that relatively few <unk w="people"/> are here today for this formal sitting , because it really is a historic event .

We <unk w="have"/> already heard from the various previous speakers how much scepticism there was when the euro <unk w="is"/> first introduced .

It was felt that <unk w="the"/> logistical challenges involved in introducing <unk w="millions"/> of banknotes and coins alone <unk w="cannot"/> be <unk w="used"/> , and the idea that we could combine a common monetary policy with separate fiscal policies in the Member States was seen not just as a major challenge but as simply impossible .

<unk w="this"/> is something of a <unk w="serious"/> political <unk w="issue"/> , and once again <unk w="the"/> words of Walter Hallstein , the first President of <unk w="the"/> Commission , have proven to <unk w="be"/> true : ' Anyone who does not <unk w="live"/> in <unk w="stake"/> in European matters is not a realist . '

The doubts of the citizens , many of whom , in <unk w="the"/> Member States , <unk w="i"/> believed that the <unk w="commission"/> would <unk w="be"/> in <unk w="any"/> price hikes , have now disappeared .

It <unk w="is"/> , I think , be said that , in the European <unk w="central"/> Bank 's first few <unk w="years"/> , Europe and the European <unk w="union"/> were sailing in relatively calm <unk w="and"/> , so that the bank found it pretty easy to pursue a policy of stability .

<unk w="if"/> so , it is worth <unk w="pointing"/> out that the mean inflation rate over the first 10 years of <unk w="the"/> euro has been <unk w="by"/> 2 % , in other words more or less on the target that the European Central Bank set itself .

The German mark , on the other hand , which was always held up as a poster child <unk w="for"/> stability , had a mean inflation rate of 3 % over its 50 years of existence .

<unk w="it"/> can therefore be said that the <unk w="european"/> Central Bank has performed very <unk w="carefully"/> .

However , it is now , in this time <unk w="the"/> crisis , that the European Central Bank is showing its true strength , <unk w="a"/> true <unk w="nature"/> .

<unk w="it"/> has proven itself to be independent , efficient and self-confident , and it acts decisively and quickly .

It has become an example for some <unk w="european"/> banks , both in those European countries that are not yet part of the euro area and outside Europe .

<unk w="it"/> has <unk w="made"/> it quite clear to the Federal <unk w="union"/> in the <unk w="member"/> States that it can pursue a successful policy , not despite its independence but precisely because it is politically independent <unk w=","/> not subject to instructions <unk w="from"/> various governments .

We now know that at the moment , after the banking sectors in the individual Member States have been brought under a protective umbrella , the Member States are in the process of developing various economic <unk w="policy"/> plans to absorb the <unk w="environmental"/> impact of the financial crisis on the real economy .

This will <unk w="help"/> the European Central Bank with further challenges , <unk w="and"/> there is a risk that the differences in approach will result in distortions of competition , and <unk w="in"/> the convergence we have , in part , now achieved between <unk w="the"/> members of the euro area will be lost and we will see increasingly divergent developments .

This needs to be counteracted , which is why it is so crucial and so <unk w="is"/> that the Stability and Growth Pact must not be <unk w="defined"/> or discarded .

Quite the reverse : we must ensure that it remains <unk w="possible"/> .

That is why it <unk w="is"/> also so important <unk w="that"/> the <unk w="necessary"/> structural reforms , which the <unk w="commission"/> and the European Central Bank have repeatedly called for <unk w="in"/> the past , actually to be pursued in the individual Member States .

The European Central Bank <unk w="will"/> gain a new task in the coming years .

The <unk w="commission"/> has taught <unk w="us"/> that we need some kind <unk w="of"/> European supervision of the financial market , and this is <unk w="an"/> area where <unk w="the"/> European Central Bank can play a <unk w="major"/> role .

It has signalled <unk w="that"/> it is , <unk w="in"/> principle , willing to introduce some kind <unk w="of"/> central <unk w="european"/> supervisory system analogous to the European System of Central Banks .

The euro area <unk w="is"/> to speak with one voice , and also be represented as a <unk w="forum"/> in international organisations such as the International Monetary Fund and the OECD ( Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ) .

<unk w="it"/> is still true that a single currency without a single fiscal economic policy is , <unk w="there"/> will continue to be , a risky undertaking .

The EU is still facing some major <unk w="problem"/> : we are facing high , and unfortunately rising , levels of unemployment , demographic changes , migratory pressures , <unk w="and"/> poverty in some sectors of society , and stiffer competition in the context of globalisation .

The <unk w="proposal"/> of a president of the euro area was the first step in this direction , but it is only the first step : more is now needed .

<unk w="mr"/> President , ladies <unk w="and"/> gentlemen , after <unk w="ten"/> years , the growing space carved out by the <unk w="eu"/> in international trade and its use as a reserve currency <unk w="and"/> that it has become a world benchmark .

It has guaranteed monetary stability and has helped integrate the economies of <unk w="the"/> Member States that have adopted <unk w="them"/> , despite some <unk w="sort"/> of judgment that created problems for citizens both because of the actual exchange rates between national currencies and the euro and because of the few checks subsequently carried <unk w="out"/> on the prices of goods and services .

The <unk w="situation"/> was created without <unk w="restrictions"/> imposed from outside and without any wars of conquest or political hegemonies .

<unk w="this"/> was the result of the <unk w="council"/> coming together of 11 governments who believed in the creation of an economic and monetary union , as laid down in the Treaties , as an essential step in attempting to achieve the political union that still unfortunately remains out of our grasp .

Some problems that have <unk w="made"/> are due to inefficiencies in a system <unk w="that"/> was unprepared for the task of guiding the other great associated <unk w="countries"/> ; I <unk w="am"/> talking <unk w="about"/> the increasing pace of internationalisation and the great changes in the way trade is <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> at international <unk w="level"/> .

The <unk w="commission"/> has made it possible <unk w="to"/> face up to a series of difficulties , the most severe of which is the current <unk w="economic"/> crisis , and it has protected us against the great stresses that have ravaged the <unk w="situation"/> .

Were it not <unk w="only"/> the euro , we <unk w="will"/> have repeated the experience of 1992 , only worse .

We mark this 10th anniversary by warmly <unk w="highlighting"/> the entrance of Slovakia , the 16th country to join the euro area .

The measures introduced by the European Central Bank ( ECB ) and the <unk w="decision"/> to combat the current crisis have acted as a buffer and a form of containment but we still <unk w="need"/> , as we have often done in this Chamber , that <unk w="we"/> find it inconceivable to have a <unk w="consistent"/> policy <unk w="resulting"/> from economic <unk w="policy"/> .

Admittedly , the <unk w="current"/> situation is <unk w="very"/> anomalous : 16 Member States with the single <unk w="market"/> , 27 national economic policies coordinated by the Commission as well as it can , and <unk w="the"/> Member States with national currencies .

<unk w="creating"/> a monetary policy with an economic policy that does not actually exist is certainly no mean feat , but if the institutions responsible for economic policies in our countries do not communicate with the central banks and the ECB , which has to pull all those policies together , and <unk w="vice"/> versa , the European Union will find new difficulties in jointly facing up to the current crisis <unk w="but"/> also the continual challenges that the outside world and globalisation bring home <unk w="to"/> us .

We hope that recent experiences convince people of <unk w="the"/> need to <unk w="make"/> up to change in <unk w="society"/> , restoring the real economy to the centre and ensuring better cohesion <unk w="in"/> connection between the ECB and the European institutions responsible for laying down political and planning strategy .

If the political will is present , the introduction <unk w="of"/> such a policy will be facilitated by the growing power of the euro .

Mr President , <unk w="the"/> Giscard d 'Estaing , <unk w="professor"/> Juncker , Mr Trichet , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to <unk w="ask"/> you how , in 1992 , when it was <unk w="not"/> completely dubious as to whether the French <unk w="will"/> vote in favour <unk w="of"/> the Maastricht Treaty , <unk w="jacques"/> Delors <unk w=","/> to the general <unk w="protocol"/> of the French Green Party , which managed to <unk w="reduce"/> the missing 1 % or 2 % .

The Maastricht Treaty <unk w="was"/> approved , but no <unk w="of"/> Europe was created .

Firstly , it <unk w="seems"/> to us that <unk w="the"/> Maastricht criteria were going to drag Europe into at least five years of pro-cyclical recessionary policy and , secondly , the way in which the monetary policy was incorporated into the <unk w="european"/> economic policy by the Maastricht <unk w="treaty"/> was not satisfactory .

For the sake of the European Central Bank 's independence , we would separate monetary policy from the <unk w="domain"/> of the policies .

I must say quite honestly that , even if I <unk w="am"/> still <unk w="not"/> convinced by the Maastricht Treaty today , like all <unk w="the"/> other Greens , I am rather attracted by the changes which the legislation <unk w="in"/> application of Economic and Monetary Union have undergone .

At the moment , when <unk w="the"/> world is being threatened by deflation and the situation is being aggravated <unk w="by"/> the tendency of <unk w="third"/> countries to hastily cut their VAT rate as part of a Keynesian policy , it is obvious <unk w="that"/> setting this target of 2 % is no <unk w="longer"/> just for show .

If we fail to keep to this 2 % target we run the risk of having very high real interest rates <unk w="and"/> forced on <unk w="it"/> .

The <unk w="second"/> major reform <unk w="is"/> obviously the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact carried out in 2005 , which allows <unk w="us"/> today to have a policy that is contracyclical and aimed at countering the crisis .

This permanent dialogue , as highlighted once again in this Chamber , between Mr Trichet , <unk w="mr"/> Almunia , Mr Juncker and Mr Barroso , is , strictly speaking , contrary to the Maastricht Treaty itself .

I regard this form of cooperation between Mr Trichet and Mr Almunia , <unk w="for"/> example , <unk w="would"/> be the <unk w="result"/> of that between Mr Bernanke and Mr Paulson , which <unk w="is"/> a <unk w="sustainable"/> and desirable development .

All I would say is that we need <unk w="to"/> apply properly <unk w="to"/> good aspects of the Maastricht Treaty .

We have a real problem in defining the <unk w="interest"/> rate , which has been <unk w="mentioned"/> on several occasions by my predecessors .

The task of setting the exchange <unk w="rate"/> is assigned to the Council .

We must find the means to ensure that the Council sets an <unk w="interest"/> rate for Europe which does not derive randomly from the interest rate chosen <unk w="by"/> the <unk w="european"/> Central Bank , but properly reflects an industrial policy .

Secondly , <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="central"/> Bank 's objective is not only to maintain a rate close to 2 % but also to apply Europe <unk w="'s"/> policy , by that I <unk w="welcome"/> the Lisbon and Gothenburg Strategies .

We need to have a policy for refinancing and rediscounting private debts by the European Central Bank according to the <unk w="objectives"/> and Lisbon Strategies .

Lastly , as has already been mentioned , there needs <unk w="to"/> be supervision at a <unk w="global"/> level and the European Central Bank is in the best position to perform this function .

It is regrettable that we are not <unk w="taking"/> advantage of <unk w="the"/> opportunity for an in-depth examination <unk w="of"/> the consequences of implementing neoliberal and monetarist policies - <unk w="of"/> the euro as an excuse - which have contributed to <unk w="the"/> current serious social situation and to increasing inequality , unemployment , precarious and <unk w="less"/> paid work , and poverty .

It is unacceptable that we <unk w="are"/> holding onto ideological dogmas , <unk w="such"/> as price stability and <unk w="the"/> irrational criteria of the Stability and <unk w="growth"/> Pact , which are being used as a pretext <unk w="in"/> order <unk w="to"/> pursue privatisation and remove responsibility for social functions from the <unk w="union"/> .

<unk w="this"/> approach also involves the idea of the minimal state and the <unk w="energy"/> efficiency of the private sector , with the aim of imposing acceptance of so-called wage <unk w="standards"/> , which actually <unk w="exist"/> in low , nominal wage rises and even a reduction in real wages , as the Portuguese case regrettably <unk w="clearly"/> demonstrates .

We cannot agree with <unk w="the"/> false independence of the European Central Bank , which is dragging its heels on the decisions to reduce interest rates and which is keeping the <unk w="right"/> overvalued solely to protect those countries with more developed economies and the more powerful economic and financial groups , thus worsening the hardships of the more fragile economies and those people with fewer financial resources .

This European Central Bank policy has resulted in the contraction of the European economy , clearly demonstrating the need for further reductions in the reference interest <unk w="issues"/> .

As the <unk w="economic"/> power of workers , the retired <unk w="and"/> pensioners has fallen over the last 10 <unk w="years"/> , the profits of economic and financial groups have reached their highest level in 30 years , resulting in the joy and satisfaction <unk w="that"/> we have heard in this Chamber .

Even now , in the crisis situation that they have caused , what they are <unk w="doing"/> is nationalising the damage <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> order to then privatise <unk w="their"/> profits , whilst workers , micro- and small entrepreneurs , the retired and the unemployed suffer the consequences of the crisis , with <unk w="the"/> right , in the best-case scenario , only to a few scraps .

Look at what is happening in <unk w="the"/> financial sector , where certain banks have already increased their spreads more than once since the start of the financial crisis and where <unk w="the"/> margin charged has doubled in the space <unk w="of"/> a year , thereby penalising <unk w="any"/> credit even more .

We <unk w="must"/> insist <unk w="that"/> the <unk w="urgent"/> need for a proper <unk w="dialogue"/> with these neoliberal and monetarist policies , putting an <unk w="end"/> to the Stability Pact , tax havens and the false <unk w="use"/> of the <unk w="european"/> Central Bank .

We <unk w="therefore"/> insist <unk w="on"/> the need to significantly increase the EU budget based on a fair distribution of income and wealth , so that there is a real policy of economic and social cohesion and so that we <unk w="take"/> measures that are just more of the <unk w="economy"/> , in other words ' save yourself <unk w=","/> you can ' measures , allowing <unk w="the"/> richest to become ever richer and the <unk w="lowest"/> to become ever poorer , as clearly <unk w="defined"/> by the increasing inequalities <unk w="and"/> disparities among the euro area <unk w="too"/> .

We therefore insist on the need to support production and micro- , small and medium-sized enterprises ; <unk w="to"/> promote <unk w="their"/> public services ; to facilitate <unk w="transparency"/> and <unk w="reduce"/> the purchasing power of families , and not just the most disadvantaged , but <unk w="in"/> the middle classes ; to create more <unk w="insecurity"/> , and to reduce the poverty and misery of millions of people in our <unk w="continent"/> .

on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - <unk w="mr"/> President , do enjoy the 10th birthday <unk w="on"/> the euro <unk w="and"/> I very much doubt you will be celebrating the 20th .

What we have seen this morning has been <unk w="part"/> of the old Soviet times .

<unk w="do"/> you remember when the five-year plans were <unk w="going"/> to be successes often before <unk w="they"/> were even launched , with <unk w="the"/> talk of record harvests and <unk w="the"/> production figures for tractors ?

Much <unk w="of"/> those days , <unk w="who"/> have been treated this <unk w="subject"/> to a <unk w="series"/> of unelected , ageing bureaucrats telling us what a great success the whole thing has been .

It was last July when <unk w="the"/> European Central Bank put interest rates up , just at the very moment that the markets were going into meltdown and rates <unk w="are"/> being slashed across the rest of the world .

Of course none of this surprises me <unk w=","/> what this <unk w="directive"/> is all about is a political class imposing its will <unk w="on"/> the peoples of Europe .

Remember that only <unk w="seven"/> countries - Denmark and Sweden - had a referendum on the euro and both of them said ' no ' , that little word that you try and avoid if you possibly can .

The euro zone has never been tested <unk w="and"/> it is about to be .

Italy , as German economists at the <unk w="same"/> said , <unk w="i"/> never have joined the euro , but the situation <unk w="in"/> Greece is , I think , where we should focus our attention .

<unk w="categories"/> of young people out on the streets demonstrating , demanding their government does something , demanding that their government cuts rates , demanding that their government devalues .

When people have taken away from them the ability to determine their own futures <unk w="through"/> the ballot box , then I am afraid <unk w="that"/> violence becomes the only logical alternative .

What you have <unk w="dealt"/> with this euro is you have trapped people in an economic prison .

You have trapped people in a Völkerkerker from <unk w="doing"/> it will <unk w="have"/> great courage to get out .

It will take leadership , or possibly the <unk w="european"/> economic <unk w="situation"/> .

<unk w="i"/> can boo , you can jeer , but remember this : Britain outside of the euro has been able to devalue , has been able to slash interest rates .

We have been <unk w="trying"/> to do the things that <unk w="we"/> need to do .

Jeer on if you like , but have you noticed that on the <unk w="energy"/> markets this morning Greek bonds <unk w="on"/> trading 233 basis <unk w="for"/> higher than German <unk w="farmers"/> ?

Now I know that most of <unk w="you"/> in this <unk w="house"/> will not even know what <unk w="the"/> means and those that do will do their best to ignore it .

You can go on <unk w="to"/> your heads in the sand if you want .

<unk w="we"/> can ignore the markets <unk w="if"/> you want to , but in time the markets will not ignore you .

Mr President , <unk w="in"/> the last 200 years there have been at least half a dozen attempts to <unk w="use"/> single currencies or fixed exchange rate <unk w="mechanism"/> .

All have failed , all <unk w="and"/> damaged the participants , and so it is with the <unk w="commission"/> .

The imbalances <unk w="are"/> predicted by sceptics are starting <unk w="with"/> bite .

<unk w="today"/> 's experience is <unk w="on"/> the bull in the corrida : proud and strong to start with , but <unk w="also"/> to death in the sand by the end .

Greece 's recent unrest is clearly linked to unemployment , resulting <unk w="in"/> an overvalued euro .

Bond spreads between Greece and Germany have <unk w="reached"/> unprecedented levels - <unk w="the"/> 200 basis points .

<unk w="in"/> writing . - The tenth anniversary of the vote on the proposal , presented to Parliament , on <unk w="behalf"/> of the <unk w="council"/> of Ministers , by Gordon Brown ( <unk w="the"/> president of the Council ) , to lock exchange rates at that day 's level and to create the euro , is an opportunity to celebrate ten years of success , stability and strength of <unk w="colombia"/> is now one of the two leading currencies in the world .

The current economic crisis would <unk w="have"/> been <unk w="achieved"/> by turmoil on currency markets had we still had the <unk w="impression"/> , lira , drachma and so on as <unk w="other"/> currencies <unk w="are"/> wildly against each other .

The euro has <unk w="been"/> a rock of stability for its members , as illustrated by the contrasting fortunes of Iceland and Ireland .

The anniversary is also <unk w="an"/> opportunity to <unk w="discuss"/> whether Britain 's long-term economic future lies with euro membership .

Of <unk w="course"/> , Britain can <unk w="be"/> in the <unk w="long"/> run outside the euro , but over time , we stand to lose out : our businesses are handicapped in the European market by conversion costs and hedging costs that their competitors in that market do not face ; and inward investors into the European market will prefer to be in the major currency area rather than the smaller one .

The formal sitting of the European <unk w="union"/> marking the 10th anniversary of Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) at a time of serious crisis in the capitalist system <unk w=","/> repeated resolutions and reports <unk w="by"/> the European Parliament on the same subject and is yet another attempt to gild the pill of the anti-grassroots , anti-labour <unk w="behalf"/> of the EU which , following the demise of socialism , proceeded to <unk w="the"/> Maastricht Treaty and its all-out attack on labour rights and freedoms .

EMU , the establishment of the European Central Bank and the launch of the euro are necessary <unk w=","/> in the chain of capitalist <unk w="markets"/> being promoted by capital in order <unk w="to"/> defend itself against workers ' claims and safeguard its profitability by stepping up the exploitation <unk w="of"/> the working class and grassroots classes .

EMU protects the profits of <unk w="the"/> monopolies and facilitates privatisation and merger .

This past decade , workers have seen their incomes shrink , industrial <unk w="or"/> worsen , their insurance rights evaporate and health and education services deteriorate and made <unk w="them"/> privatised commodities .

<unk w="we"/> reject <unk w="the"/> European one-way street and its supporters , <unk w="but"/> also the Lisbon Strategy and the Lisbon Treaty , and are fighting against EMU and the <unk w="union"/> itself for grassroots power and a grassroots economy .

In <unk w="the"/> debate about the euro I want to draw attention to three <unk w="key"/> aspects of its <unk w="policy"/> .

Firstly , from the moment when the <unk w="aid"/> was introduced , in other words from 2002 to 2007 inclusive , the three Member States which were outside the euro area ( England , Sweden <unk w="and"/> Denmark ) developed <unk w="more"/> than the countries which were in the <unk w="free-trade"/> area .

Gross <unk w="domestic"/> income in those countries grew almost <unk w="almost"/> as fast <unk w="as"/> the <unk w="demand"/> for the euro area , and the level of <unk w="safety"/> was lower .

Secondly , the battle with the effects of the current financial and economic crisis is clearly <unk w="more"/> effective in those <unk w="ways"/> than in the euro area .

The central banks of England , <unk w="ireland"/> and Denmark very quickly <unk w="demonstrated"/> clearly <unk w="their"/> interest rates while ensuring liquidity to commercial banks .

It also seems that the fiscal policy pursued by these countries will be more effective than the fiscal policy <unk w="in"/> the euro area .

<unk w="however"/> , new Member States which are preparing to enter the euro area have to comply with many monetary and fiscal criteria two <unk w=":"/> before entry .

Some <unk w="of"/> these criteria are mutually contradictory , such as the need to be present in the ERM II <unk w="sector"/> - and therefore the need to maintain the national currency 's exchange rate against the euro within a fluctuation band of ± 15 % - and at the same time to maintain a low level of inflation .

Counteracting devaluation pressure on the national currency means the need for intervention by central banks , which means putting greater amounts of the national currency into circulation , which <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> increases inflationary pressure .

As the Commission wants to encourage new <unk w="member"/> States , it should consider eliminating this obvious <unk w="risk"/> .

Mr President , ladies <unk w="and"/> gentlemen , European Economic and <unk w="monetary"/> Union began on 1 January 1999 , and <unk w="the"/> EU Member States adopted <unk w="a"/> single currency at the same time .

<unk w="the"/> euro was 10 years old on 1 January 2009 .

At the same time , <unk w="it"/> became the 16th country to use the euro .

Just as Mr Juncker stated to Parliament in his speech , <unk w="the"/> euro is very definitely an ' anchor of stability ' .

Although the 10th anniversary of the euro is overshadowed by worries of a possible deepening of the recession , I trust <unk w="that"/> the euro area 's ability to emerge from the crisis .

This <unk w="will"/> nevertheless require considerable <unk w="pressure"/> on <unk w="the"/> part of the <unk w="eu"/> .

According to <unk w="the"/> latest estimates , the effect of the agreed stimulus package will be considerably less than the 1.5 % of gross domestic product planned for the area .

The euro has been an unquestionable success , but would not <unk w="have"/> been <unk w="possible"/> for the continuous efforts made .

Now we need to strengthen <unk w="parliament"/> 's role in the supervision of the financial markets .

We have to keep <unk w="to"/> the basic principles and criteria of Economic and Monetary Union .

On 1 January 2009 the euro became <unk w="an"/> official <unk w="republic"/> of Slovakia .

From that date , the double cross on three hills from the Slovak flag has also appeared on one-euro and two-euro <unk w=","/> and has been put <unk w="into"/> circulation across the euro area .

That day was a historic moment for Slovakia and we Slovaks <unk w="be"/> very proud to <unk w="be"/> the first country from the former Socialist bloc to introduce the euro in <unk w="a"/> symbolic year of the 10th anniversary of the euro <unk w="declaration"/> .

I am appreciative of the fact that the current Slovak <unk w="protocol"/> has subscribed to the commitment of Mikuláš Dzurinda , whose cabinet , in autumn 2004 , adopted a plan to replace the koruna with the European currency and fixed the beginning of 2009 as the target date .

It also seems <unk w="to"/> here on the <unk w="part"/> of the EP to thank the Slovak people because it was <unk w="not"/> , <unk w="and"/> the main actors in the challenging but necessary ' Dzurinda ' reforms , who persevered and helped Slovakia to <unk w="build"/> a successful European country .

From 1 January 2009 <unk w="the"/> euro will link the people of Slovakia to the Union every day .

The introduction of the <unk w="irish"/> single currency 10 years <unk w="ago"/> marked the completion of a process whose implications go far beyond the economic sector .

The finalisation of <unk w="the"/> Economic and Monetary Union process demonstrated Member States ' commitment <unk w="to"/> safeguard the EU 's economic and political unity .

The <unk w="commission"/> 's success therefore means success in the process of building an entity designed to promote European values at international level and confirm the <unk w="european"/> Union as the main player in business <unk w="and"/> financial <unk w="management"/> within the global economy .

I believe that <unk w="the"/> benefits offered by adopting the euro , <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> macroeconomic stability , a significant reduction in price fluctuations , the <unk w="issue"/> of job <unk w="creation"/> and support for productivity growth , all underpinned by strengthening resistance to <unk w="public"/> shocks , justify all the efforts made by the <unk w="various"/> Member States , especially Romania , to meet the convergence criteria as soon as possible and join the euro <unk w="externally"/> .

Since the euro was <unk w="adopted"/> on 1 January 1999 , <unk w="the"/> single currency has , in many respects , proven to be an important factor <unk w="in"/> the stability of the EU economy .

<unk w="the"/> single <unk w="market"/> is , first of all , a driving <unk w="force"/> for European exchanges : the disappearance <unk w="of"/> exchange rates <unk w="in"/> the euro countries is an important and visible <unk w="role"/> for citizens , and <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> mobility within the EU .

In addition to the obvious benefits , the euro has also emerged as <unk w="a"/> anchor in the financial crisis .

Only a major <unk w="measure"/> used by many Member States and national economies is able to cushion the dramatic effects of economic collapse .

Monetary union means that macroeconomic levers can be applied at international level and active responses can be made to <unk w="the"/> financial crisis .

Finally , though , the euro <unk w="is"/> also a symbol of European integration <unk w="over"/> the long road <unk w="that"/> the European people have already travelled together .

Monetary union is the next logical step after economic union , <unk w="we"/> should also pave the way for deeper European integration .

<unk w="just"/> one year ago , when marking the 10th anniversary of the creation of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) and Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) , <unk w="has"/> highlighted the fact <unk w="that"/> : ' In the ten years it has <unk w="been"/> in existence , the results achieved by EMU are a resounding success . '

I think that this assessment is quite appropriate as I am a strong believer in the importance of the solidarity <unk w="that"/> Member States need to show in their joint actions to combat the effects of the financial crisis and reduce the adverse impact of the global economic <unk w="sector"/> .

Europe is in its most <unk w="difficult"/> economic situation since the end of the Second World War .

In <unk w="the"/> climate , marking the 10th anniversary <unk w="of"/> the introduction of the euro must refocus our attention on the major European integration projects .

The introduction of the European single currency and the creation <unk w="of"/> EMU were joint decisions made through harmonisation and solidarity based on European values .

This is the <unk w="type"/> of attitude which <unk w="we"/> also need <unk w="one"/> year in <unk w="order"/> to devise <unk w="and"/> successfully implement measures to <unk w="improve"/> the financial crisis .

Europe 's competitiveness <unk w="ought"/> to be maintained within the <unk w="free-trade"/> area and must <unk w="be"/> boosted in Member States <unk w="which"/> are preparing to <unk w="make"/> the euro area .

Furthermore , EMU <unk w="countries"/> ' diverse interests must take <unk w="a"/> priority to <unk w="the"/> EU 's common economic interests .

If not , <unk w="it"/> really needs to come up with a better technical solution .

Madam President , I have been trying <unk w="a"/> wave to an usher throughout the voting procedure in order to give <unk w="explanations"/> of vote , but because you conducted votes so brilliantly and we got through them so quickly , an usher has not quite made it too me yet .

I am holding a piece <unk w="of"/> paper asking to <unk w="why"/> two oral explanations of vote on the <unk w="swoboda"/> and Breyer reports .

I would appreciate it <unk w="if"/> you would allow me to do that .

Madam President , likewise , if I could have the same <unk w="outcome"/> .

( IT ) Madam President , ladies and <unk w="gentlemen"/> , <unk w="it"/> gives me great pleasure to speak in this great parliamentary Chamber , <unk w="not"/> by Members from all 27 of our Member <unk w="states"/> .

I rarely get <unk w="this"/> an opportunity to <unk w="find"/> myself heard by so many .

<unk w="it"/> falls to me on this occasion to explain my <unk w="opinion"/> in <unk w="favour"/> of the report by Mr Belder on trade <unk w="and"/> economic relations with Western Balkans .

I am absolutely in favour of the European Union making <unk w="it"/> as easy <unk w="as"/> possible for these Balkan states to join the European Union .

I believe that it is important for economic aid to be higher than that allocated to date , and that we should make it possible to increase links between the Balkan states and Europe , develop tourism and allow all Balkan citizens , young <unk w="people"/> old , to live a better life than they have <unk w="done"/> now .

<unk w="mr"/> President , first , I just wish to record the fact that I pressed the wrong button on the McGuinness report .

In fact , I completely support the <unk w="annual"/> report on food security - but I will check that with the services later .

I <unk w="cannot"/> agree with the point that we need to adapt <unk w="the"/> CAP to meet food security concerns and the fact that farmers need a stable policy environment in order <unk w="to"/> plan for the future .

In addition , I <unk w="welcome"/> the fact that the market <unk w="economy"/> cannot provide income <unk w="both"/> for <unk w="consumers"/> and also the call for a detailed impact assessment , in particular , let us say , on the implications for food security .

If we look at particular EU proposals , <unk w="for"/> example on plant <unk w="transport"/> , again we need a proper <unk w="environmental"/> impact assessment on that , and we need to take food security into consideration when we conduct that <unk w="legislation"/> .

Madam President , I would like to thank colleagues for their <unk w="support"/> of this report and Marian Harkin for <unk w="the"/> words of <unk w="work"/> .

It presents a clear statement of the <unk w="support"/> of this House on agriculture policy , not just <unk w="at"/> the European level , but also at a global level .

In particular - and this is important - it calls for a refocus on agriculture policy <unk w="in"/> the developing world , providing assistance to those who can produce food to <unk w="do"/> so locally .

I believe <unk w="approximately"/> EUR 1 billion that the European Union will provide for this purpose is a step in <unk w="the"/> right direction .

I believe it is a blueprint for the future in terms of how <unk w="this"/> House views agriculture .

While the food security debate has gone off the political agenda , the problem of 30 000 children dying of hunger and starvation every day <unk w=","/> with us .

Madam President , I am grateful to you for <unk w="giving"/> me the opportunity to explain why I abstained on <unk w="the"/> McGuinness report .

It <unk w="is"/> on a very important aspect of the European Union and that is the absolute essentiality of ensuring <unk w="adequate"/> supplies to those <unk w="who"/> are starving or <unk w="people"/> who do not have a proper <unk w="food"/> supply .

But the <unk w="case"/> with the <unk w="commission"/> , in my view , is that it looks <unk w="only"/> refers to the common agricultural policy and does not address the fact that there is an urgent need for the reform , and further reform , of that policy .

Until that burden is taken <unk w="away"/> from the European taxpayers , then we are going to be in difficulties .

Yes , the objectives of the report are right , <unk w="and"/> I am afraid that it fails very badly in addressing the core problem .

<unk w="the"/> fluctuations in <unk w="oil"/> prices <unk w="are"/> going to <unk w="compete"/> in the global market with increasing frequency , which will have negative consequences .

Price rises are felt most by low-income <unk w="people"/> , who spend a <unk w="large"/> proportion <unk w="of"/> their budget on food .

I agree that the common agricultural policy should be adapted to the new <unk w="regulations"/> in order to better address the problems of food security , and this is why the removal of instruments which <unk w="regulate"/> markets and a reduction in the level of <unk w="agricultural"/> expenditure on <unk w="agriculture"/> in the future financial <unk w="year"/> should be opposed .

It is a good idea to <unk w="create"/> an international body which will observe the prices of agricultural products and factors of their production under the auspices of the Food and Agriculture Organization , in order to monitor these data on a world scale and <unk w="to"/> be able to react rapidly to fluctuations .

I <unk w="welcome"/> the <unk w="idea"/> of a world system of storing food supplies should also be considered .

<unk w="mr"/> President , I am grateful for this <unk w="opportunity"/> to explain why I also abstained on this report .

I think most people in this Chamber , from whatever part of the political spectrum <unk w="has"/> come from , would <unk w="mean"/> that food security is very important .

The problem is that we do not <unk w="agree"/> on what food security is .

To many of us , food <unk w="production"/> is making sure that there <unk w="is"/> enough food for the people of the world - wherever they come from .

Food security <unk w="requires"/> them means <unk w="that"/> food produced in the EU for Europeans .

I <unk w="think"/> people using the excuse of food security to keep out <unk w="it"/> from the <unk w="rest"/> of the world , <unk w="thus"/> condemning the high-quality exports that we see <unk w="how"/> many of <unk w="the"/> poorer countries of the world <unk w="in"/> condemning many <unk w="young"/> farmers in poorer countries to poverty .

To say that a common <unk w="fisheries"/> policy should be the cornerstone of food security is <unk w="an"/> amazing statement which <unk w="is"/> to be shot down .

Madam President , I concur <unk w="with"/> the comments made <unk w="by"/> my excellent colleague Mr Syed Kamall on this <unk w="report"/> .

I abstained because it was my party 's whip to abstain on this report , but <unk w="nobody"/> knows that food security is a very important subject to us all , <unk w="which"/> is why I <unk w="was"/> bemused by the way that this place deals <unk w="with"/> such a matter .

<unk w="in"/> this particular report - which I believe we all voted for - we mention the problem we were just about to create <unk w="not"/> ourselves by <unk w="looking"/> for the plant protection products directive .

About three minutes after we <unk w="voted"/> for this report we were basically ensuring that our farmers would not be able to grow enough food for our continent <unk w="in"/> the future .

It is a shame <unk w="that"/> nobody else <unk w="-"/> to read some of these reports that go through this place .

Madam President , <unk w="one"/> of the biggest <unk w="union"/> and one of the keys in relation to global food security is to ensure sufficient , sustainable production and , indeed , food security in the so-called developed world , such as here in the EU , <unk w="so"/> that <unk w="we"/> can <unk w="be"/> our surplus <unk w=","/> and are not competing ourselves on world <unk w="markets"/> for food , thereby increasing the <unk w="potential"/> for <unk w="those"/> in regions who do not have <unk w="the"/> climate , the soil , the know-how and the <unk w="resources"/> to produce their own food .

We have to be very careful with our policies <unk w="to"/> ensure that we are responding not only environmentally but also globally to the necessity for sustainable food <unk w="production"/> .

( SK ) I voted for the report on the common agricultural policy and global food security because it <unk w="deals"/> with issues that I have consistently been raising in <unk w="the"/> European Parliament as matters of priority .

The first issues involves the reduction in <unk w="the"/> costs , which will lead to greater global competitiveness .

The second issue is <unk w="a"/> reduction in the volatility of food <unk w="safety"/> , especially by increasing stocks .

The third issue concerns halting <unk w="the"/> decline in <unk w="the"/> social importance of agriculture by increasing public awareness of its unique <unk w="and"/> irreplaceable role .

The fourth issue concerns ending the random operation of the common agricultural policy ( <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> ) by implementing a systemic organisation of the policy <unk w="and"/> a focus on long-term objectives .

The fifth and final issue involves putting a stop to the agricultural decline in the new <unk w="member"/> States caused by the CAP 's discriminatory principles , while significantly boosting utilisation of wasted agricultural potential in these countries , <unk w="the"/> new Member States .

Madam President , this <unk w="applies"/> to the core of this whole European Union .

Here <unk w="we"/> are approving more money to try and persuade the public to vote for the wretched Lisbon Treaty .

The public , on <unk w="having"/> given a chance in the Republic of Ireland , <unk w="make"/> it absolutely clear <unk w="that"/> they do not want <unk w="it"/> and if the <unk w="people"/> of Britain were to be given a chance - and they should have been because they were promised it in the last general election by the Labour Government - they would also vote <unk w="and"/> to reject this Treaty .

People <unk w="do"/> not want more <unk w="money"/> in Brussels and <unk w="europe"/> .

People want their own governments and their own legislatures to be <unk w="given"/> the decisions that affect them .

Until that message is received we will keep pumping more <unk w="people"/> ' money into forcing people to <unk w="the"/> polling box in the pretence that you actually persuade them to change their minds .

<unk w="mr"/> President , first of all I would like to say that this is an excellent <unk w="report"/> .

We are always speaking about connecting the EU <unk w="and"/> its citizens and the <unk w="fact"/> that the <unk w="european"/> project cannot proceed <unk w="with"/> the involvement of EU citizens .

There are two types of <unk w="saying"/> : representative , <unk w="and"/> we <unk w="have"/> in this House , and participative , which is what this report is all about .

However , it <unk w="is"/> important to understand that civil dialogue <unk w="is"/> two-sided .

Therefore , the concerns and <unk w="measures"/> put forward <unk w="that"/> citizens must be taken into consideration by the EU institutions .

I disagree with the last speaker <unk w=","/> I <unk w="said"/> , if we do pass the Lisbon Treaty , that it gives <unk w="us"/> the opportunity to connect citizens to the EU in a much <unk w="more"/> meaningful way .

Our role in <unk w="this"/> House is <unk w="to"/> ensure , if we pass the Lisbon Treaty , that it <unk w="is"/> effectively .

Madam President , much can be inferred from the title of this report : ' Perspectives for developing civil dialogue under the <unk w="confines"/> of Lisbon ' .

Never mind that , as it seems periodically necessary to remind this House , the Treaty <unk w="of"/> Lisbon is not in force .

It has been three times rejected in its several forms by 55 % of French voters , by 62 % of Dutch <unk w="farmers"/> and by 54 % of Irish voters .

Focus rather on the Orwellian Ministry of Love bit of <unk w="the"/> title ' Perspectives for developing civil <unk w="society"/> ' .

Now , ordinary voters unversed in the peculiar idiom of the European Union might not understand those words , as <unk w="well"/> in this House do , to <unk w="avoid"/> creating a new propaganda budget to try and convince people to change their minds .

I have to say that not every euro in the vaults of <unk w="the"/> European Central Bank will serve to convince <unk w="us"/> of an intrinsically bad <unk w="light"/> .

The EU has to be able to receive as <unk w="well"/> as <unk w="possible"/> .

Madam President , thank you for giving me the opportunity to explain the way I <unk w="voted"/> on this report .

When I read the title of the report , ' Civil dialogue under the <unk w="confines"/> of Lisbon ' , it reminded me of a <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> by Mahatma Gandhi .

When he was asked about Western <unk w="powers"/> , he <unk w="said"/> , that ' that would be a good idea ' .

Therefore , when I read this title , ' Civil dialogue under the <unk w="confines"/> of Lisbon ' , I thought , ' that would be a good <unk w="idea"/> , would it not ? '

One of the previous <unk w="speakers"/> said that <unk w="there"/> is very much a two-way process , but if we look at some of the civil society organisations being funded in order to promote the <unk w="outcome"/> of Lisbon , we only see organisations that are fully <unk w="backed"/> up to promoting this fundamentally undemocratic Treaty .

There is no two-way dialogue , and that is why the citizens of the EU , when they are given the chance and asked about the Treaty of Lisbon , will choose to reject <unk w="them"/> .

Madam President , <unk w="thank"/> you <unk w="asked"/> for your patience in the Chamber .

I wanted <unk w="to"/> speak on this but I have just got too much to say today , I am so excited by all the votes that have <unk w="been"/> going through the Chamber today .

If you want to look at a sustainable fisheries policy , you have to look at property rights and <unk w="other"/> solutions .

Look at <unk w="those"/> countries where <unk w="they"/> are given rights <unk w="which"/> are tradable and passed on from generation to <unk w="guinea"/> .

That is the best way <unk w="to"/> make sure that we have <unk w="to"/> fish stocks , <unk w="but"/> some artificial communistic method where you have central planning in fishing .

<unk w="that"/> is why we are seeing great depletion of fish stocks , and we <unk w="will"/> all suffer in the end .

<unk w="the"/> President of the Republic of Latvia , the <unk w="former"/> honourable Valdis Zatlers , it is a very great <unk w="opportunity"/> for us all to be able to welcome you today on your first visit to the European Parliament .

I <unk w="would"/> like to start by thanking <unk w="you"/> , as the <unk w="representative"/> of a country which is still a relatively new Member State of the <unk w="european"/> Union , for <unk w="example"/> the European Parliament 's invitation to address us today , the <unk w="situation"/> on which we are celebrating the 10th anniversary of our common currency , <unk w="the"/> euro .

<unk w="this"/> is a premiere in every sense of the word , as this was the first time that the European hymn has been played to welcome a guest to plenary here in the European Parliament .

May I take this <unk w="opportunity"/> to mention once again today the historic significance of the enlargement <unk w="of"/> the European <unk w="union"/> in 2004 .

It took <unk w="over"/> 60 years to bring <unk w="the"/> country back <unk w="to"/> a free and <unk w="democratic"/> Europe and unify our continent .

Our citizens enjoy prospects <unk w="for"/> our <unk w="citizens"/> could only have dreamed of .

Even <unk w="if"/> people of Latvia have come <unk w="to"/> feel this quite clearly , for example as a result of the financial crisis , which has also <unk w="been"/> your <unk w="very"/> hard , Mr President .

The gas <unk w="cooperation"/> between Russia and Ukraine is also giving the citizens of <unk w="the"/> justified cause for concern .

It is <unk w="important"/> in times of crisis that we understand the value of <unk w="enlargement"/> of a European <unk w="union"/> based on the principle of solidarity between <unk w="european"/> peoples .

It is precisely in this time of <unk w="time"/> that we all feel the need for community <unk w="development"/> cooperation <unk w="between"/> our countries and the European institutions .

Together we are stronger , together we can defend our interests and values <unk w="and"/> throughout the world .

That is also why the European Parliament <unk w="adopts"/> the <unk w="maastricht"/> Treaty , <unk w="which"/> gives the European Union a stronger capacity to act to overcome these serious challenges , will shortly enter into force .

In this respect , the European Parliament elections due to take place <unk w="in"/> June this year are immensely important , because we want to push ahead with the success story of the <unk w="european"/> peace and unification project together , in a democratic <unk w="european"/> Union <unk w=","/> a <unk w="european"/> Parliament with codecision powers in nearly every area .

I truly hope that the citizens of Latvia - and of all the other Member <unk w="states"/> of the <unk w="european"/> Union - will understand <unk w="that"/> their vote is important because it gives them European powers of codecision and in this sense will turn out in force <unk w="in"/> the forthcoming elections to the European Parliament .

May I warmly <unk w="congratulate"/> you once again to the European Parliament .

Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I thank the President for <unk w="his"/> kind words of introduction and his invitation to address the elected representatives of the nations of Europe .

I take great pleasure in addressing the European Parliament in my mother tongue , especially <unk w="scheduled"/> for five years now , Latvian <unk w="has"/> been one of the official languages of the European Union .

I am speaking to <unk w="speak"/> today at a <unk w="time"/> when the term of office <unk w="is"/> the first Members of the <unk w="european"/> Parliament <unk w="should"/> be elected from Latvia is drawing to a close .

I thank <unk w="him"/> for <unk w="having"/> carried out your duties with distinction .

<unk w="my"/> friends , this year , 2009 , is a very significant year for Latvia .

It is five <unk w="years"/> since Latvia acceded to the <unk w="european"/> Union and to NATO .

Membership of these international organisations became a strategic aim for Latvia <unk w="and"/> the restoration of independence in 1991 .

Latvia clearly expressed its <unk w="desire"/> to participate in <unk w="democracy"/> and transatlantic economic and security structures .

<unk w="the"/> enlargement of the family of European democratic nations in the first decade <unk w="of"/> the 21st century represented the most dynamic changes in Europe since the foundation of the European Union .

European structures were joined by nations that had long been isolated by force from them , even though the values that lie at the heart of the European Union had historically been rooted in <unk w="the"/> nations .

It once again <unk w="that"/> our steadfast will to live in an independent , free and democratic <unk w="state"/> .

In <unk w="this"/> act declaring the Republic of Latvia in 1918 it is <unk w="clear"/> that : ' All citizens regardless of their <unk w="country"/> origin are called on to give their assistance , for all human rights shall be guaranteed in Latvia .

<unk w="ten"/> years before <unk w="the"/> adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the Republic of Latvia declared its <unk w="opposition"/> to its fundamental values and principles .

<unk w="it"/> has always felt itself to belong to Europe and its values , even when Latvia and <unk w="the"/> Central and Eastern <unk w="european"/> nations were long bound to a state where many values were looked at through a special ideological prism .

Peace reigned among the nations of the Eastern bloc , but it <unk w="is"/> the peace of the prison courtyard .

It was brought about <unk w="by"/> the presence <unk w="of"/> tanks , repression and threats .

Last year , ladies and gentlemen , both you and the whole of <unk w="parliament"/> were reminded of the inhumanity of totalitarian ideology by Edvīns  nore 's film ' A Soviet Story ' .

You have to look back into the past in <unk w="order"/> to understand one another and look to the future <unk w="too"/> .

That is why I should like to thank <unk w="the"/> European Parliament for the declaration adopted on 22 September last year to proclaim 23 August as the European <unk w="ministry"/> of Remembrance for <unk w="hundreds"/> of Stalinism <unk w="and"/> Nazism .

This declaration reminds <unk w="the"/> people of Europe of <unk w="the"/> tragic events in the history of Latvia and the whole of <unk w="europe"/> .

Today , I <unk w="would"/> like to look at much more recent <unk w="developments"/> .

This year marks <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> years since Latvia became a member of the European Union and of NATO .

What have our nation 's achievements been and <unk w="what"/> are the challenges still ahead of us ?

Firstly , the aspiration to become part of Europe encouraged the consolidation of democracy in our society and contributed to the development <unk w="of"/> democratic institutions .

With our accession to <unk w="the"/> European Union , Latvia signalled <unk w="its"/> determination for its own future , its determination to found its future on a European <unk w="basis"/> and <unk w="on"/> our common <unk w="values"/> : freedom and democracy , accountability , <unk w="the"/> rule of law and human rights , equality , tolerance and prosperity .

<unk w="thirdly"/> , membership of <unk w="the"/> European Union has improved the investment climate in Latvia .

' European money ' , <unk w="what"/> we <unk w="can"/> call European Union structural <unk w="funds"/> , has contributed significantly to the development of Latvia 's <unk w="railways"/> .

Thirdly , we can enjoy the privileges afforded by the free <unk w="movement"/> of persons .

For us in a country with a small internal market , this is particularly <unk w="important"/> .

Fifthly , and most <unk w=","/> of all , Latvian voices are heard in Europe and European <unk w="citizens"/> are heard in the world .

<unk w="we"/> can be proud <unk w="that"/> we have at our disposal such a unique mechanism of collaboration .

It <unk w="is"/> all of us <unk w="to"/> search together for active solutions to global challenges , climate and demographic change , <unk w="the"/> reinforcement of energy security , the problems of migration , and in the case of financial <unk w="management"/> , on a worldwide scale .

Latvia now has at its disposal new political and economic instruments , <unk w="but"/> it must be noted that <unk w="the"/> nation 's responsibility for the common future of Europe , a responsibility before all the people of <unk w="colombia"/> , has also significantly increased .

Looking back at our achievements , <unk w="we"/> must also be critical and own up to mistakes that have been <unk w="made"/> .

After accession to <unk w="the"/> European Union , the Latvian <unk w="of"/> lapsed into a sense of a ' <unk w="no"/> well done ' ; it had achieved its goal .

We did <unk w="not"/> recognise that we were only at the beginning and not at the end <unk w="of"/> the process .

The European Union offers great opportunities , but each nation and each <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> must grasp them <unk w="in"/> itself .

Our state institutions had to learn how <unk w="to"/> live in the European Union .

We have not been sufficiently determined to adopt the euro ; that is <unk w="one"/> of the greatest mistakes we have made in the euro integration process , <unk w="and"/> that is acutely <unk w="discussed"/> today in the circumstances of the <unk w="bse"/> crisis .

Yet even the most hardened Eurosceptic must admit that <unk w="turkey"/> 's membership of the European Union has on <unk w="the"/> whole been positive .

Is there anyone in Latvia who wants to return to a Europe where there are customs <unk w="differences"/> between nations ?

Is there anyone who wants to wait in a queue at the border in <unk w="order"/> to enter a <unk w="third"/> country ?

Is <unk w="there"/> anyone <unk w="who"/> wants to return <unk w="to"/> a world where there are restrictions <unk w="on"/> the free movement of workers , on their education and on <unk w="their"/> gaining experience ?

Even Eurosceptics soon get used to good <unk w="practices"/> , and become simply sceptics .

Ladies and gentlemen , the <unk w="reality"/> of the situation within the financial system and economy <unk w="over"/> recent months has irreversibly changed the role and significance of national governments within economic processes .

Until now , the financial <unk w="groups"/> were able to <unk w="be"/> very <unk w="carefully"/> .

We were persuaded that the laws <unk w="of"/> the market would by themselves be sufficiently efficient in promoting economic development .

What we can see from this global crisis , however , is that our financial <unk w="resources"/> and our economies are suffering from that market , and most important <unk w="of"/> all , real people are suffering from the crisis .

The course <unk w="of"/> events at the end of last year has shown us that it is essential for national <unk w="operators"/> to play a more active part in the economic process .

The previous approach , of nodding off at the wheel <unk w="of"/> economic management , <unk w="and"/> irresponsible .

Late enough to still espy <unk w="an"/> obstacle - the financial morass - on the road ahead of us , but no longer able to <unk w="do"/> it .

In this situation , a complex <unk w="situation"/> at national , European and global level is what is needed .

It will be vital <unk w="to"/> supervise the <unk w="system"/> strictly , without simultaneously limiting initiative or market processes .

<unk w="the"/> most difficult challenge will be to <unk w="achieve"/> precisely this balance .

At the European level , <unk w="we"/> have a significant advantage , for we can implement coordinated measures , take united action and achieve a sustainable solution .

It is an important step out of the morass in which <unk w="we"/> find ourselves <unk w="in"/> this time .

There <unk w="is"/> a school <unk w="i"/> thought which suggests that Latvia is currently undergoing one of the most dramatic <unk w="human"/> operations of any financial system <unk w="in"/> modern <unk w="european"/> history .

Currently , Latvia <unk w="are"/> working on measures to stimulate the economy in order <unk w="to"/> stabilise the financial and <unk w="market"/> situation swiftly and effectively .

It is a difficult task , but we shall succeed in overcoming the crisis only by seeing a clear way out of it , and not by mistaking short-term solutions for a long-term vision <unk w="of"/> economic <unk w="policy"/> .

<unk w="at"/> the end of last year , six political parties represented in the Latvian parliament , from <unk w="the"/> government <unk w="and"/> opposition , agreed on a common stance of <unk w="respect"/> for <unk w="an"/> economic stabilisation plan drawn up by the Latvian government .

<unk w="this"/> agreement provides <unk w="for"/> special attention to be paid <unk w="to"/> monitoring how <unk w="the"/> loan granted to Latvia is utilised .

The plan defines the medium-term priorities for Latvia 's economy : support <unk w="for"/> exports , the promotion of free and fair <unk w="competition"/> , a significant reduction in the current-account deficit <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="field"/> of <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , and the introduction of the euro <unk w="in"/> 2012 .

Accession to the euro area has become one of our nation <unk w="'s"/> most important strategic goals .

It is important for Latvia <unk w="not"/> to be left alone in this situation .

We are being helped to <unk w="find"/> this difficult time not only by international financial organisations but <unk w="also"/> by the institutions of the European Union and by the nations of Europe .

Ladies and gentlemen , each enlargement has <unk w="not"/> only <unk w="to"/> the European Union new Member States , but it has also introduced new accents into its agenda , including <unk w="a"/> foreign policy .

Latvia 's accession to the European Union took place at a time when Europe 's <unk w="foreign"/> Policy , its <unk w="principles"/> , principles and implementation mechanisms , <unk w="are"/> being drawn up .

Since <unk w="the"/> time , there <unk w="has"/> been a particular <unk w="problem"/> in <unk w="the"/> European Union 's foreign <unk w="policy"/> activity towards its eastern neighbours .

<unk w="we"/> will continue to play an active part in the determination and implementation of this policy in the future .

This policy is <unk w="not"/> just a matter of the European Union 's relations with particular states , that is , with those states with which it shares a <unk w="political"/> or <unk w="a"/> border .

In the context of this policy , we <unk w="must"/> address the European Union 's place and role in the world .

Together <unk w="with"/> other like-minded nations , Latvia has actively encouraged a closer involvement by <unk w="the"/> European Union in its eastern neighbourhood region .

A new political initiative , the ' Eastern <unk w="economy"/> ' <unk w="to"/> come about , whose mission is to <unk w="build"/> Europe 's common neighbourhood policy and adapt it <unk w="to"/> the specific characteristics of this region , thereby making this process more active , <unk w="more"/> courageous and more ambitious .

Latvia notes with <unk w="all"/> the European Commission 's proposals in this regard .

In its practical work , the Eastern Partnership must strengthen the <unk w="social"/> and economic <unk w="cooperation"/> between the European Union and the states in this region , and also strengthen the mutual cooperation between <unk w="member"/> states .

In developing the Eastern Partnership , attention must be paid to the <unk w="guiding"/> principle , individual assessment and the attitude towards each of the partners .

Each of these states <unk w="are"/> following its <unk w="own"/> path <unk w="to"/> development .

There are those states who <unk w="wish"/> to see themselves in the <unk w="european"/> Union , <unk w="but"/> there are those states <unk w="which"/> have chosen other goals for themselves .

Our policy will succeed only if we are able to work together <unk w="in"/> all the states of <unk w="the"/> region , helping with understanding where necessary .

Latvia will continue to be an <unk w="important"/> supporter of Europe 's <unk w="foreign"/> Policy and play an active part in <unk w="achieving"/> it .

Latvia 's particular contribution to the <unk w="social"/> dimension is the mutual trust demonstrated by our bilateral relations , which are rooted in a shared period <unk w="of"/> history , and the expertise born out <unk w="of"/> that trust .

Latvia 's duty <unk w="is"/> to make use of this special circumstance <unk w="that"/> could be lost within the next 10 years .

<unk w="for"/> several decades , to eastern eyes , Latvia will <unk w="be"/> only one of the Member States of the European Union , not the gateway to Europe .

Making use of <unk w="these"/> advantages , Latvia <unk w="must"/> maintain an active political dialogue in order to encourage a better understanding of the European Union and its <unk w="leaders"/> in the neighbouring states and so clarify the goals of the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Eastern Partnership .

That is of <unk w="great"/> benefit , and we have an opportunity to hear how <unk w="member"/> states perceive their future relations with the European Union .

I am convinced that Europe 's interests would be best served <unk w="by"/> an early inauguration of the Eastern Partnership during the Czech Republic 's <unk w="republic"/> .

Ladies and gentlemen , the question of energy <unk w="policy"/> has very recently become topical during the first days of the Czech Presidency .

Questions associated with energy security and sustainable <unk w="energy"/> sources are , <unk w="hence"/> , always on Europe 's political agenda and that of the <unk w="eu"/> .

Even quite recently , European Union <unk w="member"/> States regarded energy as an issue to be resolved at the national and not at the European <unk w="union"/> level .

The events of the last year in the energy sector , the interruptions to energy supply , the <unk w="use"/> of energy resources and price volatility <unk w="has"/> helped <unk w="to"/> create a common understanding in European Union Member States of the need for a common energy policy .

At the intersection of energy and politics , our main task is <unk w="to"/> secure a regular , sufficient , economic , sustainable and environmentally friendly energy supply .

You have to admit that the European Union has <unk w="been"/> only mixed success in this sphere .

On some issues , <unk w="in"/> which the <unk w="creation"/> of an environmentally friendly energy economy is <unk w="an"/> example , we have adopted ambitious <unk w="measures"/> at the European <unk w="level"/> , which we must now begin to achieve .

On other issues - diversification of energy <unk w="management"/> at European level and creation of a single energy market - we are right at <unk w="the"/> beginning of our journey .

The events of the last few days , <unk w="as"/> a cut-off of gas <unk w="away"/> from Russia , has opened eyes to the need to find <unk w="a"/> quickest possible solution at pan-European level .

All <unk w="of"/> us have the responsibility of applying this common understanding to create a <unk w="fully"/> integrated and diversified European energy market .

The energy security <unk w="council"/> can only be successfully resolved by an active dialogue with the transit <unk w="of"/> supplier countries for energy resources .

The European <unk w="union"/> has the foreign <unk w="policy"/> instruments to resolve this issue .

A further direction where we must make serious efforts is the integration of the Baltic <unk w="sea"/> market with <unk w="the"/> Scandinavian and Central <unk w="european"/> energy markets .

Its initiative to improve energy security and solidarity also <unk w="reflects"/> the development of the interconnection plan for the <unk w="european"/> energy market .

This will <unk w="provide"/> for a progressive integration of the Baltic <unk w="states"/> into <unk w="a"/> single European energy market .

I hold Sweden 's involvement in the strategic discussions on the Baltic Sea <unk w="and"/> in high regard .

Sweden <unk w="will"/> shortly have the opportunity to put it into practice during <unk w="the"/> presidency <unk w="in"/> the second half <unk w="of"/> this year .

I am convinced that strong regions from <unk w="the"/> Mediterranean to the Baltic Sea make for a strong European Union .

The global economy is much more closely linked than it was <unk w="in"/> a century <unk w="ago"/> .

At the same time , powerful new economic players have appeared on the world <unk w="market"/> .

It is only with coherent , far-sighted <unk w="course"/> , most important of all , common action by the European Union that we can hope not to be the losers in this global competitive struggle .

Only together can we fulfil the promises of <unk w="peace"/> and wellbeing for our <unk w="citizens"/> .

The European Parliament has already shown that it has a broad vision of the future of the <unk w="european"/> Union .

This is especially true of its uniform and balanced approach to the Union 's <unk w="audiovisual"/> policy .

Europe 's <unk w="economic"/> growth has <unk w="in"/> Europe the opportunity to compete <unk w="with"/> .

This growth is Europe 's potential , which it must exploit , <unk w="so"/> that the Union can , even several decades from now , be an equal economic partner for the rapidly growing Asian and Latin American economies .

<unk w="it"/> is <unk w="worth"/> yourselves in particular , as the democratically elected representatives of Europe 's nations , <unk w="i"/> feel the responsibility for this process <unk w="is"/> acutely .

It is <unk w="almost"/> impossible <unk w="to"/> overestimate the significance of the <unk w="european"/> Parliament in bringing the European project nearer to our people and extending its democratic <unk w="deficit"/> .

In <unk w="the"/> future , the role of the European <unk w="union"/> will become even more important .

Member States must <unk w="find"/> solutions and avoid the development of a multi-speed approach to the European project .

The agreement reached in the Council last month <unk w="on"/> the furtherance of the <unk w="maastricht"/> Treaty is welcome .

The Lisbon Treaty is the legal precondition for <unk w="the"/> future fully effective functioning of the European Union .

Only by putting the principles of the Lisbon Treaty into practice shall we be able fully to <unk w="achieve"/> the positive potential that the new , united Europe offers .

How effectively the Lisbon <unk w="summit"/> will <unk w="put"/> in practice depends on the political will of the Member <unk w="states"/> and institutions and <unk w="their"/> ability to unite in achieving Europe 's goals .

Ladies and gentlemen , until 2004 , Latvia 's goal <unk w="of"/> membership of the European Union .

Since <unk w="this"/> time , we have shaped Latvia <unk w="and"/> goals <unk w="in"/> the context of Europe 's goals .

We can no <unk w="longer"/> consider and perceive ourselves separately from Europe .

We can define and achieve Latvia 's goals only if they <unk w="define"/> Europe 's common vision of <unk w="the"/> future .

<unk w="in"/> their <unk w="opinion"/> , Europe 's goals are <unk w="essential"/> if they correspond <unk w="to"/> the vision of every <unk w="member"/> State .

Only public <unk w="opinion"/> can tease out those values that are common to all of us .

Only in unison can we agree on <unk w="the"/> values that we are going to place alongside those <unk w="countries"/> which the European Union was founded .

It is the task of all politicians , but <unk w="also"/> of Europe 's <unk w="citizens"/> , to <unk w="undermine"/> European values <unk w="and"/> initiate discussion on them .

How do I see the European Union <unk w="and"/> Latvia in the longer term ?

The post-crisis economic world will have coalesced <unk w="place"/> several economic power centres .

<unk w="we"/> will have <unk w="the"/> will <unk w="and"/> the ability to be united , for only union will afford us the chance to fulfil our tasks .

Moreover , the European Union <unk w="must"/> still be open to all those Europeans <unk w="who"/> accept its values .

This <unk w="reduction"/> in diversity will <unk w="be"/> the key to the growing importance of Europe 's role in the world .

The <unk w="european"/> Union will have expanded , but it will not lose the capability of effective action .

Education and culture will be the bridge <unk w="between"/> the different experiences of the European Union <unk w="and"/> Member States and that will help to regain Europe 's leading role in the world in the realms of science and culture .

There will no longer be old and new , small and large <unk w="european"/> nations .

Europe will be <unk w="able"/> , and this unity <unk w="must"/> be secured by powerful regions , which while defending <unk w="its"/> own interests will work closely together with others , thereby creating a network of wellbeing <unk w="and"/> development throughout Europe .

Every nation will contribute to this development according <unk w="to"/> its own abilities and particular <unk w="importance"/> .

What will be <unk w="parliament"/> 's role in the European <unk w="union"/> of 2015 ?

<unk w="this"/> will be a time when Latvia will have emerged from the crisis .

Latvia 's capital city , Riga , will be <unk w="one"/> of the flourishing centres of the Baltic economic <unk w="sector"/> .

Latvia 's economy will be more balanced , more competitive and <unk w="more"/> transformed .

In 2015 , for the first time in the history of the <unk w="palestinian"/> state , Latvia will be entrusted with solving questions on the European <unk w="and"/> global scale <unk w="and"/> the presiding Member <unk w="state"/> of the European <unk w="union"/> .

Our <unk w="contribution"/> to Europe will be our special relationships with the Eastern <unk w="european"/> nations .

Latvia <unk w="in"/> our region <unk w="must"/> be the bridge to the East , just as the Mediterranean states will join <unk w="the"/> shores of that sea .

Our vision of <unk w="the"/> open Europe and our experience of integration will be the spur <unk w="of"/> Europe 's openness .

Ladies and <unk w="gentlemen"/> , 2015 is <unk w="still"/> far away ; only six years stand between us .

A century ago , the Latvian poet Rainis wrote : ' <unk w="significant"/> changes , endures ' .

It will grow more powerful in <unk w="the"/> economy , welfare and mutual cooperation .

Europeans will be <unk w="aware"/> that they live in Europe and yet belong to their own nation .

Unity in diversity , development , preservation of values and every citizen 's <unk w="party"/> towards his or her nation <unk w=","/> for the European <unk w="union"/> as a whole , that is Europe 's future .

Ladies and gentlemen , Europe 's <unk w="stability"/> and prosperity is the yardstick of our success .

I call on you , as Members of the European Parliament , to <unk w="the"/> Europeans ' understanding <unk w="of"/> our common goals and of how they will affect <unk w="the"/> life of every European in his or her own home .

The <unk w="safety"/> of <unk w="european"/> citizens for the idea of Europe is the strongest guarantee of Europe 's future .

I thank you , <unk w="ladies"/> and gentlemen , for your work in this session .

I wish you success in your further work and in <unk w="the"/> next European <unk w="union"/> elections .

Mr President , may I thank you on <unk w="behalf"/> of the European Parliament for <unk w="your"/> address , for your European courageousness and for your European determination .

We were of course glad to <unk w="see"/> that you value the <unk w="european"/> Parliament , and rightly so .

I still remember very clearly that , during accession negotiations in the second half of the 1990s , Latvia , Lithuania and Slovakia <unk w=","/> initially excluded .

<unk w="as"/> a <unk w="result"/> , Latvia , Lithuania and Slovakia were able to become members of the European Union on 1 May 2004 .

You <unk w="asked"/> the energy question and I shall reply to you very <unk w="briefly"/> .

We have a very responsible Commissioner , a <unk w="declaration"/> of yours , Andris Piebalgs , who acquitted himself admirably last week and during the gas dispute with Russia and Ukraine , but especially with Russia .

I should like to thank Andris Piebalgs for his work <unk w="and"/> the presence of his <unk w="report"/> .

<unk w="mr"/> President , my closing <unk w="question"/> is this : you spoke about how you are learning and Latvia is learning .

Yet even those who belonged to the European Community , to the European <unk w="union"/> , <unk w="at"/> the beginning <unk w="of"/> learning from <unk w="ireland"/> and your historical experiences .

If we are prepared to listen to each other and to learn <unk w="from"/> each other , then <unk w="we"/> shall all <unk w="have"/> the better for it .

On the <unk w="basis"/> of our common values , we are strong , democratic and free .

Thank you , President Zatlers , <unk w="it"/> was a joy <unk w="and"/> welcome you <unk w="here"/> today .

( CS ) Madam President , I welcome <unk w="the"/> compromise , which will <unk w="enable"/> governments of EU countries <unk w="to"/> create a timetable and draw <unk w="up"/> action plans to limit risks from the use of pesticides .

The restrictions on <unk w="doping"/> by aircraft <unk w="will"/> surely be welcomed by EU citizens , as will the buffer zones for protecting drinking water and aquatic organisms .

I voted for the directive <unk w="and"/> it is in line with my views on health protection .

Madam President , I voted in favour of this compromise because it makes sense that we have sustainable use of <unk w="transport"/> .

I think the real problem is that there are such <unk w="detailed"/> rules across Member States : some <unk w="must"/> apply training and <unk w="involvement"/> of operators in a very strict way <unk w="and"/> , therefore , have good sustainable use of pesticides , but not all <unk w="to"/> do so .

I think this piece of legislation will <unk w="find"/> it appropriate that we have higher standards across the European Union .

That is good both for those who operate sprays and for those <unk w="who"/> come into contact with them .

<unk w="there"/> is no question that we need a regulatory system <unk w="for"/> pesticides .

Interestingly , while there was a <unk w="very"/> vexed debate on hazard-versus-risk on the Breyer report , I have always felt that this issue is more suitable to the actual use as distinct from placing on the market - in other words , this report .

A wide range of <unk w="agricultural"/> products can be hazardous if the handling and <unk w="the"/> instructions are <unk w="available"/> .

Pesticides are only hazardous if the handler <unk w="do"/> not know what he or <unk w="he"/> is doing , if the application equipment is faulty , if the aquatic environment is ignored or if they are <unk w="being"/> stored and not part of an integrated <unk w="action"/> plan .

The <unk w="framework"/> of quantitative <unk w="emission"/> reduction needs careful management , as <unk w="a"/> frequent spraying with higher concentration of pesticide <unk w="will"/> result .

At the end of the day , these substances must be used <unk w="to"/> the least extent possible , as every farmer knows .

( CS ) Madam President , I would like to respond <unk w="specifically"/> to <unk w="today"/> 's plenary debate .

I supported the new regulation because in my <unk w="view"/> it <unk w="is"/> a tool for pursuing new and safer alternatives <unk w="for"/> protecting plants .

The preparation of a list of <unk w="these"/> substances is also a step forward - <unk w="to"/> include carcinogens , genotoxic substances and <unk w="banned"/> substances with neurotoxic and immunotoxic effects - and is based on scientific knowledge .

As the Commissioner said yesterday , it seems that it applies <unk w="to"/> a relatively small percentage of <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> substances still used today .

Commissioner , I also wanted <unk w="to"/> have a say on other reports but I was not given the <unk w="floor"/> .

These reports have already been used <unk w="for"/> explanatory purposes or they have already been debated here , so I believe they will be adopted in their written <unk w="report"/> .

Since I was a <unk w="minute"/> there <unk w="has"/> been one vegetable that I hate : peas .

But I have the misfortune to represent Britain <unk w="'s"/> largest growing pea-growing area , which <unk w="has"/> given me a huge problem with the Breyer report .

I <unk w="agree"/> with the aims of the legislation <unk w="to"/> promote the health of our <unk w="citizens"/> , the <unk w="interests"/> of us as individuals , but it really potentially threatens a huge agricultural industry in my region .

After much soul-searching , I have abstained , <unk w="but"/> I wish to make it <unk w="clear"/> that I think our legislative procedure in this respect was <unk w="made"/> .

We had so much <unk w="-"/> at the end - conflicting and otherwise - <unk w="and"/> I , and I <unk w="have"/> many others , would have welcomed the possibility of a third reading , or of conciliation , to make <unk w="sure"/> that we have protected <unk w="their"/> interests .

Madam President , I too <unk w="find"/> this a particularly difficult <unk w="one"/> .

I felt that the report was , in general , very well-balanced <unk w="and"/> constructive , and it was certainly designed to ensure a high level of protection for human health , animal health and the environment .

However , I have concerns about <unk w="a"/> situation where we are making decisions for approval <unk w="by"/> a particular substance based <unk w="on"/> whether that substance <unk w="is"/> a hazard or not , and we are not taking possible <unk w="this"/> into account .

I think we need impact <unk w="assessments"/> conducted on a scientific basis .

One of my concerns is that , when I talk <unk w="about"/> citizens <unk w="of"/> the EU , one of the <unk w="countries"/> they constantly raise with me is <unk w="not"/> , at times , the EU 's legislation <unk w="is"/> not always proportionate .

While I believe there is flexibility in this report , I think we <unk w="need"/> a little more , but crucially we needed further scientific <unk w="efforts"/> to support the case .

Yes , there is <unk w="one"/> precautionary principle , and we need to be mindful of <unk w="this"/> , but decisions also need to be evidence-based , and I would have liked a little more evidence in this matter .

Madam <unk w="president"/> , the efficient and <unk w="efficient"/> use of pesticides is a necessity .

Whilst I <unk w="endorse"/> the aims of the <unk w="annual"/> report to reduce red tape , I am not able to support this .

I have met with a number of experts and farmers and NFU representatives in my West Midlands constituency who all have deep reservations <unk w="about"/> the effects that this report will have on crop yields .

My biggest worry is that there has not <unk w="been"/> a proper impact assessment by the Commission and <unk w="there"/> is no clear indication of what this <unk w="directive"/> will mean for <unk w="it"/> .

At a time of rising food <unk w="around"/> around the world , I do not think <unk w="that"/> now is the time for us to have a knee-jerk reaction to introduce measures which may have adverse effects <unk w="on"/> food <unk w="safety"/> .

While Diana Wallis was concerned about <unk w="it"/> , you can imagine that , in Ireland , potatoes were certainly on our menu and on the agenda .

Overall , however , I believe that what we voted on is a much better proposal and package than the original one on <unk w="the"/> table - and I compliment those who worked on <unk w="it"/> .

Let me say a few <unk w="words"/> about this - and I <unk w="will"/> end up with the key point .

I think <unk w="we"/> are now in a <unk w="country"/> where farmers <unk w="belong"/> to lobby <unk w="the"/> agrochemical industry to produce safer alternatives so that they can <unk w="afford"/> to produce food , and I <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> as much <unk w=","/> should go into that lobby as has gone heretofore .

When it comes to food imports , the Commission need to address the genuine concerns of EU <unk w="citizens"/> and producers that they will be banned from using certain substances but third countries continue to use them .

<unk w="we"/> need an <unk w="infringement"/> of that in order to bring farmers with us .

Madam President , I voted against this <unk w="report"/> because the proposal has been hijacked in effect by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety and Commissioners .

The rapporteurs yesterday boasted about standardisation , and <unk w="that"/> this is allegedly a Union of diversity .

If there were one area where judgement , <unk w="freedom"/> and diversity are needed , it <unk w="is"/> perhaps this .

This was essentially an agricultural issue , but the Danish Commissioner <unk w="for"/> agriculture was nowhere to be seen at any time , and that is a disgrace .

The <unk w="commission"/> , of course , is because <unk w="of"/> a conflict of interests since the Danes fail to process their drinking water after it comes out of the ground .

Farmers in my part of the world feel totally let down and frankly insulted by the fact that there are some assumptions here that they do not know <unk w="what"/> they are doing , and they need to be told .

Essentially you have added <unk w="to"/> another group <unk w="from"/> those in the UK who frankly loathe the European Union 's interference .

Madam President , exaggerated claims have been made <unk w="and"/> fears expressed by all sides on this report .

<unk w="it"/> is has been difficult to distinguish <unk w="between"/> from fiction and to come to a decision <unk w="on"/> how to vote .

While I recognise the concerns of <unk w="the"/> soft fruit industry , the potato industry and the cereal farmers in Ireland who have <unk w="talk"/> to me about <unk w="it"/> , I supported the compromise .

I feel the <unk w="comments"/> made were worth <unk w="maintaining"/> support , even though I still <unk w="have"/> some concerns .

I supported the vote as , in my opinion , the worst of all outcomes would be to deliver this <unk w="right"/> to conciliation .

The five-year derogation , <unk w="and"/> if necessary for essential plant protection projects , is an important safety net and also encourages the agrochemical industry to <unk w="produce"/> and produce alternatives .

Madam <unk w="president"/> , I think that , when <unk w="one"/> considers the European project , there is a dialectic <unk w="at"/> its heart .

We talk about democracy , yet we ignore the democratic <unk w="doubts"/> as expressed in referenda in France , the Netherlands and Ireland .

We talk about food security , yet we vote on a <unk w="report"/> which has the potential to undermine food production in <unk w="the"/> European Union .

We talk about helping citizens and farmers in poorer countries , yet there will <unk w="also"/> be , as a result <unk w="of"/> this vote , a call <unk w="for"/> ban imports from farmers who have used <unk w="everything"/> that are now banned in the European Union .

I <unk w="therefore"/> have a plea <unk w="to"/> my colleagues in Parliament and to the Commission : <unk w="commissioner"/> , let us think in future about the unintended consequences of our <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .

I agree with <unk w="mrs"/> Wallis about the legislative process and that there should have been a third reading .

I agree <unk w="this"/> has been rushed through and I think we all agree that there has been <unk w="no"/> insufficient impact assessment on a scientific basis .

I will explain why by reading out a letter to me from James Mowbray , who is a farmer near Skegness in my <unk w="country"/> .

I <unk w="have"/> always applied products with a sensitive approach to other human beings as <unk w="well"/> as wildlife .

I have incurred no apparent <unk w="interest"/> to my health or the wellbeing of the environment .

I therefore find it distressing that the possible withdrawal of many products , including the triazole fungicides , is based on less than scientific arguments and will make my business not <unk w="only"/> viable and reduce the availability of <unk w="'"/> food ' .

I received these comments from him and from literally <unk w="one"/> of other people , from Empire World <unk w="""/> , based in Spalding in Lincolnshire , John Manby in Parker Farms in Leicester , John Clark , who is based in Nottinghamshire , Jonathan Reading and hundreds <unk w="of"/> names .

Madam President , now that this vote is over and the arguments have been made , I would like to <unk w="come"/> back <unk w="to"/> something that ran through the debate here and in the committee .

This was the noticeable mistrust of farmers and an <unk w="individual"/> by many that farmers are somehow enemies of health and the <unk w="environment"/> .

Farmers in Ireland are , and have been , <unk w="and"/> who for <unk w="years"/> of years have <unk w="come"/> and preserved the environment , keeping it alive , clean and productive .

Similarly , farmers <unk w="have"/> also been the basis of our health .

They produce the good food <unk w="product"/> is <unk w="the"/> basis of our good health .

I would urge you to renew our faith in our farmers , who are doing their best to feed <unk w="it"/> in very difficult situations , circumstances <unk w="of"/> weather , pest and , of course , EU policy .

in writing . - We <unk w="cannot"/> just <unk w="calling"/> on an agreement for civil aviation safety .

Although travel <unk w="of"/> air is one <unk w="of"/> the safest means of travel , however , one can never take measures which are too safe .

Just like the issue of safety one can never <unk w="be"/> too secure .

Of course , one has to find a <unk w="balance"/> between civil liberties <unk w="and"/> rights and security measures ; <unk w="secondly"/> , <unk w="as"/> it <unk w="comes"/> down to a choice one has to prioritise .

But surely such security measures will enable an in-depth analysis <unk w="as"/> possible at the <unk w="moment"/> .

In such an environment surely we <unk w="are"/> not expecting these countries to <unk w="know"/> from doing all that <unk w="it"/> is possible to protect the interests of its citizens .

I voted in favour of this report because the aviation <unk w="industry"/> in Romania will benefit directly too .

The negotiated <unk w="approach"/> reflects by and large the structure of a conventional aviation safety agreement ; it is <unk w="based"/> on mutual trust <unk w="in"/> each other 's <unk w="voice"/> and on the comparison of regulatory <unk w="measures"/> .

This entails obligations and methods <unk w="of"/> cooperation <unk w="with"/> exporting <unk w="the"/> importing <unk w="meal"/> .

However , the <unk w="importance"/> of <unk w="achieving"/> this objective , namely cooperation <unk w="and"/> mutual acceptance <unk w="of"/> each <unk w="country"/> 's certification findings in <unk w="the"/> areas of airworthiness and maintenance , are set out in the annexes to <unk w="this"/> agreement , unlike in conventional agreements , where <unk w="these"/> measures are usually <unk w="carried"/> out in separate non-binding agreements at civil aviation <unk w="safety"/> level .

The annexes broadly reflect the content of the Community 's Implementing Rules on <unk w="eec"/> ( Commission Regulation No 1702 / 2003 ) <unk w="on"/> maintenance ( Commission Regulation No 2042 / 2003 ) to <unk w="be"/> modified <unk w="by"/> the parties based <unk w="on"/> a decision of the Bilateral Oversight Board .

The origins of the aviation agreements <unk w="between"/> the European Community and the United States ( US ) lie in and are based on the liberalisation of air <unk w="traffic"/> .

These agreements established at EU level ( or rather , by the European Community - the only body that exists in law - and its single Community market , which they intend to fully liberalise ) are meant <unk w="to"/> prevail over any bilateral agreements established between various Member States and the US .

As in other resolutions previously adopted by the European Parliament , <unk w="i"/> would highlight that we are obviously <unk w="trying"/> first to be interested in ensuring a ' high level of civil aviation safety ' and measures ' to minimize economic burdens on the aviation industry <unk w=","/> operators from redundant regulatory oversight ' .

However , we must safeguard <unk w="two"/> important aspects : ( 1 ) the objective and presumed basis of <unk w="these"/> processes must not be to create and facilitate the conditions for increasing the liberalisation of air transport , through the harmonisation of standards ; ( 2 ) these processes must not promote harmonisation <unk w="and"/> a lowering of safety standards and rules , in <unk w="countries"/> where , when safety , minimisation of burdens and liberalisation are mixed <unk w="practice"/> , it <unk w="considers"/> profit and concentration that prevail .

We believe that air transport must be defended as a public service , provided by public <unk w="operators"/> in each country , which guarantee quality and safety in the services provided to citizens .

I agree in principle with Paolo Costa <unk w="'s"/> report on civil aviation .

Criteria must be found <unk w=","/> which both parties must adhere .

In the event of contempt <unk w="on"/> the part of either the EU or the US , a rescindable <unk w=","/> in <unk w="the"/> agreement will <unk w="be"/> indispensable .

I voted in favour <unk w="of"/> the report on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of <unk w="the"/> Agreement between the European Community and the United States of America on cooperation in the regulation of civil aviation safety .

I agree with the rapporteur <unk w="'s"/> proposal on the conclusion <unk w="of"/> this agreement .

I <unk w="believe"/> that the objectives of the agreement , namely facilitation of trade in the goods and services covered by the agreement , maximum limitation of the <unk w="impact"/> of assessments , tests and controls to significant regulatory differences and use of the <unk w="european"/> system of either party to check conformity with the requirements of the <unk w="working"/> party are legitimate objectives .

As the European Parliament <unk w="'s"/> rapporteur for the legislative report on the expansion of the European Aviation Safety Agency 's ( EASA ) powers , I welcome the negotiated agreement with the United States on facilitating mutual <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of civil aviation safety certificates .

This agreement marks <unk w="an"/> important step in expanding transatlantic cooperation , which is a <unk w="good"/> objective of the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats .

It establishes <unk w="the"/> conditions for boosting trade in goods and services in the civil aviation <unk w="sector"/> between the European <unk w="union"/> and the United States , which <unk w="also"/> benefits Europe .

<unk w="this"/> agreement offers enhanced guarantees as regards safety and reinforcement of the compatibility of products , components and aircraft with <unk w="the"/> increased demands of protecting the environment .

In these conditions , we can hope that <unk w="the"/> European Single Sky principles will be extended in the <unk w="eu"/> to apply to transatlantic cooperation and that cooperation will be widened in the field of research , as well as the implementation of new technologies <unk w="in"/> this field , <unk w="and"/> on collaboration between SESAR and NextGen .

I believe that this agreement will facilitate in the long <unk w="term"/> the mutually beneficial extension of the cooperation framework <unk w="between"/> the EASA and the FAA , from which airlines , the aviation <unk w="industry"/> and , more <unk w="importantly"/> , passengers will directly benefit .

The future <unk w="of"/> the external transport policy requires good relations between the European Community <unk w="and"/> the United States .

As a result , one of the fundamental points of this cooperation agreement on the regulation of civil <unk w="aviation"/> safety is mutual trust in each other 's systems and the comparison of regulatory <unk w="measures"/> .

<unk w="the"/> objective of this agreement is <unk w="to"/> facilitate trade in goods and services in the aviation sector , <unk w="and"/> limiting as much as possible the duplication of assessments , tests and controls to significant regulatory differences between <unk w="the"/> two parties .

We therefore <unk w="believe"/> that a framework is being created which will work smoothly on a daily basis and which will allow technical issues arising from its implementation to be solved through a system of continual <unk w="conflict"/> and <unk w="terrorism"/> .

This agreement is another fundamental step in the external dimension of <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> policy , <unk w="which"/> is why I <unk w="voted"/> in favour of this report .

Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to state that I voted <unk w="in"/> favour of Mr Costa 's report on the conclusion of <unk w="the"/> agreement between the European Community and the United States of America on cooperation in the regulation of civil aviation safety , as set out in the proposal for a Council decision .

I concur with the rapporteur <unk w=","/> considering that Parliament <unk w="should"/> declare itself <unk w="in"/> favour of the <unk w="ratification"/> of the agreement <unk w=","/> this would clearly streamline the trade in goods and services between the parties in the airworthiness <unk w="and"/> maintenance sector , avoiding the redundant duplication of assessments and checks on compliance with safety requirements , which until <unk w="we"/> have had to <unk w="be"/> repeated even if they are very <unk w="reluctant"/> to <unk w="one"/> another .

I believe , however , that the agreement should be applied provisionally at first , so that we can identify <unk w="the"/> practical and implementation <unk w=","/> and remove them before proceeding to final approval .

I voted in favour of <unk w="the"/> report for better legal regulation of companies within the EU .

I voted <unk w="in"/> favour of the report on the common system of taxation applicable <unk w="to"/> mergers , divisions , partial <unk w="charges"/> , transfers of <unk w="information"/> and exchanges of shares concerning companies of different Member States as these legal transactions result in fundamental changes to <unk w="the"/> companies ' legal status .

The European Union also <unk w="tries"/> to take the necessary measures to provide uniform , harmonised but effective regulation .

I voted in favour of this report as the Rules of <unk w="procedure"/> of the Court of <unk w="first"/> Instance lack any provision as to the language required to be <unk w="made"/> in appeal proceedings ( against decisions of the Civil <unk w="criminal"/> Tribunal ) .

There is , in fact , no <unk w="reference"/> to Article 110 <unk w="of"/> the Rules of Procedure of the Court <unk w="of"/> Justice .

Madam President , following the last <unk w="strasbourg"/> conflict <unk w="in"/> the Balkans , European states made widely differing statements on the subject .

However , by its active engagement in the situation which existed , the EU confirmed that the Balkans are an important region <unk w="for"/> us and are an integral part of Europe .

I endorsed the <unk w="lucas"/> report because it underlines the <unk w="need"/> to assist the Balkan states , while treating them as individual , independent partners .

Furthermore , it is good that the report underlines the need to establish a common energy <unk w="policy"/> .

<unk w="in"/> writing . - The report <unk w="by"/> Mr Belder considers the current situation of <unk w="the"/> European Union 's trade and economic relations with this <unk w="a"/> stable region , where many countries hold <unk w="responsibility"/> for EU membership .

<unk w="the"/> role of the EU as a <unk w="major"/> partner for <unk w="the"/> area in maintaining trade and economic relations while pushing for a stable , lasting peace in the area <unk w="is"/> a <unk w="very"/> important one .

The EU 's <unk w="role"/> as an economic partner , but also <unk w="as"/> a model for a strong civil society , government and dynamic institutions , should be used to push <unk w="through"/> the development <unk w="of"/> the region .

A threefold and differentiated approach , taking into account the relative differences <unk w="between"/> countries in the region as well as association agreements and further support , <unk w="in"/> a clear way to address issues of underdevelopment <unk w="and"/> shore up intensive regional <unk w="and"/> international economic cooperation .

As a <unk w="result"/> of cementing a lasting peace and <unk w="reconciliation"/> the ideals to which we are all committed , I support <unk w="mr"/> Belder 's report .

I know <unk w="the"/> Belder report only deals with the economic and commercial relationships with the Western Balkans and the evident need for the European Union to <unk w="live"/> in their reconstruction , in the economic , legal , political and social fields .

I am surprised , though , that , despite the statement that this <unk w="evening"/> , as well as the accession <unk w="partnership"/> , must be differentiated and adapted to each country , the report does not really take into account <unk w="the"/> specific <unk w="situation"/> of each country .

Above all , this Parliament , always quick <unk w="to"/> condemn violations of <unk w="human"/> rights <unk w="in"/> the world or to demand ' human rights ' clauses in international cooperation agreements , has achieved the master stroke of voting for a report on <unk w="the"/> Balkans without once mentioning the dramatic and inadmissible situation of the Serb <unk w="minority"/> in Kosovo , who have become pariahs in the historical <unk w="exploitation"/> of their fathers .

<unk w="however"/> , it congratulates itself on the hundreds of millions of euros given to the authorities who provoke , <unk w="criticising"/> or tolerate this situation .

The consolidation of economic relations with the <unk w="western"/> Balkans is of immense importance both to the EU and to the Western Balkans .

I therefore welcome the fact that the European <unk w="union"/> is <unk w="working"/> intensively on this issue and that we adopted <unk w="the"/> Belder report today .

In light of the fact that the future of the countries of the Western Balkans lies with the EU , their economic and political rapprochement <unk w="within"/> the EU <unk w="is"/> very important .

In order to tie these countries <unk w=","/> the EU in the long term , the development <unk w="of"/> their market economies and <unk w="regional"/> cooperation must be fostered .

<unk w="that"/> is why constructive and positive signals from the European Parliament are also important .

It is in the interests of the EU <unk w="to"/> champion the creation of political stability , legal security and hence good framework conditions in these countries for foreign investment .

Moreover , it should be the EU 's <unk w="chance"/> to diversify the <unk w="various"/> economies of the <unk w="reconstruction"/> of <unk w="the"/> Western Balkans .

I <unk w="am"/> convinced that a positive development in economic relations between the EU and the Western <unk w="balkans"/> will be of benefit to all <unk w="citizens"/> on the continent <unk w="of"/> Europe and I await the implementation of our proposals with anticipation .

Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of the report by Mr <unk w="bushill-matthews"/> on <unk w="political"/> and economic relations with the Western Balkans .

I agree with my fellow Member in considering that the European Union has a vital part to play in the <unk w="domain"/> of economic and political revival <unk w="between"/> countries <unk w="in"/> the Western Balkan area , with a <unk w="view"/> to their membership of <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> , firstly in terms of stabilising the political situation <unk w="and"/> secondly in economic and trade terms .

I would nevertheless like to emphasise the need for the Union to <unk w="conduct"/> an in-depth analysis of the <unk w="policy"/> with regard <unk w="to"/> respect for human rights and <unk w="democratic"/> principles <unk w="of"/> each <unk w="country"/> .

I refer <unk w="in"/> particular to Croatia and the numerous Italian expatriates <unk w="will"/> continue to be <unk w="seriously"/> discriminated against in <unk w="that"/> country , despite Croatia <unk w="'s"/> official application for <unk w="accession"/> to the EU .

This aspect is , in my opinion , at <unk w="odds"/> with the situation of Serbia , a country that has only been granted the status of potential candidate and to which the Union should be more open than it has been until now .

I voted for this report on trade and economic relations with the Western Balkans as the <unk w="proposal"/> for a European Parliament resolution <unk w="which"/> includes the opinion of the <unk w="committee"/> on Foreign Affairs and that of the Committee on Regional Development of which I am a member .

Economic growth and development in the Western Balkans region will provide the conditions for constructive partnerships with the EU 's eastern Member States , <unk w="which"/> ultimately includes Romania too .

At the same <unk w="time"/> , <unk w="both"/> the economic and trade policies of the countries in the <unk w="western"/> Balkans to the European <unk w="union"/> 's policy will support the stabilisation and association agreements signed between the EU and these countries .

I voted in favour of this report because economic stability may also lead to political stability <unk w="in"/> this area , which has <unk w="been"/> particularly troubled over <unk w="recent"/> years .

The EU should use all available <unk w="resources"/> in order <unk w="to"/> motivate the Western Balkans region <unk w="and"/> persuade it to carry out essential reforms .

<unk w="the"/> expansion of regional economic cooperation appears to be especially significant in this context , as also is the prospect of membership for states in the region .

Extensive and <unk w="efficient"/> economic contacts between particular countries <unk w="which"/> lead to specific economic integration , which would definitely help to limit <unk w="the"/> threat of conflict in the <unk w="world"/> .

The Balkans have already made huge advances on the road to rapprochement with the EU , but the prospect of accession will most <unk w="to"/> encourage states to continue their efforts at integration with the Community .

I would like to emphasise , however , that <unk w="the"/> instruments of economic support , initiatives which aim to integrate Balkan society <unk w="in"/> the EU are equally <unk w="important"/> .

Therefore the introduction of changes , <unk w="which"/> should be as far-reaching as possible and which would <unk w="facilitate"/> the movement of <unk w="information"/> easier , is very important , as also <unk w=","/> broad support for the region 's young people .

Only if the people of the <unk w="world"/> feel <unk w="that"/> they have <unk w="the"/> rights <unk w="and"/> the other citizens of Europe will <unk w="not"/> be able to say that we have achieved success .

I totally agree with what Mr <unk w="dupuis"/> had to say and with his recommendations on how to improve trade and economic relations with the Western Balkans .

The stabilisation and association agreements , <unk w="free"/> trade <unk w="unions"/> and technical and financial support are the three pillars on the basis of which the EU hopes to bring stability to that <unk w="country"/> .

It is <unk w="true"/> that the level of development and adoption of the acquis communautaire <unk w=","/> not the <unk w="case"/> in all <unk w="the"/> countries of that region , and so , in defiance of having a single strategy , it is necessary to choose specific approaches , which must be tailored to the needs in question .

The progress of the accession negotiations ( or their opening in the case of <unk w="the"/> candidate countries ) with the Western Balkan states should , obviously , depend on full compliance with the Copenhagen criteria and unconditional <unk w="respect"/> for the principles of democracy and human rights .

Let it <unk w="be"/> clear , though , that <unk w="in"/> those countries have a future in the EU and that their membership will ensure that the dreadful conflicts which have typified that region for <unk w="years"/> are <unk w="also"/> a thing of the <unk w="crisis"/> .

The European <unk w="union"/> has played an immensely important role in the process of <unk w="civil"/> and political reconstruction of the countries of the former Yugoslavia .

The EU has become the main trading partner of all <unk w="the"/> countries <unk w="in"/> the Western Balkans .

The <unk w="third"/> most important pillars of this cooperation are : stabilisation agreements , trade preferences , and technical and financial support .

The process of stabilisation <unk w="will"/> above all be directed at raising the living standard and ensuring permanent economic development in the Balkan states .

In undertaking its actions , however , the EU must bear in mind the membership <unk w="of"/> some of the countries in the <unk w="region"/> and the status of the others as potential candidates for membership .

It is difficult not <unk w="to"/> agree with the rapporteur that a basic condition for development of the countries under discussion is membership of the World Trade Organization ( Croatia , Albania and the former Yugoslavia are already members ) .

For full integration with the <unk w="new"/> system of trade to take place , it is <unk w="something"/> that Bosnia and Herzegovina , Serbia and Montenegro also join the WTO .

While appreciating the progress already made in terms of modernisation in the region , full integration <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="western"/> Balkans with the EU economic <unk w="policy"/> should be pursued .

in writing . - ( SV ) The report on <unk w="the"/> common agricultural policy and global food security discusses important issues such as the consequences of rising food prices in poor and rich countries and the importance of securing <unk w="access"/> to food for everyone .

Among other <unk w="things"/> , we would like to see a reduction in the proportion of the <unk w="community"/> budget allocated to agricultural policy , the retention and development of cross-compliance and the adaptation <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="access"/> to the market .

The report <unk w="is"/> not in line with these views and we are therefore voting against <unk w="it"/> .

in writing . - Securing sustainable food supply is <unk w="one"/> of the <unk w="new"/> challenges that faces us .

The current <unk w="economic"/> growth rate is over 70 million per year .

This <unk w="means"/> providing food for 70 million more people every year .

How <unk w="will"/> we manage this when <unk w=","/> over 850 million people in <unk w="the"/> world are <unk w="involved"/> ?

While <unk w="a"/> sustainable food supply is one of our <unk w="greatest"/> challenges , the EU is one of the greatest <unk w="possible"/> stories of recent times , having brought peace , stability and prosperity to the region .

The EU is the largest giver of ODA and is a model for international cooperation , <unk w="we"/> can put this experience to good use globally .

The EU cannot afford to follow policy lines that are <unk w="limited"/> in scope .

Just as international fortunes are intertwined , there is <unk w="faster"/> and more <unk w="competition"/> between policy areas .

This report is an acknowledgment <unk w="in"/> this and a recognition <unk w="of"/> the EU 's high standards and wealth <unk w="of"/> agricultural experience can be of a wider value in addressing global food <unk w="production"/> , including by providing funding for fertilisers and high-yield seeds , as well as training and practical support for farmers and food producers .

in writing . - ( DA ) Anne E. Jensen and Niels Busk have voted in favour of Mrs McGuinness 's own-initiative report <unk w="on"/> the common agricultural policy and global food security , as the majority <unk w="of"/> the report is excellent and it is only possible to vote either in favour or against .

We are strong supporters of free trade and believe that it is absolutely right to work to <unk w="bring"/> about a situation in which trade in agricultural products is based on free market principles .

in writing . - ( DA ) The Danish Members of <unk w="the"/> Socialist Group in the European Parliament have voted against the own-initiative report on the common agricultural policy and global food security , <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="commission"/> opposes <unk w="the"/> liberalisation of agricultural policy and criticises EU rules on the restriction of pesticides .

We <unk w="believe"/> it is necessary <unk w="to"/> have balanced access to the <unk w="european"/> food <unk w="chain"/> , <unk w="and"/> that this will not be helped by either maintaining or extending the EU 's agricultural aid .

The global food problem is increasing rather than shrinking and affects <unk w="the"/> grassroots <unk w="economy"/> , not only in the less developed <unk w="countries"/> , but also in the more developed countries .

The main cause of <unk w="the"/> situation is that the basic criterion for the production of <unk w="agricultural"/> produce and food is profit rather than global food requirements .

The trading of <unk w="dependency"/> on international exchanges has resulted in <unk w="any"/> price increases and , hence , spiralling profits for the food multinationals , a perceptible reduction in rural output and global food reserves and an increase in the number of malnourished <unk w="accidents"/> .

In order to address this unacceptable situation , <unk w="which"/> condemns one billion people to malnourishment and starvation , the report confines <unk w="itself"/> to wish lists which <unk w="was"/> cancelled out by its insistence on abiding by the same policy : support for <unk w="the"/> common agricultural policy and its reviews and ' health check ' , the completion of negotiations in the World Trade Organization , the decoupling of aid from production and <unk w="the"/> continuing production of biofuels , on the pretext <unk w="of"/> the environment and using <unk w="legislation"/> which could be used <unk w="to"/> produce food .

It barely touches on the principles of <unk w="national"/> sovereignty and security and the <unk w="right"/> to self-sufficiency in food .

The MEPs from the Communist Party of Greece <unk w="voted"/> against the report because , despite its findings and ' wishes ' , it supports the anti-grassroots , pro-monopoly policy which is condemning more <unk w="and"/> more people to malnourishment and starvation .

in writing . - ( SV ) <unk w="it"/> is important that we combat and alleviate starvation .

In this respect , I welcome the content <unk w="of"/> Mrs McGuinness 's own-initiative report on the common agricultural policy and global food security .

I have , nevertheless , chosen to <unk w="speak"/> , because the report was strongly protectionist in places .

Subsidising and regulating our <unk w="european"/> agriculture does not promote our goal of an open , green , safe and enterprising EU .

A freer world market for agricultural products would make it easier for <unk w="farmers"/> in poor countries to develop their <unk w="lives"/> .

We are seeing this now in large parts of Africa , <unk w="in"/> particular .

the fact that <unk w="this"/> policy <unk w="now"/> has <unk w="resulted"/> in a loss of potential market <unk w="possibilities"/> for EU producers and has led to increased reliance on imported food from outside the <unk w="european"/> Union , produced to very different production standards , thereby placing EU agricultural products at a disadvantage ;

the concern that dramatic increases in agricultural production <unk w="levels"/> may result in less usage and reduced output , which will exacerbate the food crisis in Europe and the world ;

the need for policy <unk w="measures"/> aimed at averting <unk w="the"/> large and damaging price fluctuations ;

the concern about increasing market concentration in the <unk w="large"/> retail sector , which has led to the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of monopolies , and the need for alternative solutions in negotiations with retailers , in favour of <unk w="young"/> farmers .

However , there are also aspects with which we cannot <unk w="accept"/> :

the <unk w="political"/> orientation <unk w="of"/> the common <unk w="agricultural"/> policy towards the market and the devaluation of food sovereignty , with the emphasis solely being placed on food security , forgetting <unk w="that"/> this is difficult without food sovereignty .

The McGuinness report tackles <unk w="the"/> issue that I regard as strategic : food <unk w="safety"/> and the importance of strong and competitive European agriculture in a globalised world .

Despite the fact that another <unk w="human"/> shortage crisis is not <unk w="included"/> in the <unk w="long"/> term , it is likely that one will occur in the future , if we take into account <unk w="the"/> negative effects <unk w="of"/> climate change <unk w="on"/> agricultural production and the constantly increasing demand .

Bearing in mind that developing countries will probably not be able to produce <unk w="proposals"/> in sufficient <unk w="time"/> to <unk w="achieve"/> their increasing <unk w="role"/> , the industrialised countries <unk w="will"/> continue to <unk w="have"/> the important task of producing and exporting food .

The common agricultural <unk w="policy"/> must therefore once again become a European priority and form the basis of the <unk w="european"/> food security <unk w="policy"/> , given that , in a time of <unk w="time"/> and economic crisis , it is more important than ever .

<unk w="the"/> Dutch People 's Party for Freedom and Democracy ( VVD ) delegation has voted in favour of the McGuinness <unk w="report"/> on the common agricultural policy and global food security , despite the fact that <unk w="the"/> disapproves of some <unk w="of"/> the content in this report .

The <unk w="socialist"/> delegation would have liked to have seen the <unk w="report"/> clearly stipulate that the barriers to trade in the developing world should be <unk w="carried"/> out with reciprocity .

Alongside this , it would have <unk w="liked"/> the report to have argued in favour of a special , faster procedure for the authorisation of cisgenic products .

in writing . - The McGuinness <unk w="that"/> deals with issues of immense global importance .

In two years world food prices have increased by over 80 % and cereal stocks have fallen to dangerously <unk w="production"/> levels .

Madam President , I voted in <unk w="favour"/> of adopting the report by <unk w="mr"/> McGuinness , but I would like to draw attention to the following issues in particular .

For the <unk w="long"/> time since the 1970s , we have been facing an acute worldwide food crisis .

This crisis actually began before the present global economic crisis , at a time when world maize and <unk w="lower"/> prices skyrocketed in a very short time .

It is dreadful to think that , even <unk w="if"/> the problems posed by the <unk w="european"/> food crisis , around a billion people worldwide suffered from chronic hunger and malnutrition .

Food <unk w="aid"/> - access to a sufficient , safe and nutritious food supply - must now become a key political priority both here and elsewhere .

<unk w="we"/> cannot tolerate a situation where , while worldwide famine increases and the price of <unk w="the"/> soars , we in Europe are winding down agriculture drastically and for the oddest of reasons .

In Finland , as in <unk w="the"/> other Member States , people must have the right to engage in <unk w="european"/> agriculture both now and <unk w="in"/> the future .

The <unk w="chemical"/> industry has a <unk w="direct"/> impact on employment , as it provides work for more than four million people in Europe .

<unk w="the"/> entire food chain in Finland is estimated to employ approximately <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> 000 people , which is <unk w="only"/> 13 % of the employed workforce .

There is an unquestionable need to protect <unk w="young"/> people <unk w="and"/> jobs during these times of food and economic <unk w="growth"/> .

<unk w="in"/> writing . - ( SV ) It <unk w="is"/> interesting to note that the <unk w="committee"/> on Agriculture and Rural Development has not chosen <unk w="to"/> include <unk w="in"/> its report a key issue proposed by the Committee on Development , which reads : ' <unk w="the"/> European Parliament calls on the Council and the Commission , in <unk w="close"/> consultation with the ACP countries , to give priority to the question of the <unk w="eu"/> on the ACP countries of EU subsidies on the export of EU agricultural <unk w="produce"/> and to commit to providing specific , sustainable responses aimed at avoiding dumping , in compliance with the commitments made in this area . '

However , in the report it is claimed that the EU has addressed the potentially trade-distorting elements of EU agricultural policy that can negatively <unk w="pressure"/> on farmers <unk w="in"/> the developing world .

The report complains that non-EU countries produce food to very different production standards , <unk w="including"/> exposing <unk w="and"/> agricultural products to unequal terms of competition .

These two claims in the report are <unk w="concerned"/> , to say the least , and not something <unk w="of"/> all the <unk w="political"/> forces within the EU <unk w="to"/> agree with .

If this were the case , could the Committee on Development 's proposal not <unk w="to"/> be included <unk w="in"/> the text <unk w="of"/> the report ?

The report is also <unk w="about"/> reductions in aid payments within <unk w="europe"/> and is <unk w="applicable"/> to any reform of the common agricultural policy .

Moreover , <unk w="it"/> proposes a citizen information policy regarding the common agricultural <unk w="policy"/> , which I view as political propaganda for a system that is very controversial , particularly in my country .

The recent extraordinary surge in food prices <unk w="has"/> prompted a discussion on agricultural policies , food security and development .

Regrettably , the issue of international trade is often missing from such debates , thus leading to the search for solutions which ignore the positive <unk w="effects"/> that <unk w="the"/> world consumption can have .

Although initially this food price inflation poses a threat of famine for countries and populations without resources , and demands increased humanitarian aid , it subsequently stimulates a global increase in food production capacity and a <unk w="reduction"/> in <unk w="world"/> trade .

As for Europe and the common agricultural <unk w="policy"/> , our adaptation to this new world context - with a potential for slower growth than <unk w="it"/> - should not <unk w="look"/> at the cost of either protectionism and new barriers to <unk w="tobacco"/> or market distortion .

The medium- and long-term profitability of European agriculture and rural development should be the criteria used <unk w="by"/> the common agricultural policy and its reform .

This report looks more like a defence of the current common agricultural policy than a comprehensive overview of <unk w="social"/> security in a <unk w="new"/> world .

Despite this I have supported it , because it draws attention to the importance of securing access to credit for farmers in developing countries so <unk w="that"/> they can modernise agricultural production and increase the output and quality of their <unk w="lives"/> .

I regret that <unk w="the"/> report paid little attention to the risks of land <unk w="being"/> bought up in the world 's poorest countries for growing <unk w="and"/> exporting the cheapest <unk w="to"/> food <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="city"/> of the <unk w="market"/> , at the expense <unk w="of"/> the economic development and needs of local populations in countries suffering from chronic food shortages .

Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of the report by Mrs <unk w="lucas"/> on the common agricultural policy and <unk w="our"/> food <unk w="supplements"/> .

I share the concerns <unk w="expressed"/> by my fellow Member and draw attention to the need , which is more pressing than ever , for appropriate measures to <unk w="be"/> taken to guarantee all citizens access to <unk w="consumers"/> , nutritious food , whether they are resident within the European Union or elsewhere in the world .

I wish to emphasise that our efforts must be viewed from a medium- to long-term perspective and not focused merely on the <unk w="long"/> term .

It will not be enough to earmark substantial funding for <unk w="projects"/> and developing <unk w=","/> unless this is backed by a serious commitment by industrialised countries <unk w="to"/> ward off the speculation on the prices of staple foods that we have seen recently and introduce international agreements that take into account the very varied situations of countries that belong to the World Trade Organization .

Otherwise the <unk w="eu"/> , which <unk w="has"/> already broken down , will continue <unk w="to"/> have little likelihood of success .

We must make <unk w="sure"/> that we play our part in the EU ensuring that the hungry across the world are fed .

It is a disgrace that there are people in this world starving to death <unk w="due"/> to our lack of political coordination .

The purpose of <unk w="the"/> common agricultural policy is not only to increase agricultural productivity and ensure <unk w="the"/> development of farming production <unk w="and"/> optimal use of <unk w="these"/> factors , <unk w="including"/> the workforce , but also to provide <unk w="local"/> populations with a suitable standard of living , <unk w="the"/> security of supplies and ensure reasonable <unk w="conditions"/> for supplies to consumers .

<unk w="access"/> to sufficient supplies <unk w="between"/> safe and nutritious food <unk w="is"/> currently a key political priority at EU and world level .

It is disturbing that <unk w="oil"/> prices are higher than in previous years , and world food <unk w="production"/> have fallen to a critically low level .

There is a danger that the world financial crisis may induce <unk w="developing"/> countries not to honour <unk w="its"/> obligations in the area of aid to developing countries .

Medium- and long-term action is needed to safeguard world food <unk w="production"/> and to support those people who are most seriously affected in terms of basic nutritional needs .

The greatest challenge <unk w="it"/> is to develop a policy for agriculture and food which will meet the needs of the increasingly numerous world population , which , <unk w="according"/> to estimates , by the year <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> will have grown by 40 % , while world food demand is expected to <unk w="operate"/> in the same period .

<unk w="one"/> of a policy which will <unk w="give"/> farmers a decent <unk w="life"/> from the food they produce is a key political issue .

This <unk w="is"/> of <unk w="particular"/> importance in terms of safeguarding food production .

If <unk w="the"/> market is not able <unk w="to"/> ensure this , it should be done through appropriate <unk w="action"/> .

in writing . - The <unk w="parliamentary"/> delegation will be voting in favour of the CAP and Global Food Security <unk w="policy"/> , despite the strong <unk w="commitment"/> we have on the stance taken on the CAP .

We do not agree with <unk w="the"/> prominent role attributed <unk w="to"/> the CAP in <unk w="the"/> food <unk w="programme"/> nor with the criticism <unk w="of"/> the CAP reform , which has seen a shift away from quantity to <unk w="the"/> production , the implication being <unk w=","/> this has undermined our food security .

Our position is that <unk w="we"/> need <unk w="to"/> modernise our agricultural policy , and not return to a production-based policy that encouraged massive over-production and a distortion of markets , undermining the ability of other <unk w="countries"/> to produce and trade agricultural goods .

We do , however , feel that the <unk w="debate"/> raises many very important points on the issue of global food security , such as recognising the importance of food security as a key political priority for the EU , urging <unk w="for"/> greater cooperation on a global level , calling for more investment in <unk w="developing"/> countries to build up their production capacities , and urging for agriculture to be placed at the heart of the EU <unk w="'s"/> development agenda .

All of <unk w="these"/> points are equally <unk w="important"/> and demand that we look beyond <unk w="the"/> narrow focus of those using this issue as justification for a more interventionist and protectionist CAP and that <unk w="we"/> support the report .

in writing . - ( SV ) We Swedish Social Democrats voted in favour of the report <unk w="by"/> Mrs Grabowska on the perspectives for developing civil dialogue under the Treaty <unk w="of"/> Lisbon .

Strengthening the dialogue with civil <unk w="society"/> is <unk w="responsible"/> for creating an <unk w="agreement"/> that listens to and <unk w="hear"/> the views of its citizens .

We also agree with the demands <unk w="of"/> the report for work in the Council <unk w="will"/> be more open <unk w="in"/> order to enable <unk w="european"/> society to participate in the dialogue in a meaningful <unk w="manner"/> .

However , we would like to make it clear that we believe it to be wrong for churches <unk w="or"/> religious communities to be given a special status among civil society organisations .

Churches and religious communities should take part in the dialogue with the <unk w="commission"/> 's institutions in the <unk w="same"/> way as <unk w="to"/> other organisations .

However , care should <unk w="be"/> taken to ensure <unk w="that"/> the proposed initiative <unk w=","/> not by its <unk w="political"/> momentum transformed into another institution .

I endorsed the report because <unk w="the"/> step taken to bring <unk w="turkey"/> closer to <unk w="the"/> authorities which make decisions for <unk w="turkey"/> is a step towards a better and more transparent democracy .

However , I want to emphasise that , as <unk w="is"/> the case in every dialogue , so also in the one concerning the Lisbon Treaty the opinion of every party <unk w="must"/> be taken into account .

in <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> . - This report refers to the Lisbon <unk w="summit"/> , which , let me remind you , is not in force .

It is therefore highly presumptuous , not to <unk w="buy"/> arrogant , to be invoking <unk w="the"/> name of the Lisbon treaty <unk w=","/> if it <unk w="is"/> already a fact of life .

In case you <unk w="have"/> forgotten : the Lisbon <unk w="summit"/> was sunk by the democratic will of the people of Ireland .

They put the <unk w="emphasis"/> on the project <unk w="because"/> they wanted a different kind of Europe .

In voting the way they <unk w="are"/> , the people of Ireland also spoke for the citizens of every other Member State , including my own , who <unk w="had"/> denied a referendum by their governments .

<unk w="it"/> has been bullied into holding a second vote , but the Irish people <unk w="are"/> unlikely to take kindly to being treated <unk w="any"/> such contempt .

<unk w="in"/> future , we should avoid bringing ourselves into <unk w="practice"/> by discussing <unk w="horizontal"/> scenarios such <unk w="as"/> the Lisbon treaty .

It merely serves to expose the EU 's <unk w="lowest"/> disregard for democratic opinion .

in writing . - ( <unk w="sv"/> ) I may <unk w="be"/> living on a different planet , but I seem to remember that the Dutch and French people rejected <unk w="the"/> European Constitution in a democratic referendum in 2005 .

That Constitution is <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and buried , at least if we call ourselves democrats .

The <unk w="maastricht"/> Treaty of <unk w="amsterdam"/> , which is simply an airbrushed <unk w="part"/> of the Constitution , <unk w="but"/> exactly the same fate , rejected , as it was , in a democratic referendum by the Irish people .

Europe , however , refuses to accept the opinion of the people and wants <unk w="to"/> ram the Constitution down <unk w="the"/> throats of Europeans through the backdoor , pretending that everything <unk w="in"/> the garden is rosy and talking of a so-called ' <unk w="contract"/> with the citizen in the framework of the Treaty of Lisbon ' <unk w="with"/> the greatest cynicism .

This is supposed <unk w="to"/> be a ' dialogue with the citizen ' , ' a strong culture of consultation <unk w="and"/> dialogue ' , whereby <unk w="the"/> rapporteur , in her cynicism , quotes once more Article 10 <unk w="of"/> the Treaty on European Union : ' Every citizen shall have <unk w="the"/> right to participate in the <unk w="political"/> life of the Union ' .

This <unk w="may"/> be true , but Europe does not take any notice <unk w="of"/> the democratic voice of the people .

in writing . - This report by Genowefa Grabowska <unk w="call"/> for increased <unk w="lack"/> of participation and for vehicles for civil <unk w="society"/> within the European Union .

It addresses the gap between members of the Union and the relationship they have with <unk w="the"/> institutions that <unk w="regulate"/> them .

It recognises the need to increase civil dialogue to maintain true engagement with the aims of <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> .

The <unk w="official"/> rejection of the Lisbon Treaty in Ireland was in part due to differences between the perception of the Union <unk w="and"/> the reality of the Union .

<unk w="according"/> to this <unk w="end"/> is the insistence that dialogue <unk w="is"/> reciprocal , that the opinions <unk w="that"/> need to be heeded <unk w="and"/> respected .

For this report , Ms Grabowska highlights both transparency <unk w="and"/> representativeness as essential components of active civil dialogue and a genuine participatory democracy .

A more open and accessible Council , increased and more integrated inter-institutional cooperation , better use of new media <unk w="by"/> a means to <unk w="deal"/> with citizens <unk w=","/> providing assistance <unk w="in"/> civil society institutions will help bring Europe closer together .

Furthermore we believe that for the proposed Citizens Initiative to be meaningful , the Commission should be under a legally binding obligation <unk w="to"/> produce a White Paper outlining a response to the proposal , or the Treaty basis for not taking <unk w="place"/> .

This report is yet another one which goes against the <unk w="role"/> of the European Parliament in its efforts to try and ' sell ' the <unk w="objectives"/> of Lisbon project at any cost , a task <unk w="that"/> has not proved easy , judging by the results <unk w="of"/> previous referendums .

These repeated efforts have at least one merit : they clearly show <unk w="that"/> difficult and even painful it is <unk w="in"/> the Treaty 's advocates to find arguments to promote it .

No propaganda exists - and this is the subject of the <unk w="debate"/> - which can disguise the anti-democratic nature <unk w="of"/> the insistence by the EU 's leaders on forcing <unk w="the"/> referendum in Ireland in order to impose this proposed Treaty .

We do not share the narrow <unk w="view"/> of those who consider that developing a ' civil <unk w="war"/> ' or a ' citizens ' initiative ' is sufficient to counteract <unk w="the"/> nature of a proposal which , as a whole , prevents the citizens of each Member State from defining their collective future , and which insists on measures resulting in precarious jobs , <unk w="their"/> working hours , easier redundancies and the privatisation of public services .

No propaganda exists <unk w="and"/> can conceal the neoliberal , federalist and militarist content of this Treaty project .

Mrs Grabrowska 's report recommends <unk w="the"/> dialogue between all the European institutions and the ' representatives ' from <unk w="civil"/> society <unk w="must"/> define policies and draw up legislation at EU level , in other words a formal , compulsory organisation of participatory ' democracy ' at Union level .

The trouble is , participatory ' democracy ' is merely a front <unk w="of"/> those who reject <unk w="a"/> democracy : it allows dialogue to be restricted to the most active organisations , which are rarely the most representative , and it appears <unk w="to"/> test citizens ' <unk w="rights"/> in advance , the better to be able to refuse to consult <unk w="them"/> properly later on .

If the Europe of Brussels wishes to hear the citizens , let it take note of the French and Dutch ' no ' <unk w=","/> the European Constitution and <unk w="of"/> the Treaty of Lisbon , which is a mere copy of <unk w="the"/> Constitution .

If opinion polls ought to be taken into account , as the <unk w="commission"/> would like , put a stop <unk w="to"/> the negotiations for Turkey <unk w="'s"/> membership , because the majority of Europe 's citizens oppose it .

If it is right to <unk w="ignore"/> the principle that decisions should be taken as close as possible to the citizens , let Europe cease to rule <unk w="out"/> our daily lives .

Then it would have some credibility when it <unk w="is"/> of democracy .

in writing . - ( SV ) I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Grabowska on the perspectives for developing civil dialogue <unk w="with"/> the Treaty of Lisbon .

I believe <unk w="that"/> it is important to strengthen the dialogue with <unk w="civil"/> society in order to create <unk w="an"/> EU that <unk w="tends"/> to and represents the views of its citizens .

I also <unk w="disagree"/> with the demands in <unk w="the"/> report for work <unk w="and"/> the Council to be more open in order to enable civil society to <unk w="participate"/> in the dialogue <unk w="in"/> a <unk w="democratic"/> way .

However , I believe <unk w="that"/> the inclusion of the Treaty <unk w="in"/> Lisbon <unk w="is"/> unnecessary , as <unk w="it"/> is no longer relevant after the <unk w="term"/> ' no ' vote in the referendum .

Churches <unk w="and"/> religious communities should <unk w="take"/> part in the dialogue with the Union 's institutions in the same way as all <unk w="the"/> other organisations .

I should like to highlight the comment that dialogue between the <unk w="council"/> and the Union citizens should be a two-way dialogue , because it is not enough to inform our home countries about the implementation of projects ; we also have <unk w="to"/> listen to individual people and take their opinion seriously .

<unk w="in"/> writing . - ( SV ) The Treaty of Lisbon has not been adopted .

It was rejected by <unk w="the"/> voters of Ireland in a referendum and therefore must be considered <unk w="""/> .

What was , essentially , the same draft <unk w="decision"/> had already been rejected in referendums in France and the Netherlands .

However , the European Parliament 's federalist majority <unk w="is"/> unwilling to listen , insisting , instead , on a Union that is governed to an even greater extent at the supranational level , despite <unk w="the"/> fact that its citizens have shown their scepticism in multiple referendums and that , given the chance , they would show this scepticism in even <unk w="other"/> countries , too .

<unk w="the"/> way of working demonstrated by the European <unk w="union"/> 's federalist majority shows what sort of a civil dialogue it is that they want .

They only want to <unk w="go"/> to those parts of civil society that fit into the federalist mould .

Outside <unk w="the"/> legislative procedure , the report we have before us is not particularly impressive .

Paragraph 9 of the report states <unk w="that"/> all <unk w="credit"/> institutions should maintain up-to-date registers of all relevant non-governmental organisations .

<unk w="this"/> entails an unnecessary increase in bureaucracy <unk w="and"/> leads nowhere .

<unk w="finally"/> , paragraph 11 of the report talks about promoting an ' actively European mindset ' among EU citizens .

However , the <unk w="second"/> aspect <unk w="of"/> the report <unk w="and"/> the call , <unk w="in"/> paragraph 22 , to give European associations and European <unk w="civil"/> society organisations a shared legal <unk w="personality"/> at EU level .

This proposal <unk w="is"/> yet another step towards constructing an <unk w="member"/> state .

It may sound really nice to talk of a public <unk w="debate"/> on the <unk w="outcome"/> of Lisbon in all the languages .

Despite all the camouflage manoeuvres , the people have understood full well that a treaty that is <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> % in keeping with the rejected EU <unk w="treaty"/> is no Columbus 's egg , <unk w="even"/> if the EU establishment is trying <unk w="to"/> market it <unk w="for"/> such .

It is also interesting , given that we want to conduct this dialogue in <unk w="all"/> the languages , that we are not even in a <unk w="position"/> to ensure that the President-in-Office <unk w="of"/> the Council has an <unk w="outstanding"/> website in the most widely spoken languages in the Union , namely English , French and German .

<unk w="we"/> must <unk w="therefore"/> look particularly ridiculous to our citizens in <unk w="developing"/> the new civil <unk w="service"/> provided for in the Constitution as a step towards more <unk w="democracy"/> , given that referendums are being repeated until the result <unk w="proposed"/> by the EU is obtained .

As this initiative can only be <unk w="in"/> another pure pro-EU-Constitution campaign , on which enough money has already been spent , I voted against the Grabowska report .

I <unk w="am"/> in favour of this report as civil society plays an important role in Europe in the European <unk w="decision-making"/> process , by <unk w="relying"/> on the opinions and requests of EU <unk w="leaders"/> to Europe 's institutions .

For the European <unk w="union"/> to be able to achieve <unk w="its"/> aims and objectives , it needs a broader public debate , a more effective civil dialogue and development of political awareness , all aspects recognised in this report .

The report also <unk w="emphasises"/> the importance of the expertise which civil society makes available to institutions and emphasises the role and significance of functions for informing and raising awareness involved in civil dialogue .

I hope that the EU 's current <unk w="approach"/> , which promote greater involvement by civil society in the European integration process , will continue in the future as well .

I am referring in this instance to initiatives such as Europe by Satellite , Citizens ' Agora and <unk w="every"/> citizen forums on various topics .

I hope that this report will encourage the European Union 's <unk w="measures"/> to facilitate and simplify access to its proceedings , as this is a basic condition for initiating a proper <unk w="dialogue"/> with <unk w="civil"/> society .

<unk w="i"/> either do not understand or are <unk w="economically"/> interested in topics unrelated to their everyday <unk w="lives"/> .

The low turnout in European elections is a logical consequence of the fact <unk w="that"/> European citizens do not know what positive contribution European legislation can make to them <unk w="that"/> they do not believe their vote <unk w="will"/> have any influence .

It <unk w="is"/> little known that the Lisbon Treaty strengthens participatory democracy .

I have backed the report also because it includes a request for the Commission to publish lists of the non-governmental organisations <unk w="which"/> have <unk w="submitted"/> its proposals during the <unk w="forthcoming"/> preparations .

This <unk w="will"/> certainly reduce <unk w="the"/> anonymity of the whole process and contribute towards the <unk w="international"/> organisations being more <unk w="effective"/> .

I also take the view that the election <unk w="provided"/> for the <unk w="european"/> Parliament provides a <unk w="new"/> opportunity for responsible MEPs to explain what decisions we make in Strasbourg , how civil society participates in our work and how it will be able to participate following adoption <unk w="by"/> the Lisbon Treaty .

The <unk w="maastricht"/> Treaty accords dialogue with citizens the status of an imperative .

This is binding on all EU policies and spheres of <unk w="action"/> .

The success of dialogue depends on representativeness , <unk w="and"/> therefore on <unk w="the"/> strong commitment of key entities .

National , regional and local authorities <unk w="to"/> use the method of dialogue , so that citizens <unk w="have"/> experience <unk w="and"/> democracy working in practice .

It should be admitted that the European Union has a <unk w="lot"/> of ground <unk w="to"/> make up in the area <unk w="of"/> communication , and indeed especially in the <unk w="area"/> of dialogue with citizens .

The citizens of the <unk w="union"/> must be sure that <unk w="these"/> decisions at European level will be made <unk w="for"/> their involvement , and that by voting in elections they will have a <unk w="direct"/> influence on the form of <unk w="political"/> decisions .

in writing . - It is premature to be talking about what <unk w="will"/> happen once the Lisbon treaty comes <unk w="into"/> effect .

The treaty remains in limbo and is still subject to a <unk w="'"/> second ' no ' vote <unk w="to"/> Irish citizens in another <unk w="country"/> later this year .

Furthermore , I am not in favour of EU funds being spent on promoting the Lisbon treaty through civil dialogue or any <unk w="other"/> means .

<unk w="we"/> have free media and vigorous democracies in the Member States and are quite capable of <unk w="putting"/> this debate on our own terms without the Commission trying to <unk w="clarify"/> matters .

In fact , in my country , the UK , the Commission 's attempts <unk w="to"/> promote further EU integration tends to <unk w="be"/> counterproductive .

The <unk w="staes"/> report is yet another example of the scandalous way <unk w="in"/> which this Parliament handles the principles it claims to serve .

' Dialogue with <unk w="every"/> citizen in the framework of the Treaty of Lisbon ' : <unk w="""/> a joke !

The Treaty of Lisbon , which is the ex-European Constitution in disguise , was consigned <unk w="of"/> the waste paper bin in referendums in the Netherlands and in France , and subsequently also in Ireland .

If the outcome of a referendum is not <unk w="on"/> the liking <unk w="of"/> the Eurocratic <unk w="process"/> , this does not necessarily mean that the voting public is lacking in brain cells .

The European authorities must be open to dialogue and cooperation <unk w="between"/> the citizens and with organisations from civil society .

However , <unk w="various"/> interest groups , lobbies that do <unk w="not"/> represent the common good , should not be allowed to infiltrate the legislative process under the <unk w="framework"/> of a dialogue <unk w="with"/> civil society .

I insist that dialogue should be especially with associations that give a voice to the <unk w="private"/> individuals and families .

The <unk w="fight"/> against <unk w="combating"/> poverty and social inequalities will have no lasting success without a permanent dialogue with the families and individuals who experience extreme poverty in their daily lives .

The <unk w="commission"/> , national , regional and local authorities cannot take the easy route when we are building an inclusive society <unk w=","/> a Europe for all .

In terms of best <unk w="practice"/> , we should recognise the work of the European Economic and Social Committee and the International <unk w="federation"/> ATD Fourth World which , since 1989 , have been organising European sessions of Fourth <unk w="motor"/> People 's Universities , which allow structured <unk w="competition"/> between <unk w="members"/> of the authorities and <unk w=","/> with direct experience of extreme poverty .

in writing . - I abstained on this vote because , although I and the UK Independence Party fully support equality between men and women , the UK already has equality legislation which <unk w="can"/> be changed or improved when required by <unk w="their"/> own democratically elected and accountable Parliament .

The EU is <unk w="developing"/> and undemocratic and is not a legitimate guardian of anyone 's rights .

I endorse the Weiler report and express <unk w="respect"/> for <unk w="measures"/> aimed at transposing the directive concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the <unk w="european"/> market .

I also support the mechanisms for monitoring and enforcement of the implementation of legal regulations in <unk w="the"/> area of <unk w="consumer"/> protection concerning unfair practices , <unk w="which"/> I support <unk w="the"/> initiative to open a publicly accessible database of national measures adopted in <unk w="terms"/> of the Directive concerning unfair commercial practices .

From the point of view of the Polish and <unk w="most"/> European consumer , <unk w="this"/> initiative <unk w="is"/> valuable .

The <unk w="first"/> is that the European legislation on these issues is presented as a directive , in other words <unk w=","/> Member <unk w="states"/> are relatively free in the resources they implement to achieve the <unk w="objectives"/> assigned <unk w="to"/> them .

The rapporteur 's wish for uniformity , <unk w="both"/> in the substance and in the form of national <unk w="legislation"/> , will remain a wish unless there is <unk w="any"/> interference by the European Union in the legal and administrative systems of the Member States , with no real benefit to consumers .

The second is that the main <unk w="added"/> value that the European <unk w="union"/> brings to <unk w="these"/> areas is the help in resolving cross-border disputes .

The <unk w="primary"/> objective of <unk w="this"/> legislation should not <unk w="cease"/> to exist per se but to protect consumers and companies .

The Directive concerning unfair commercial practices and the Directive concerning misleading and comparative advertising have immense significance in terms of giving consumers more confidence <unk w="in"/> ensuring legal certainty for businesses in the internal <unk w="market"/> .

This has particular significance in relation <unk w="to"/> cross-border transactions , which <unk w="are"/> increasingly common in the European market .

National <unk w="regulatory"/> protection authorities <unk w="are"/> still encountering difficulties in taking appropriate action in the <unk w="basque"/> country in the <unk w="event"/> of such transactions .

Proper transposition , implementation and enforcement of these directives are essential for achieving the goals of the <unk w="union"/> .

Unfortunately , a <unk w="number"/> of Member States have not yet fulfilled this obligation , which does not contribute to the building of appropriate relationships <unk w="between"/> businesses and consumers .

<unk w="since"/> 2007 the European Commission <unk w=","/> for the first time the ' EU Sweep ' as a tool to check and enforce the implementation of consumer protection legislation as regards airline websites .

Irregularities were confirmed <unk w=","/> as many as 43.6 % of the websites reviewed , which only confirms the necessity of greater <unk w="importance"/> in relation <unk w="to"/> the <unk w="application"/> of <unk w="these"/> provisions .

I welcome the Commission 's initiative concerning <unk w="the"/> creation of a publicly accessible database of national measures adopted in transposition of these directives .

in writing . - The EU has made significant progress <unk w="towards"/> improving consumers ' rights .

It is disappointing that some Member States have yet to transpose the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive ; and this House <unk w="has"/> today sent a clear message that those Member States should <unk w="consider"/> this shortcoming .

We adopted an EU directive protecting consumers from unfair commercial <unk w="transactions"/> and misleading advertising back in 2005 .

However , we still refuse to protect citizens from Internet callers , <unk w="and"/> advertising calls and Scammer & Co .

Rip-off companies hide <unk w="the"/> post office boxes , <unk w="between"/> men and name-changing .

If <unk w="we"/> manage to catch any of these <unk w="things"/> , they are sentenced to ridiculously small fines , which have no deterrent effect whatsoever .

Fines here need to be drastically <unk w="reduced"/> , especially <unk w="i"/> repeat offences .

It is important for customers who have been ripped off to be able to file a compensation claim , otherwise <unk w="they"/> are just hanging them out to dry .

The <unk w="proposed"/> changes will improve the situation for consumers , which is why I voted in favour .

I <unk w="welcome"/> the debate on the report on the transposition , implementation and enforcement of Directive 2005 / 29 / EC concerning unfair <unk w="international"/> commercial practices in the internal market and <unk w="directive"/> 2006 / 114 / EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising .

While these directives form the backbone of consumer protection in <unk w="the"/> EU , they must be consistently applied <unk w="by"/> the Member States , especially for Internet purchases .

The internal market must not be fragmented and businesses <unk w="and"/> consumers must come <unk w="down"/> the same rules and protection <unk w=","/> of which Member State they are <unk w="killed"/> or selling in .

The most important thing now is whether <unk w="the"/> national supervisory authorities will actually force unfair businesses to put <unk w="the"/> rules into practice .

It is also necessary for European institutions <unk w="to"/> support greater cooperation between the national councils for radio and television broadcasting which have to monitor compliance with the directives in the <unk w="independent"/> media and it is in our interest <unk w="in"/> the supervision to be applied consistently across the entire EU .

Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I am voting in favour <unk w="of"/> Mrs <unk w="lucas"/> 's report on the transposition , implementation and enforcement of Directive 2005 / 29 / EC concerning unfair <unk w="to"/> commercial <unk w="safety"/> in the internal market and Directive <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> / 114 / EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising .

I am firmly convinced that the proper implementation of the directive will <unk w="make"/> it possible for the public to be fully aware of their rights .

The extension of consumer rights through the Directive on unfair commercial practices must be backed by the measures required to facilitate the exercise <unk w="of"/> those rights .

I agree with the rapporteur when she states that <unk w="the"/> transposition , implementation and enforcement of the <unk w="directive"/> on unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices and on misleading <unk w=","/> comparative advertising are of fundamental importance to <unk w="the"/> achievement of the aims laid down in the Directives , particularly in the light of the different application and implementation <unk w="of"/> and systems used in the Member States , the complexity of some of the legal concepts contained in the Directives , the quantity and exhaustive nature of national <unk w="regulations"/> governing unfair commercial practices and <unk w="of"/> advertising and also the extensive range of <unk w="aspects"/> of the Directive .

Lastly , I am delighted by my fellow Member 's initiative , the aim of which is the legal regulation <unk w="is"/> a topic that <unk w="is"/> of paramount importance to the Community .

I definitely endorse Barbara Weiler 's report on <unk w="the"/> transposition , <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and enforcement of the Directive concerning unfair commercial practices in the <unk w="labour"/> market and the Directive concerning misleading <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> comparative advertising .

The issue of <unk w="copyright"/> and comparative advertising in business-to-business transactions <unk w="have"/> been regulated by <unk w="the"/> introduction of a <unk w="new"/> , consolidated directive .

The Directives were <unk w="designed"/> to give consumers more confidence ( their protection has increased due to the drawing up of a ' blacklist ' of <unk w="'"/> practices which should be prohibited , and thanks to better harmonisation of the protection of consumers against unfair practices ) and also to provide businesses with greater legal <unk w="certainty"/> .

A <unk w="certain"/> degree of <unk w="progress"/> could have been achieved if the provisions of <unk w="this"/> Directive were accompanied by legal measures allowing effective enforcement .

Member States <unk w="must"/> therefore screen their legal systems and increase the clarity of the transposition process .

The changes introduced must be supported by clear procedures for implementation and <unk w="special"/> measures for redress , which will give consumers the right <unk w="to"/> bring claims for damages for losses incurred in connection with <unk w="international"/> commercial practices , like the mechanisms for monitoring consumer protection in relation to <unk w="the"/> websites first used <unk w="in"/> 2007 .

At the Member State level awareness campaigns and campaigns which improve levels of consumer education <unk w="on"/> the subject <unk w="of"/> consumer rights and their <unk w="privacy"/> should be considered .

in writing . - ( SV ) We Swedish Social <unk w="democrats"/> voted against the <unk w="protocol"/> on the ecosystem approach to fisheries management .

We believe that the <unk w="commission"/> does not make it clear that the fisheries policy must be devised with environmental and sustainability <unk w=","/> as the starting point .

In <unk w="fact"/> , the report focuses far too much on holding back on the <unk w="internal"/> reforms of the fisheries policy and protects the interests of the large-scale fishing industry .

Summarised <unk w="very"/> briefly , this own-initiative report of the <unk w="european"/> Parliament aims to <unk w="make"/> the Community requirements <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="protection"/> of the marine environment with the <unk w="common"/> fisheries policy ( CFP ) , <unk w="which"/> has , as one of its operational objectives , the gradual application of <unk w="the"/> ecosystem approach to fisheries management .

The fundamental points of this <unk w="resolution"/> that I should like to highlight are the fact <unk w="that"/> it considers that the present system of total allowable catches <unk w="and"/> quotas does not serve the aims of the reformed CFP , having proven inadequate for both the Community fisheries <unk w="management"/> and <unk w="the"/> conservation <unk w="measures"/> stocks .

Alternative management systems should be quickly established and , against this backdrop , I consider that <unk w="the"/> EU should be swifter in <unk w="any"/> alternative approaches , given that some , <unk w="such"/> as management based on fishing rights ( for example ) , form the cornerstone in countries such as the United States , <unk w="new"/> Zealand , Norway and Iceland , all with a strong tradition and great potential in the fisheries <unk w="sector"/> .

Although I do not agree <unk w="with"/> the whole content of <unk w="the"/> adopted <unk w="tomorrow"/> , it does <unk w="have"/> a series of important objectives and principles that should <unk w="be"/> in a fisheries policy .

It will be particularly important to reaffirm and defend these objectives and principles ( as the Portuguese <unk w="democrat"/> Party ( PCP ) has <unk w="consistently"/> done ) , many of which <unk w="are"/> not respected <unk w="by"/> the common fisheries policy ( CFP ) ( even though some are included in it ) , when the European Commission announces the presentation , next April , of a green paper <unk w="on"/> the <unk w="future"/> of the common fisheries policy , <unk w="indicating"/> a possible reform of <unk w="this"/> policy by 2012 .

Given the objectives and intentions which have been set out by the European Commission and other EU institutions on the future of the fishing industry , this sector in <unk w="Portugal"/> - which is in deep <unk w="crisis"/> , <unk w="the"/> causes of which lie in the <unk w="onerous"/> policies followed for decades <unk w="at"/> national and Community level - should be alert to and should mobilise against new and even more onerous measures .

If adopted and applied , <unk w="these"/> would bring about the destruction of a large part of this strategic sector , with negative consequences for Portugal .

There are alternative <unk w="policies"/> for the fishing industry in Portugal .

These are policies which the PCP has been <unk w="proposing"/> and defending at both national level and in the European Parliament .

in <unk w="writing"/> . - I voted <unk w="in"/> favour of <unk w="Mr"/> Guerreiro 's report .

The report correctly notes that EU fisheries policy should promote the modernisation and sustainable development of the fishing industry , safeguarding its socio-economic viability and the sustainability <unk w="of"/> fisheries resources , <unk w="and"/> guaranteeing the supply of <unk w="fish"/> to <unk w="the"/> public <unk w="and"/> food sovereignty and security , the preservation of <unk w="jobs"/> and improved living conditions for <unk w="fishermen"/> .

This is the opposite of what <unk w="the"/> CFP has achieved over the last three <unk w="decades"/> , and accordingly I support the repatriation of fisheries <unk w="management"/> .

Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of <unk w="Mr"/> Guerreiro 's report on the CFP ( common fisheries policy ) and the ecosystem approach <unk w="to"/> fisheries management .
