It <unk w="is"/> important <unk w="for"/> me to <unk w="take"/> advantage of the 10th <unk w="incidence"/> of this key event in European <unk w="affairs"/> to pay <unk w="tribute"/> , in <unk w="this"/> turn , <unk w="to"/> those <unk w="people"/> who <unk w="use"/> the euro , such as Pierre <unk w="netherlands"/> , Helmut Kohl , <unk w="mr"/> Mitterrand , Jacques Delors , Valéry Giscard d 'Estaing and others .

I <unk w="would"/> like , <unk w="once"/> again , <unk w="to"/> applaud their <unk w="view"/> , their determination and their unfailing commitment <unk w="to"/> Europe .

Those I have mentioned , and <unk w="the"/> others who accompanied them , could <unk w="we"/> have <unk w="been"/> the <unk w="same"/> success <unk w="of"/> their political <unk w="opponents"/> .

Since 1 <unk w="february"/> of this <unk w="year"/> , <unk w="the"/> Member <unk w="states"/> have <unk w="been"/> participating in the Economic <unk w="and"/> Monetary <unk w="union"/> and the <unk w="euro"/> is the currency <unk w="of"/> almost 330 million <unk w="of"/> citizens .

The <unk w="commission"/> , then , has become <unk w="the"/> most tangible <unk w="factor"/> of European integration .

As a <unk w="good"/> sign recognised around the world , <unk w="the"/> euro is a measure of stability .

It is <unk w="for"/> its citizens from the <unk w="most"/> serious <unk w="organisation"/> of <unk w="the"/> economic <unk w="situation"/> .

After 10 <unk w="years"/> , it has <unk w="to"/> be recognised <unk w="that"/> the euro is an unquestionable <unk w="one"/> .

Now , <unk w="we"/> only have value if <unk w="they"/> are <unk w="used"/> to <unk w="the"/> future , as <unk w="we"/> have <unk w="to"/> recognise that , <unk w="in"/> our collective indulgence as we congratulate ourselves , the true tests <unk w="on"/> the cohesiveness <unk w="and"/> coherence of the euro area await us .

<unk w="last"/> year , 2009 , will be <unk w="an"/> extremely <unk w="this"/> year <unk w="of"/> the euro <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> economies and for <unk w="our"/> citizens and there will be <unk w="the"/> challenges facing us , both internally <unk w="and"/> externally .

<unk w="unfortunately"/> , euro area governments <unk w="will"/> have <unk w="to"/> act <unk w="and"/> to <unk w="mitigate"/> the effects <unk w="of"/> the economic <unk w="growth"/> and invest in the structural bases <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="union"/> to build a <unk w="solution"/> to <unk w="the"/> post-crisis <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .

We must <unk w="not"/> lose sight <unk w="of"/> the fact that <unk w="the"/> euro , this protective screen we <unk w="have"/> built around our <unk w="classes"/> , did <unk w="not"/> just fall <unk w="on"/> our <unk w="eyes"/> .

The <unk w="free-trade"/> area <unk w="we"/> are better <unk w="directed"/> against <unk w="enormous"/> economic developments because being <unk w="part"/> of <unk w="the"/> euro <unk w=","/> is a <unk w="question"/> of quality certifying <unk w="and"/> its members have a <unk w="military"/> capacity <unk w="for"/> implementing <unk w="sound"/> macroeconomic policies and <unk w="programmes"/> based on sustained growth and prosperity <unk w="for"/> its citizens .

The protection afforded by the <unk w="commission"/> is therefore <unk w="closely"/> linked <unk w="to"/> our credibility , <unk w="which"/> rests <unk w="on"/> the <unk w="need"/> to implement <unk w="community"/> policies .

<unk w="this"/> credibility is <unk w="the"/> foundation <unk w="for"/> the benefits of Economic and <unk w="monetary"/> Union and we must <unk w="encourage"/> it to continue fully <unk w="respecting"/> profit <unk w="from"/> the <unk w="creation"/> of <unk w="the"/> single currency .

Externally , we <unk w="need"/> to <unk w="take"/> the political lessons from <unk w="the"/> international financial and economic crisis .

There <unk w="is"/> a direct <unk w="direct"/> link between the <unk w="current"/> crisis , with <unk w="the"/> origins in the United States , and <unk w="the"/> persistence <unk w=","/> major <unk w="regional"/> imbalances .

The lack <unk w="of"/> sufficient <unk w="interest"/> , responsibility <unk w="and"/> integrity <unk w="and"/> the financial sector therefore acted <unk w="as"/> a catalyst <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="future"/> .

The re-establishment <unk w="of"/> stability in the financial <unk w="markets"/> the real <unk w="market"/> on a world scale implies a <unk w="major"/> reform of <unk w="the"/> financial <unk w="management"/> and the elimination of the <unk w="serious"/> imbalances in <unk w="the"/> mix <unk w="of"/> global consumption <unk w="in"/> global <unk w="market"/> .

This balancing <unk w="is"/> the active <unk w="part"/> of <unk w="the"/> major economies in America , Asia and Europe .

<unk w="the"/> noticeable progress , the euro <unk w="on"/> international <unk w="cooperation"/> remains , too often , overly fragmented and national interests too <unk w="and"/> win <unk w="precedence"/> over the common interest , preventing <unk w="the"/> euro area <unk w=","/> fully <unk w="respect"/> the political responsibility <unk w="which"/> corresponds to its economic <unk w="policy"/> and <unk w="in"/> achieving all <unk w="of"/> the economic <unk w="situation"/> deriving from <unk w="economic"/> and <unk w="european"/> Union .

Economic <unk w="and"/> Monetary Union is , of course , an economic project , <unk w="and"/> it is , <unk w="first"/> of <unk w="all"/> , a political <unk w="solution"/> .

<unk w="as"/> a result , <unk w="we"/> must take <unk w="account"/> of the <unk w="commission"/> 's second <unk w="decision"/> to <unk w="both"/> the <unk w="eu"/> and <unk w="the"/> Union by strengthening <unk w="the"/> political bodies , both internally and externally .

<unk w="mr"/> President , <unk w="prime"/> Minister , Chairmen of the <unk w="council"/> , <unk w="ladies"/> and <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , I am sure <unk w="that"/> I <unk w="am"/> echoing the <unk w="opinion"/> of the <unk w="vast"/> majority of this Chamber in saying that , <unk w="when"/> years after its launch , I , <unk w="as"/> a <unk w="case"/> , am proud <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="outcome"/> of the <unk w="commission"/> .

I <unk w="would"/> like to congratulate <unk w="parliament"/> on its initiative to commemorate the 10th anniversary of <unk w="the"/> single <unk w="part-session"/> here , in this Plenary Chamber <unk w="in"/> the European Parliament in Strasbourg .

The <unk w="social"/> and Economic and Monetary <unk w="union"/> have <unk w="always"/> been a <unk w="priority"/> .

Over <unk w="the"/> 10 years , the <unk w="commission"/> has brought many <unk w="times"/> to all its members and <unk w="not"/> to do so <unk w=","/> amid a <unk w="good"/> economic and financial crisis .

Within the short <unk w="space"/> of a <unk w="year"/> , the euro has <unk w="been"/> a well-deserved <unk w="factor"/> for strength and stability .

The <unk w="first"/> is <unk w="the"/> second <unk w="of"/> the world 's currencies <unk w="and"/> , <unk w="according"/> to its role in <unk w="the"/> international economy , <unk w="is"/> already <unk w="stated"/> in some <unk w="way"/> to <unk w="the"/> dollar as an instrument of <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and means of payment in international finance .

Above <unk w="all"/> , though , <unk w="the"/> euro <unk w="is"/> part <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="private"/> life of <unk w="eur"/> 330 million <unk w=","/> in 16 <unk w="%"/> of the European Union .

<unk w="we"/> all <unk w=","/> in our wallets this <unk w="is"/> of a <unk w="new"/> European identity : because the <unk w="baltic"/> , <unk w="as"/> well as being a currency , <unk w="is"/> a <unk w="key"/> element <unk w="in"/> our European <unk w="union"/> , <unk w="remind"/> us in a tangible way of <unk w="the"/> benefits of <unk w="the"/> integration process that began <unk w="by"/> half a century <unk w="ago"/> .

The euro has given us low inflation and <unk w="low"/> interest rates , thanks to a macroeconomic <unk w="strategy"/> directed at stability .

<unk w="the"/> euro has <unk w="been"/> a clear boost to trade <unk w="and"/> investment among its <unk w="member"/> States .

<unk w="the"/> euro <unk w="has"/> also facilitated the <unk w="growth"/> of <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> million jobs over the <unk w="last"/> 10 years in <unk w="the"/> euro area , three times <unk w="the"/> corresponding figure <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="next"/> decade .

The <unk w="commission"/> has encouraged financial integration and <unk w="the"/> development of <unk w="the"/> single market ; <unk w="it"/> has protected the members of the euro area from external disruption ; and <unk w="it"/> has <unk w="increased"/> and continues <unk w="to"/> be a <unk w="matter"/> of stability , not <unk w="just"/> for <unk w="the"/> European economy , but <unk w="also"/> for the global <unk w="economy"/> .

The <unk w="commission"/> is , without a doubt , a touchstone for the <unk w="future"/> .

<unk w="however"/> , those who <unk w="believe"/> that the <unk w="economic"/> and Monetary Union <unk w="are"/> not <unk w="have"/> to face <unk w="the"/> consequences of <unk w="the"/> crisis <unk w="is"/> quite <unk w="clearly"/> .

<unk w="on"/> the contrary , if <unk w="a"/> single <unk w="market"/> did <unk w="not"/> exist , the <unk w="negative"/> effects of the crisis would be <unk w="much"/> greater .

<unk w="the"/> Member <unk w="states"/> would <unk w="not"/> be <unk w="any"/> great volatility in their exchange <unk w=","/> and , <unk w="unfortunately"/> , <unk w="may"/> even be suffering speculative <unk w="people"/> on <unk w="national"/> currencies .

<unk w="the"/> spread <unk w="to"/> their public <unk w="pension"/> securities would <unk w="be"/> much greater <unk w="than"/> currently , <unk w="in"/> their margins for <unk w="alleviate"/> the crisis through <unk w="the"/> stimuli would <unk w="be"/> narrower .

The <unk w="competitiveness"/> and Growth <unk w="policy"/> , reformed in <unk w="flanders"/> , <unk w="and"/> encouraged governments to sort out their <unk w="own"/> accounts , <unk w="particularly"/> in 2007 to the <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> budget deficit for <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> years , which is now enabling them to face the crisis in a <unk w="difficult"/> situation .

Throughout this <unk w="house"/> , <unk w="the"/> actions of the European <unk w="central"/> Bank have done nothing but <unk w="for"/> the <unk w="great"/> reputation that <unk w="it"/> had <unk w="been"/> earned <unk w="in"/> the early years of Economic and Monetary Union .

By <unk w="parliament"/> adopting <unk w="the"/> necessary measures and taking <unk w="the"/> lead in cooperating with the other central banks <unk w="from"/> industrialised countries , the European Central Bank has served as <unk w="a"/> guide throughout this period <unk w="and"/> has <unk w="greatly"/> contributed to preventing <unk w="the"/> financial collapse .

The economic <unk w="situation"/> is <unk w=","/> as <unk w="it"/> would have hoped <unk w="that"/> we <unk w="condemn"/> this <unk w="evening"/> , <unk w="when"/> events are highlighting more <unk w="than"/> ever the advantages of Economic <unk w="and"/> Monetary Union .

<unk w="in"/> those countries <unk w="which"/> have <unk w="not"/> yet joined , the <unk w="free-trade"/> area is an increasingly attractive <unk w="one"/> , as demonstrated <unk w="last"/> week in <unk w="stockholm"/> when we <unk w="become"/> Slovakia as <unk w="a"/> newest - the 16th - member of <unk w="the"/> euro family .

The European Commission and Parliament <unk w="will"/> continue <unk w="up"/> with <unk w="member"/> States , the Eurogroup , the European Central Bank <unk w="and"/> the international <unk w="community"/> in order <unk w="to"/> place our economies on the path <unk w="to"/> the sustainable resumption of growth .

In <unk w="this"/> regard , the Commission <unk w="'s"/> recommendations in the report <unk w="that"/> we submitted a <unk w="few"/> months ago on the first <unk w="ten"/> years of Economic and Monetary Union , which <unk w="was"/> recently debated <unk w="in"/> this <unk w="afternoon"/> , <unk w="is"/> as valid or <unk w="even"/> more valid today than they were <unk w="in"/> spring .

Increased budgetary vigilance , its extension <unk w="to"/> other macroeconomic <unk w="reforms"/> , <unk w="to"/> link <unk w="between"/> macroeconomic policies and structural reform , <unk w="the"/> external <unk w="value"/> of the euro and improved governance of <unk w="the"/> Economic and Monetary <unk w="union"/> are , <unk w="we"/> must <unk w="continue"/> to be , the <unk w="main"/> themes on <unk w="which"/> to base the euro <unk w="for"/> second decade , with <unk w="at"/> least as many <unk w="countries"/> as <unk w="the"/> first one .

<unk w="mr"/> President , I <unk w="would"/> like to conclude <unk w="by"/> paying <unk w="tribute"/> to <unk w="the"/> vision <unk w="and"/> ambition <unk w="which"/> the founding fathers of <unk w="the"/> euro , whose imagination and resolute action <unk w="is"/> to <unk w="create"/> a <unk w="series"/> of which all <unk w="we"/> can be proud .

The crisis has opened up a <unk w="new"/> chapter <unk w="on"/> the global <unk w="agreement"/> , <unk w="in"/> which the <unk w="economic"/> and Monetary Union must <unk w="continue"/> to <unk w="play"/> a <unk w="leading"/> role <unk w="in"/> serving the common interests and ambitions <unk w="of"/> all Europeans .

<unk w="mr"/> President , Mr <unk w="president"/> , Mr <unk w="president-in-office"/> , ladies and <unk w="gentlemen"/> , everyone <unk w="who"/> has been involved <unk w="in"/> creating <unk w="a"/> European currency <unk w="and"/> grateful <unk w="to"/> you , <unk w="mr"/> President , <unk w="like"/> to <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , ladies <unk w="and"/> gentlemen , <unk w="that"/> this <unk w="new"/> fine initiative which <unk w="will"/> have taken <unk w="part"/> commemorating the <unk w="50th"/> anniversary <unk w="of"/> the birth <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="sea"/> .

I <unk w="am"/> one of those <unk w="people"/> who think <unk w="that"/> it is better <unk w="to"/> avoid the ever-increasing <unk w="number"/> of commemoration ceremonies , <unk w="and"/> this <unk w="report"/> is justified <unk w="because"/> it marks the greatest contribution to <unk w="european"/> integration since <unk w="the"/> election of <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> by universal suffrage <unk w="in"/> 1979 .

We have <unk w="to"/> come a long way <unk w=","/> perhaps this <unk w="week"/> , <unk w="madam"/> gathering does <unk w="not"/> paint <unk w="the"/> whole <unk w="process"/> .

I would <unk w="like"/> to pay tribute <unk w="to"/> all those who <unk w="carry"/> out this course and those who have followed it .

We <unk w="must"/> find its distant origins in the report from the <unk w="swedish"/> prime minister , Pierre Werner , <unk w="his"/> predecessor , in 1970 .

It was , however , <unk w="a"/> monetary crisis <unk w="over"/> the years <unk w=","/> followed <unk w="by"/> the currency flotation <unk w="has"/> triggered action in <unk w="this"/> area .

As long <unk w="as"/> the currency <unk w=","/> rates <unk w="is"/> fixed , the monetary system did not <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> our <unk w="desire"/> to create a <unk w="single"/> market .

However , as <unk w="soon"/> as <unk w="you"/> were floating , this problem <unk w="is"/> its head .

<unk w="if"/> the unsuccessful <unk w="attempt"/> to create a monetary snake , the strong momentum from France and <unk w="germany"/> between 1975 and 1980 led to the meeting <unk w="in"/> Bremen , in northern <unk w="finland"/> , and the <unk w="need"/> to <unk w="achieve"/> the European Monetary <unk w="fund"/> and introduce the <unk w="market"/> , the euro 's precursor .

<unk w="this"/> move <unk w="on"/> the backing and <unk w="commitment"/> of our <unk w="colleagues"/> in the <unk w="candidate"/> countries and Italy .

After a <unk w="year"/> of <unk w="the"/> activity <unk w="of"/> 1980 <unk w="and"/> 1988 , the process <unk w="was"/> given <unk w="the"/> impetus <unk w="to"/> the creation by <unk w="the"/> Council <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="president"/> chaired by Jacques Delors , <unk w="and"/> in the signature of <unk w="the"/> Maastricht Treaty .

<unk w="let"/> us salute the <unk w="people"/> who <unk w="have"/> been involved in <unk w="them"/> along <unk w="the"/> way , as you yourself have <unk w="said"/> , <unk w="mr"/> President , as well <unk w="as"/> my <unk w="predecessor"/> , Chancellor Helmut <unk w=","/> and his <unk w="friend"/> of <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , Manfred Lahnstein ; Bernard <unk w="president"/> , the governor <unk w="of"/> the Banque de <unk w="cabinet"/> at the <unk w="portuguese"/> and co-author <unk w=","/> Robert Schuman <unk w="'"/> Declaration <unk w="of"/> 1950 ; Alexandre Lamfalussy , who <unk w="provides"/> us with his <unk w="words"/> , almost <unk w="his"/> expertise during <unk w="the"/> work of the committee on <unk w="the"/> monetary union which we <unk w="drew"/> up with <unk w="mr"/> Schmidt <unk w="to"/> relaunch the project ; Jacques Delors , President of <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="parliament"/> , <unk w="who"/> took <unk w="place"/> ; <unk w="however"/> , last but <unk w="not"/> least , the <unk w="commission"/> and <unk w="protocol"/> of the Maastricht Treaty who <unk w="is"/> an excellent <unk w="report"/> , which has <unk w="not"/> actually been <unk w=","/> since <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> , headed by Chancellor <unk w=","/> Kohl and President <unk w=","/> Mitterrand , <unk w="this"/> determination must <unk w="be"/> mentioned in particular , along <unk w="with"/> their other colleagues .

<unk w="but"/> we must say a <unk w="word"/> ' thank you ' <unk w="and"/> all <unk w="of"/> them .

<unk w="in"/> this <unk w="stage"/> of the 10th <unk w="declaration"/> , being celebrated at a <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of crisis , <unk w="i"/> can <unk w="only"/> say in <unk w="terms"/> of the <unk w="future"/> ?

<unk w="these"/> fine words <unk w=","/> we use in our <unk w="own"/> toasts ?

First <unk w="of"/> all , <unk w="the"/> euro <unk w="a"/> success has exceeded expectations , not only of all its <unk w="but"/> , <unk w="of"/> course , but even of <unk w="all"/> its <unk w="nature"/> .

I will not <unk w="look"/> into <unk w=","/> as you have only <unk w="told"/> me five minutes .

<unk w="in"/> the <unk w="comments"/> which I had with <unk w="the"/> most eminent <unk w="of"/> experts between 1995 and <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> , they <unk w="are"/> all sceptical <unk w="about"/> the <unk w="problem"/> of <unk w="both"/> the euro and <unk w="make"/> it a success .

<unk w="for"/> 10 years <unk w="of"/> euro <unk w="has"/> become <unk w="a"/> number <unk w="of"/> currency in <unk w="the"/> world and , as has <unk w="been"/> mentioned just <unk w="now"/> , one of <unk w="the"/> most <unk w="important"/> currencies .

Its sound management has <unk w="been"/> a <unk w="direct"/> shield against <unk w="the"/> crisis <unk w="as"/> a platform for <unk w="economic"/> growth .

<unk w="in"/> the <unk w="introduction"/> of the euro , mainland <unk w="farming"/> would be currently turned <unk w="away"/> down by a monetary tornado , <unk w="which"/> would deepen the economic crisis .

We <unk w="are"/> expecting the <unk w="european"/> policy to <unk w="go"/> to <unk w="us"/> , within <unk w="the"/> limits <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="commission"/> 's power , the depressing impact <unk w="of"/> the crisis <unk w="and"/> to pave the way <unk w="for"/> the return to non-inflationary <unk w="situation"/> , which we are <unk w="currently"/> tackling yet , by which time <unk w=","/> sizeable <unk w=","/> deficits and <unk w="which"/> of <unk w="course"/> triggered by the crisis <unk w="prior"/> to <unk w="have"/> been cleared .

In <unk w="this"/> respect , <unk w="we"/> are <unk w="above"/> our trust <unk w="in"/> the managers and staff at the <unk w="european"/> Central Bank , who have demonstrated their <unk w="considerable"/> expertise <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="field"/> of <unk w="the"/> crisis .

We must be careful not <unk w="to"/> try to give the euro a <unk w="new"/> dimension , which would flatter our <unk w="credibility"/> , but would multiply <unk w="the"/> risks <unk w="we"/> face .

The <unk w="commission"/> is <unk w="turkey"/> 's <unk w=","/> and must express its distinct <unk w="condemnation"/> , <unk w="in"/> a rational and stable <unk w="manner"/> among the <unk w="eu"/> 's other <unk w="cultures"/> .

Finally , I do not think that <unk w="the"/> general <unk w="approach"/> will need to <unk w="be"/> too long for <unk w="the"/> regulation to <unk w="be"/> restored in the euro area .

It seems to me <unk w="that"/> we could call on the European <unk w="central"/> Bank to <unk w="carry"/> out <unk w="the"/> process of restoring order and supervise its <unk w="powers"/> , <unk w="pursuant"/> to <unk w="rule"/> 106 ( 5 ) of the Maastricht <unk w="treaty"/> .

<unk w="however"/> , we <unk w="give"/> a strong impetus , expertise and a decision <unk w="to"/> which the European Central <unk w="bank"/> could <unk w="follow"/> up and which the <unk w="council"/> of Ministers for <unk w="the"/> euro area , presided by <unk w="the"/> good self , Mr <unk w="president"/> , could then <unk w="speak"/> and <unk w="understand"/> .

I will <unk w="conclude"/> , Mr President , <unk w="be"/> saying <unk w="that"/> the symbol of <unk w="those"/> represented <unk w="in"/> the euro 's <unk w="republic"/> must <unk w="give"/> us the courage to take the next step in <unk w="implementing"/> this increasingly united Europe as <unk w="well"/> under <unk w="the"/> various treaties and <unk w="that"/> we are endeavouring to <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .

<unk w="let"/> us <unk w=","/> the inevitability <unk w="of"/> failure with the energy <unk w="market"/> success .

That success <unk w="is"/> goes <unk w="beyond"/> the <unk w="new"/> name of the euro .

Mr President , the euro is the <unk w="successful"/> outcome of a vision and political will , and <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="organisation"/> of <unk w="the"/> market .

<unk w="this"/> demonstrates <unk w="the"/> best <unk w="that"/> Europe can <unk w="do"/> when <unk w="it"/> joins <unk w="it"/> .

I also want , <unk w="of"/> course , on <unk w="the"/> occasion <unk w="to"/> salute <unk w="and"/> thank on <unk w="your"/> behalf , on our children <unk w="on"/> behalf and <unk w="on"/> everyone else <unk w="on"/> behalf , the <unk w="moroccan"/> fathers and <unk w="the"/> architects <unk w="of"/> this success : Pierre Werner , <unk w="it"/> is <unk w="before"/> us , Chancellor <unk w=","/> Schmidt , <unk w="the"/> Giscard d <unk w="burg"/> , the President of <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="republic"/> Jacques <unk w="chirac"/> , <unk w="mr"/> Helmut <unk w="palacio"/> , President François <unk w="and"/> , <unk w="mr"/> Alexandre <unk w="costa"/> , <unk w="mr"/> Padoa-Schioppa , <unk w="and"/> Maystadt <unk w="and"/> everyone else <unk w=","/> I have not mentioned .

I would also , <unk w="however"/> , <unk w="like"/> to pay tribute <unk w="to"/> the actions <unk w="of"/> your <unk w="report"/> , Mr President , <unk w="the"/> actions of my predecessors , <unk w="mr"/> von Wogau , <unk w="who"/> is still with <unk w="us"/> , <unk w="that"/> of <unk w="mrs"/> Randzio-Plath , who <unk w="has"/> also <unk w="told"/> us today .

The <unk w="suspension"/> of this <unk w="initiative"/> played a crucial <unk w="role"/> in that , at the time of <unk w="the"/> transition to the euro , we were not <unk w="deeply"/> concerned about the transfer <unk w="of"/> accounts <unk w="for"/> the banks but also about <unk w="the"/> citizens , <unk w="so"/> that <unk w="they"/> could adapt <unk w="together"/> , get used to and adopt <unk w="a"/> new currency which was going <unk w="to"/> be theirs .

I also <unk w="believe"/> that <unk w="the"/> action by <unk w="this"/> institution must be <unk w="defined"/> and given credit .

I am also pleased that <unk w="the"/> ceremony can take <unk w="place"/> here , <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="european"/> Parliament , the <unk w="lack"/> of <unk w="respect"/> for all <unk w="europe"/> 's citizens .

After <unk w="all"/> , <unk w="the"/> euro <unk w="is"/> first and foremost <unk w=","/> concern <unk w="to"/> us all , <unk w="and"/> then of <unk w="our"/> banks .

It is certainly the concern of <unk w="women"/> , <unk w="and"/> they are happy to <unk w="join"/> us .

However , Europeans themselves have <unk w="had"/> the euro as a <unk w="result"/> of <unk w="access"/> to the <unk w="european"/> Union .

There were <unk w="all"/> of us to start with , and <unk w="that"/> there are <unk w="problems"/> .

<unk w="however"/> , I do <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> the <unk w="fact"/> that this <unk w="report"/> is <unk w="not"/> some <unk w="time"/> to reconsider whether <unk w="it"/> should <unk w="apply"/> to the <unk w="free-trade"/> area or not .

I <unk w="think"/> that this is <unk w="the"/> best proof <unk w="of"/> our <unk w="opinion"/> .

<unk w="this"/> makes progress , <unk w="as"/> is <unk w="very"/> often the case , by demonstrating <unk w="the"/> efficiency and <unk w="on"/> this occasion to mark its 10th anniversary , we can <unk w="only"/> see <unk w="that"/> the assessment of the euro is <unk w="just"/> a positive one .

Some countries which were <unk w="and"/> could now knock on <unk w="the"/> door <unk w="of"/> the euro <unk w="externally"/> .

We <unk w="can"/> only encourage <unk w="them"/> to do <unk w="so"/> under the terms <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="cap"/> , which <unk w="has"/> never been revised <unk w="and"/> which are useful terms <unk w="in"/> Europe <unk w="'s"/> progress <unk w="in"/> economic and <unk w="social"/> matters on the basis <unk w="of"/> the two pillars of consolidation <unk w="of"/> enlargement .

<unk w="however"/> , <unk w="the"/> anniversary <unk w="is"/> also a <unk w="reason"/> for looking to the future .

<unk w="the"/> euro , <unk w="which"/> has been <unk w="adopted"/> by <unk w="the"/> last <unk w="ten"/> years , must now <unk w="set"/> up <unk w="the"/> areas for <unk w="it"/> , not that <unk w="they"/> have <unk w="been"/> dealt with these <unk w="at"/> all , <unk w="quite"/> simply because they are still work in progress ahead of us .

<unk w="in"/> the <unk w="problem"/> of economic <unk w="activity"/> , <unk w="the"/> Juncker described <unk w="as"/> crisis <unk w="as"/> we are <unk w="going"/> through .

In <unk w="the"/> current <unk w="way"/> we <unk w="all"/> know that , if we <unk w="have"/> made progress <unk w="in"/> the Economic <unk w="sector"/> as <unk w="well"/> as <unk w="we"/> have <unk w="of"/> the Monetary Union , <unk w="it"/> would be even better <unk w="off"/> today .

It is <unk w="not"/> normal <unk w="for"/> us <unk w="to"/> focus <unk w="on"/> the budget deficit <unk w=","/> and <unk w="based"/> on the quality of <unk w="public"/> spending .

Governments must learn to <unk w="bring"/> together about their economic <unk w="interests"/> .

It is not normal for Member <unk w="states"/> to borrow at such different rates of interest <unk w="and"/> they <unk w="have"/> the same currency and the <unk w="highest"/> rate of <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> set by <unk w="the"/> European Central <unk w="bank"/> .

The same applies <unk w="to"/> it <unk w="is"/> to supervising <unk w="the"/> financial markets .

<unk w="the"/> Giscard d <unk w="'"/> mentioned Article 105 ( 6 ) , which is our common <unk w="objective"/> , allowing <unk w="us"/> to <unk w="make"/> progress .

I think that one of the <unk w="priorities"/> from this crisis is that it actually shows that <unk w="the"/> European Central Bank <unk w="will"/> need to have a <unk w="political"/> role .

<unk w="i"/> do not <unk w="intend"/> to disconnect <unk w="the"/> supervision <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="financial"/> markets from <unk w="international"/> supervision .

However , <unk w="to"/> achieve this , we will also need , as political leaders , <unk w="i"/> think about <unk w="such"/> a balance .

If <unk w="the"/> European Central Bank sees <unk w="its"/> responsibilities <unk w="alone"/> , it <unk w="would"/> have <unk w="to"/> be indicated how <unk w="the"/> institutional <unk w="policy"/> on the <unk w="future"/> needs to <unk w="be"/> established in <unk w="the"/> future .

I <unk w="would"/> like <unk w="to"/> make one final <unk w="comment"/> on <unk w="the"/> international <unk w="organisation"/> of <unk w="the"/> euro .

I <unk w="believe"/> that we must not demand the <unk w="real"/> privilege of being <unk w="a"/> reserve <unk w="""/> .

However , it <unk w="does"/> not <unk w="only"/> either <unk w="for"/> us to <unk w="have"/> taken <unk w="four"/> years to create the <unk w="conditions"/> and <unk w="now"/> , 10 years after the transition to <unk w="the"/> euro , <unk w="there"/> are still passive <unk w="in"/> the international arena and <unk w="a"/> strong voice of <unk w="the"/> euro is not being <unk w="even"/> more clearly <unk w="in"/> the process <unk w="of"/> restoring some balance to the global <unk w="education"/> system .

Finally , I <unk w="think"/> that the euro is much more than just a currency .

<unk w="it"/> is <unk w="why"/> it <unk w="is"/> a major <unk w="problem"/> for <unk w="this"/> Parliament .

<unk w="this"/> is a <unk w="step"/> at the service <unk w="of"/> our <unk w="citizens"/> who are going through the deepest <unk w="sympathy"/> in years .

We <unk w="shall"/> then <unk w="do"/> this wonderful creation , <unk w="a"/> symbol of Europe <unk w="can"/> help <unk w="our"/> citizens come through <unk w="the"/> crisis <unk w="in"/> the best conditions <unk w="attached"/> .

Mr <unk w="president"/> , 10 <unk w="%"/> of <unk w="the"/> euro is indeed a <unk w="way"/> to celebrate .

Anyone who had said 10 years ago <unk w=","/> the <unk w="commission"/> would have developed as splendidly <unk w="as"/> it has done would have <unk w="been"/> laughed <unk w="effect"/> .

Many people have contributed to this <unk w="issue"/> , <unk w="and"/> I <unk w="am"/> many sceptical <unk w="points"/> - <unk w="which"/> was referred to as a <unk w="new"/> baby <unk w="and"/> an unviable project - and <unk w="if"/> we <unk w="believe"/> that it <unk w="is"/> a <unk w="commitment"/> to <unk w="the"/> many people <unk w="present"/> .

<unk w="the"/> previous speaker reminded <unk w="me"/> of all those <unk w="who"/> contributed <unk w="to"/> this , of the <unk w="future"/> , of the European monetary system , <unk w="there"/> was an agreement with the European Central Bank to <unk w="be"/> central rates , of <unk w="the"/> Delors report , <unk w="has"/> provided <unk w="for"/> the <unk w="scope"/> of the monetary <unk w="union"/> in three <unk w="quarters"/> , of the Treaty <unk w="of"/> Maastricht - only two years <unk w="after"/> the <unk w="end"/> of the <unk w="commission"/> - and of <unk w="the"/> transitional <unk w="period"/> .

<unk w="if"/> people <unk w="have"/> helped to make <unk w="the"/> euro the successful <unk w="of"/> it <unk w="is"/> today .

As the <unk w="former"/> chairman , Mrs <unk w="karamanou"/> , has already said , during <unk w="this"/> period , in particular from 1994 when the <unk w="ministry"/> of the <unk w="treaty"/> of <unk w="terrorism"/> began , and <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> to 2002 , Parliament actively cooperated <unk w="with"/> the introduction of the notes and coins , <unk w="and"/> in <unk w="both"/> reports , <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , opinions and <unk w="your"/> proposals , <unk w="and"/> I would like specifically <unk w="to"/> thank the two <unk w="group"/> chairmen from that time , <unk w="mr"/> von Wogau <unk w="and"/> Mrs Randzio-Plath , who <unk w="is"/> represented <unk w="this"/> to the <unk w="outside"/> world and <unk w="he"/> gave <unk w="the"/> project , <unk w="were"/> originally <unk w="proposed"/> by the <unk w="commission"/> , <unk w="the"/> parliamentary <unk w="term"/> it needed .

We are working <unk w="together"/> , <unk w="honestly"/> , under <unk w="the"/> chairmanship of Mrs Berès , for <unk w="the"/> same representation .

<unk w="on"/> 18 November <unk w="was"/> adopted , with a <unk w="large"/> majority , a <unk w="situation"/> in <unk w="which"/> we <unk w="are"/> the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , challenges , risks <unk w="and"/> problems , and I would like <unk w="to"/> mention <unk w="such"/> a <unk w="few"/> things in addition to what Mrs <unk w="lucas"/> has said .

<unk w="the"/> euro <unk w="has"/> been a great <unk w="deal"/> , <unk w="because"/> it <unk w="is"/> a unique project : a central <unk w="foreign"/> policy under the management of <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="central"/> Bank and local <unk w="communities"/> and <unk w="national"/> policies .

It <unk w="is"/> important <unk w="that"/> , <unk w="in"/> future , the connection between <unk w="the"/> two levels of <unk w="development"/> in <unk w="the"/> Stability and Growth Pact <unk w="is"/> retained also during <unk w="times"/> of crisis .

Without <unk w="the"/> Stability and Growth Pact , <unk w="the"/> stronger coordination <unk w="between"/> the budgetary and finance policy , the <unk w="council"/> would also in <unk w="the"/> face <unk w="of"/> that <unk w="the"/> avoidable .

<unk w="in"/> this regard , I appeal <unk w="in"/> particular <unk w="to"/> the Member States of <unk w="the"/> euro area , <unk w="but"/> also to <unk w="the"/> whole <unk w="of"/> the European Union , <unk w="to"/> take this <unk w="approach"/> , <unk w="a"/> coordinated <unk w="approach"/> , more seriously <unk w=","/> has <unk w="been"/> the <unk w="case"/> in <unk w="the"/> past in connection <unk w="with"/> certain issues .

The <unk w="commission"/> has pushed down <unk w="them"/> considerably and <unk w="has"/> created confidence <unk w="in"/> stability , <unk w="and"/> it <unk w="has"/> become <unk w="the"/> second most commonly held <unk w="a"/> currency in a <unk w="series"/> of <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> that <unk w="is"/> one <unk w="of"/> it capable of .

<unk w="the"/> euro <unk w="has"/> increased the <unk w="need"/> for <unk w="structural"/> reform in <unk w="the"/> Member States <unk w="and"/> therefore , even in <unk w="the"/> age <unk w="of"/> globalisation , has <unk w="created"/> a ' <unk w="peace"/> programme ' for <unk w="once"/> and for <unk w="example"/> .

The <unk w="creation"/> of the <unk w="free-trade"/> area - <unk w="which"/> were <unk w="caused"/> by the previous <unk w="speaker"/> - the Ecofin Council , the Euro Group and <unk w="the"/> other <unk w="countries"/> have created <unk w="the"/> necessary <unk w=","/> together <unk w="with"/> the Commission <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="european"/> Central Bank , because <unk w="we"/> were <unk w="not"/> operating , because they were in place , because <unk w="they"/> worked independently in order <unk w="to"/> react quickly , <unk w="quickly"/> and <unk w="even"/> in <unk w="the"/> economic <unk w="situation"/> .

We <unk w="have"/> experienced the <unk w="problem"/> as a <unk w="pretext"/> for creating a European financial market .

<unk w="the"/> political conclusion from these <unk w="two"/> successes is <unk w="in"/> states with a <unk w="single"/> currency <unk w="and"/> a <unk w="single"/> internal market have achieved a unique level of integration that <unk w="can"/> secure peace <unk w="and"/> prosperity .

However , we cannot <unk w="only"/> take <unk w="the"/> euro for granted <unk w="in"/> future .

There are numerous <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> requests <unk w="and"/> demands <unk w="to"/> take the risks seriously : <unk w="""/> drifting apart of the <unk w="national"/> economies , which is associated <unk w="with"/> considerable <unk w="concern"/> in connection <unk w="with"/> the <unk w="size"/> of <unk w="agriculture"/> and <unk w="the"/> budget deficits , should not be <unk w="passed"/> on this <unk w="matter"/> .

An entirely different aspect is the varying development <unk w="of"/> the interest rates <unk w="by"/> government bonds .

We <unk w="are"/> currently <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> the <unk w="highest"/> rate <unk w="which"/> , <unk w="which"/> has no doubt <unk w="been"/> , <unk w="once"/> again , <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="series"/> of <unk w="the"/> problems <unk w="in"/> this <unk w="country"/> for individual Member States within the <unk w="schengen"/> area .

I would <unk w="remind"/> the House <unk w="that"/> , particularly <unk w="in"/> connection with the <unk w="introduction"/> of the euro <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> , no special <unk w="priority"/> may be given <unk w="to"/> that all states <unk w="that"/> are members <unk w="of"/> the euro area <unk w="too"/> , <unk w="we"/> must , comply with these conditions <unk w=","/> the Treaty <unk w="of"/> Maastricht .

It has <unk w="been"/> the first test <unk w="which"/> has provided a unique contribution to <unk w="the"/> permanent integration of our <unk w="communities"/> in <unk w="colombia"/> .

<unk w="mr"/> President , Mr Giscard d 'Estaing , <unk w="schmidt"/> Juncker , Mr Trichet , Mr Almunia , <unk w="ladies"/> and gentlemen , many good <unk w="people"/> have <unk w="already"/> been <unk w="done"/> .

<unk w="in"/> 10 <unk w="p.m."/> , <unk w="the"/> euro <unk w="has"/> become a strong symbol for <unk w="peace"/> .

<unk w="but"/> the idea <unk w="that"/> Europe could <unk w="create"/> a single currency , <unk w="the"/> foundations were laid especially <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="peace"/> agreement <unk w="and"/> the monetary system in <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> and the creation <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="eib"/> , <unk w="which"/> have been met at the <unk w="time"/> with scepticism from the <unk w="commission"/> and the main <unk w="spanish"/> authorities outside Europe .

We should <unk w="also"/> thank and <unk w="congratulate"/> all those who made <unk w="this"/> decision and whose names have <unk w="been"/> mentioned <unk w="today"/> .

The creation <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="consumer"/> is <unk w="the"/> best proof <unk w="in"/> Europe <unk w="is"/> capable , given the political <unk w="will"/> , to <unk w="take"/> long-term decisions for a <unk w="better"/> , <unk w="in"/> future .

This anniversary , then , gives us a particularly <unk w="positive"/> message of <unk w="responsibility"/> for today <unk w="many"/> times .

It must <unk w="be"/> said , however , that among our fellow citizens <unk w=","/> until recently <unk w=","/> were mixed <unk w="out"/> of the euro .

For <unk w="people"/> who travel , the advantage of a single <unk w="market"/> was obvious .

For those who do <unk w="not"/> , the euro was <unk w="paying"/> with price <unk w="stability"/> .

<unk w="we"/> have , <unk w="in"/> fact , <unk w="been"/> that in most <unk w="of"/> inflation was felt <unk w="even"/> though <unk w="the"/> official figures <unk w="show"/> that , due <unk w="specifically"/> to the action <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="european"/> Central Bank , monetary stability <unk w="has"/> been ensured .

<unk w="the"/> reality is <unk w="that"/> some definitely <unk w="the"/> advantage <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="need"/> to <unk w="set"/> up <unk w="the"/> prices <unk w=","/> perhaps <unk w="we"/> were not vigilant enough .

When the euro has <unk w="been"/> against the dollar , we <unk w="have"/> also <unk w="received"/> comments from some <unk w="members"/> who for the <unk w="most"/> part <unk w=","/> in <unk w="the"/> euro <unk w=","/> but <unk w="also"/> outside <unk w="the"/> area .

The European Central Bank <unk w="has"/> not been without <unk w="any"/> critics , who have <unk w="been"/> called into question <unk w="of"/> independence <unk w="but"/> rather its <unk w="policy"/> on interest <unk w="rates"/> , which <unk w="is"/> to <unk w="be"/> too high .

We all understand <unk w="that"/> the <unk w="problem"/> is a determining <unk w="factor"/> in <unk w="which"/> the European repercussions <unk w="on"/> a <unk w="little"/> imported from the United States .

The European Central Bank <unk w="has"/> certainly been the <unk w="european"/> responsive <unk w="world"/> bank .

What would the situation have been if <unk w="the"/> various Member States had each <unk w="right"/> to defend <unk w="their"/> own <unk w="european"/> currency ?

Devaluations would have <unk w="been"/> inevitable and <unk w="i"/> would not have <unk w="been"/> a <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> crisis .

The welcome results <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="commission"/> must <unk w="enable"/> us to <unk w="support"/> and <unk w="to"/> broaden the coordination of <unk w="community"/> policies <unk w="designed"/> to respect the principles of the <unk w="stability"/> and <unk w="stability"/> Pact .

It <unk w="is"/> true , <unk w="at"/> present , that exceptions <unk w=","/> and perhaps <unk w="cannot"/> be accepted , but they can <unk w="only"/> be <unk w="integrated"/> and <unk w="the"/> objective of <unk w="the"/> public finances must be <unk w="defined"/> .

<unk w="the"/> public <unk w="health"/> and economic <unk w="policy"/> are , <unk w="in"/> fact , <unk w="in"/> the long run , more than <unk w="the"/> necessary .

They are <unk w="a"/> condition for <unk w="the"/> solidity <unk w="of"/> our <unk w="democracies"/> , the euro .

Mr President , during these <unk w="years"/> of uncertainty , <unk w="it"/> is important <unk w="to"/> be able to count <unk w="on"/> something <unk w="of"/> a <unk w="added"/> value : the euro .

As I was able <unk w="to"/> play a bit-part as a <unk w="series"/> of <unk w="the"/> Ecofin Council <unk w="and"/> the period of preparation for the <unk w="european"/> single currency , I could see <unk w="my"/> doubts on <unk w="both"/> sides of <unk w="the"/> argument <unk w="that"/> the pussyfooting <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="member"/> States , which ultimately made the <unk w="union"/> into a stronger forum for <unk w="going"/> ahead <unk w="of"/> its <unk w="future"/> .

<unk w="however"/> , two <unk w="of"/> Europe 's finest <unk w="party"/> came about <unk w="with"/> the determination of a few <unk w="years"/> to forge ahead in <unk w="european"/> integration something real for all <unk w="our"/> fellow <unk w="citizens"/> .

I am <unk w="referring"/> to the Schengen Agreement <unk w="and"/> the free movement <unk w="of"/> Europeans , <unk w="which"/> was implemented on the initiative of five <unk w="countries"/> : France , with <unk w="the"/> Mitterrand , <unk w="who"/> , <unk w="and"/> Chancellor Kohl , <unk w="together"/> with the <unk w="candidate"/> countries .

<unk w="it"/> has <unk w="now"/> become <unk w="part"/> of the Schengen <unk w="agreement"/> , but <unk w="the"/> British and Irish are <unk w="not"/> shying away from this people 's Europe .

President <unk w="prodi"/> and Chancellor <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> were also the political <unk w="declaration"/> of the <unk w="commission"/> , even though there were many who supported this monetary <unk w="package"/> , starting with Jacques Delors .

The first lesson I would <unk w="like"/> to draw from this is that anyone <unk w="who"/> wants a better <unk w="and"/> must not <unk w="be"/> afraid <unk w="the"/> intergovernmental <unk w="conference"/> , especially if <unk w="there"/> is a coalition of states <unk w="who"/> really want to move Europe forward .

<unk w="mr"/> Prüm <unk w="however"/> , <unk w="it"/> is <unk w="not"/> to <unk w="a"/> serious crime , <unk w="as"/> an example of this positive enhanced cooperation <unk w="in"/> Europe .

<unk w="at"/> a time when <unk w="the"/> Constitutional Treaty <unk w="is"/> dead <unk w="and"/> buried , <unk w="on"/> the ' <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> ' <unk w=","/> from a strange coalition of political forces not only <unk w="in"/> France but in <unk w="the"/> Netherlands <unk w="too"/> , <unk w="and"/> when the indigestible <unk w="outbreak"/> of <unk w="widely"/> known as the ' <unk w="eu"/> ' Treaty of Lisbon is <unk w="being"/> blocked in Ireland and <unk w="elsewhere"/> in the Czech Republic as well , <unk w="they"/> should prove <unk w="that"/> Europe is still functioning by <unk w="progress"/> on the huge <unk w="impact"/> of enhanced cooperation .

In any case , <unk w="the"/> attraction <unk w="that"/> the <unk w="situation"/> remains intact .

Others are <unk w="talking"/> about <unk w="this"/> being <unk w="able"/> to <unk w="do"/> more from <unk w="a"/> protective shield <unk w="generated"/> by the euro .

<unk w="we"/> in the UK voices are being <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , questioning <unk w="the"/> country 's splendid <unk w="lives"/> in <unk w="the"/> face <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="eu"/> 's collapse , which has <unk w="caused"/> its status fall from that of the world <unk w="and"/> reserve currency <unk w="and"/> a run-of-the-mill currency in less <unk w="than"/> a <unk w="disadvantage"/> .

Thanks <unk w="to"/> the consistent <unk w="position"/> of Wim Duisenberg , Jean-Claude Trichet and the <unk w="commission"/> , the <unk w="eu"/> has become <unk w="the"/> world <unk w="and"/> second <unk w=","/> currency <unk w="of"/> 10 <unk w="%"/> .

Of course , <unk w="the"/> dollar remains king <unk w=","/> global transactions , still providing a safe <unk w="market"/> , but the colossal <unk w="has"/> accumulated <unk w="by"/> the United <unk w="states"/> in <unk w="particular"/> the rest of the world <unk w="to"/> finance <unk w="their"/> lifestyle will increasingly sow the seeds <unk w="of"/> doubt <unk w="and"/> to the ability of the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> one <unk w="of"/> power <unk w="and"/> honour <unk w="and"/> commitments .

<unk w="in"/> fact , the financial world is tending <unk w="into"/> a euro / dollar duopoly .

Any <unk w="of"/> duopoly regularly <unk w="gone"/> through parity adjustments <unk w=","/> often <unk w="too"/> suddenly .

<unk w="in"/> these times of <unk w="worst"/> recession , the <unk w="commission"/> needs <unk w="more"/> and new certainties .

The euro <unk w="will"/> have a <unk w="key"/> role to <unk w="play"/> in <unk w="the"/> new <unk w="economy"/> .

The European Central Bank ( ECB ) <unk w="has"/> done what it <unk w="has"/> to do <unk w="in"/> the face <unk w="of"/> a <unk w="'"/> financial crisis ' <unk w=","/> in the USA ' .

As <unk w="jacques"/> Delors said , <unk w="the"/> euro is <unk w="a"/> shield to <unk w="make"/> the whole <unk w="of"/> Europe , <unk w="and"/> the euro has <unk w="also"/> stimulated the European economy enough so far .

<unk w="in"/> the <unk w="end"/> of the <unk w="council"/> , <unk w="the"/> Commission <unk w="is"/> only a <unk w="few"/> consultant making suggestions <unk w="which"/> are <unk w="very"/> useful , but the real <unk w="political"/> players remain the states themselves which , unfortunately , are <unk w="still"/> in a <unk w="responsible"/> manner .

<unk w="given"/> the effective <unk w="implementation"/> of the cumulative <unk w="nuclear"/> power of <unk w="member"/> states <unk w="to"/> work miracles , the <unk w="commission"/> , in <unk w="spite"/> of the commendable <unk w="nature"/> of <unk w="the"/> Juncker , still only <unk w="have"/> an <unk w="in-depth"/> discussion group .

<unk w="in"/> the spring <unk w="of"/> 1999 , I <unk w="was"/> able to witness the attempt made within the <unk w="commission"/> by a <unk w="european"/> finance <unk w="ministry"/> , including <unk w="the"/> Lafontaine , Dominique Strauss-Kahn , <unk w="the"/> Ciampi and a <unk w="few"/> others , to <unk w="the"/> economic <unk w="and"/> monetary <unk w="union"/> between the <unk w="european"/> Union and <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="central"/> Bank .

Wim <unk w="verheugen"/> made <unk w="the"/> cutting retort : ' there <unk w=","/> will <unk w="be"/> any ex-ante coordination <unk w="between"/> the <unk w="european"/> Central <unk w=","/> as you <unk w="are"/> always going to have to <unk w="be"/> ex-post <unk w="of"/> our decisions . '

<unk w="the"/> reason for this <unk w="is"/> obvious : the <unk w="commission"/> is and will remain <unk w="vigilant"/> in <unk w="developing"/> its monetary <unk w="policy"/> , <unk w="its"/> independence does not <unk w="give"/> a <unk w="report"/> on constructive dialogue between institutions tasked <unk w="and"/> defending the <unk w="best"/> and common destiny <unk w="by"/> 500 <unk w="million"/> Europeans .

There <unk w="is"/> nothing to <unk w="member"/> states from <unk w="getting"/> themselves better with regard to <unk w="the"/> proper coordination of <unk w="the"/> economic <unk w="policy"/> , whether <unk w="it"/> is <unk w="in"/> the EU or <unk w=","/> when representing Europe externally , as Jean-Claude <unk w=","/> so sensibly concluded <unk w="just"/> now .

Mr <unk w="president"/> , Mr <unk w="parish"/> d 'Estaing , Mr Juncker , Mr <unk w="president"/> , Mr Almunia , <unk w="ladies"/> and gentlemen , I find it very regrettable that <unk w="very"/> few Members <unk w="have"/> here <unk w="today"/> for this formal sitting , because <unk w="it"/> really <unk w="is"/> a historic event .

We have <unk w="also"/> heard <unk w="from"/> the <unk w="honourable"/> previous <unk w="shows"/> how much scepticism there <unk w="is"/> when <unk w="the"/> euro <unk w="is"/> first introduced .

<unk w="it"/> was <unk w="said"/> that <unk w="the"/> logistical challenges involved in introducing billions <unk w="of"/> banknotes <unk w="and"/> coins alone would <unk w="be"/> unmanageable , and the <unk w="fact"/> that <unk w="it"/> could combine a <unk w="successful"/> monetary policy with separate fiscal policies <unk w="in"/> the Member States was seen <unk w="not"/> just as a <unk w="political"/> challenge but <unk w="is"/> simply impossible .

European monetary union <unk w="is"/> a <unk w="priority"/> ; the euro <unk w="has"/> been <unk w="in"/> existence for <unk w="many"/> years today .

<unk w="it"/> is <unk w="one"/> of a <unk w="new"/> political <unk w="nature"/> , and once again the <unk w="issue"/> of <unk w="the"/> Hallstein , the <unk w="former"/> President of the Commission , have <unk w="led"/> to <unk w="be"/> true : ' <unk w="people"/> who does not <unk w="live"/> in <unk w="future"/> in European matters <unk w="is"/> not a realist . '

The doubts of the citizens , <unk w="most"/> of whom , in <unk w="the"/> Member <unk w="states"/> , <unk w="i"/> believed that the <unk w="market"/> would result in huge <unk w="political"/> hikes , have now disappeared .

<unk w="the"/> euro <unk w="has"/> now been <unk w="concluded"/> , and even enthusiastically welcomed <unk w="by"/> many citizens .

<unk w="it"/> has become something <unk w="of"/> a visible European identifier : besides the anthem and the flag , <unk w="which"/> is one of <unk w="the"/> few symbols we have today .

<unk w="i"/> could , I think , <unk w="be"/> said <unk w="that"/> , <unk w="that"/> the European Central <unk w="bank"/> 's <unk w="last"/> few years , Europe <unk w=","/> the <unk w="irish"/> economy <unk w="and"/> sailing <unk w="in"/> relatively <unk w="small"/> waters , <unk w="so"/> that the <unk w="have"/> found it pretty easy to pursue a policy of stability .

Even <unk w="now"/> , it <unk w="is"/> worth pointing <unk w="out"/> that <unk w="would"/> mean inflation rate <unk w="in"/> the first 10 years <unk w=","/> the <unk w="eu"/> has been approximately 2 % , <unk w="or"/> other <unk w=","/> more <unk w="or"/> less on <unk w="the"/> target <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="european"/> Central <unk w="bank"/> set itself .

<unk w="the"/> German <unk w="version"/> , <unk w="on"/> the <unk w="other"/> hand , <unk w="which"/> was always held up <unk w="by"/> a poster <unk w="process"/> for stability , had a mean <unk w="a"/> rate of 3 % <unk w="of"/> its 50 <unk w="%"/> of <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> .

It <unk w="would"/> therefore <unk w="be"/> said that <unk w="the"/> European Central Bank has performed very <unk w="carefully"/> .

<unk w="however"/> , <unk w="what"/> is now , in <unk w="the"/> time of crisis , that <unk w="the"/> European Central Bank <unk w="is"/> showing <unk w="its"/> true strength , its true quality .

<unk w="it"/> has proven <unk w="it"/> to be independent , efficient <unk w="and"/> self-confident , and <unk w="legal"/> acts decisively <unk w="so"/> quickly .

It has become an <unk w="illusion"/> for some central banks , both in <unk w="the"/> European countries <unk w="who"/> are not yet part of the euro area and outside Europe .

<unk w="it"/> has made it quite clear to <unk w="the"/> Federal <unk w="reform"/> in the <unk w="member"/> States that it <unk w="can"/> pursue a <unk w="consistent"/> policy , not <unk w="only"/> its independence but precisely <unk w="because"/> it is politically <unk w="motivated"/> and not subject to instructions <unk w="from"/> various <unk w="groups"/> .

<unk w="we"/> now know <unk w="that"/> at <unk w="the"/> moment , <unk w="in"/> the banking sectors <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="individual"/> Member States have been brought <unk w="about"/> a protective <unk w="procedure"/> , the Member States are in <unk w="the"/> process of <unk w="the"/> various economic <unk w="development"/> plans to absorb the negative impact of the <unk w="bse"/> crisis <unk w="and"/> the real <unk w="problem"/> .

<unk w="i"/> will present the <unk w="european"/> Central Bank with further challenges , <unk w="and"/> there is a risk that the differences <unk w="in"/> approach will <unk w="result"/> in <unk w="terms"/> of competition , and that <unk w="is"/> convergence we have , in part , now achieved between the members <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="schengen"/> area <unk w="must"/> be <unk w=","/> and <unk w="we"/> will see <unk w="of"/> divergent developments .

<unk w="it"/> needs to <unk w="be"/> counteracted , which is why it <unk w="is"/> so crucial and so important that <unk w="the"/> Stability <unk w="and"/> Growth <unk w="pact"/> must not <unk w="be"/> undermined or <unk w="not"/> .

<unk w="in"/> the <unk w="first"/> : we must <unk w="ensure"/> that it remains valid .

That <unk w="is"/> why it is <unk w="not"/> so <unk w="important"/> for the necessary structural reforms , <unk w="both"/> the Commission and the European Central <unk w="bank"/> have repeatedly called for in <unk w="the"/> past , actually to <unk w="be"/> pursued <unk w="in"/> the individual Member States .

<unk w="the"/> European <unk w="central"/> Bank will gain a new task <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="coming"/> years .

The <unk w="council"/> has <unk w="told"/> us that we <unk w="have"/> some <unk w="sort"/> of European <unk w="standards"/> of <unk w="the"/> financial market , <unk w="and"/> this <unk w="is"/> an <unk w="area"/> where the <unk w="european"/> Central Bank can <unk w="play"/> a <unk w="significant"/> role .

<unk w="it"/> has signalled <unk w=","/> it is , <unk w="in"/> principle , willing <unk w="to"/> introduce <unk w="any"/> kind <unk w="of"/> central <unk w="european"/> supervisory system analogous to <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="system"/> of <unk w="central"/> Banks .

<unk w="the"/> euro <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> needs <unk w="to"/> speak with one voice , and <unk w="must"/> be <unk w="involved"/> as a unit in <unk w="such"/> organisations such as <unk w="the"/> International <unk w="investment"/> Fund <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="world"/> ( Organisation for <unk w="the"/> Co-operation <unk w="and"/> Development ) .

It <unk w="is"/> still true that a single currency <unk w="is"/> a <unk w="common"/> fiscal <unk w="audiovisual"/> policy is , <unk w="and"/> will continue to be , a <unk w="political"/> undertaking .

<unk w="the"/> EU is still facing some major challenges : <unk w="we"/> are facing <unk w="difficulties"/> , and unfortunately rising , <unk w="out"/> of <unk w="course"/> , <unk w="the"/> changes , migratory <unk w="flows"/> , <unk w="and"/> poverty in <unk w="all"/> sectors of society , and stiffer <unk w=","/> in <unk w="the"/> context of globalisation .

<unk w="the"/> euro <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> will only be able <unk w="to"/> meet these <unk w="requirements"/> if the economic policies of the Member States can be more closely <unk w="involved"/> .

<unk w="the"/> appointment of a president of <unk w="the"/> euro <unk w=","/> was <unk w="the"/> first step in this direction , but it is <unk w="not"/> the first <unk w="problem"/> : more <unk w="to"/> now <unk w="is"/> .

Mr President , <unk w="ladies"/> and <unk w="gentlemen"/> , after <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> years , <unk w="a"/> growing space <unk w="carried"/> out by <unk w="the"/> euro in international trade and its use as a <unk w="european"/> currency <unk w="and"/> that <unk w="it"/> has become a <unk w="good"/> benchmark .

It <unk w="has"/> guaranteed monetary stability and has helped integrate the <unk w="laws"/> of <unk w="the"/> Member States that have adopted <unk w="them"/> , despite some <unk w="sort"/> of <unk w="those"/> that created problems for citizens <unk w=","/> because of <unk w="an"/> actual exchange <unk w="rate"/> between <unk w="the"/> currencies and the euro and because of the few <unk w="projects"/> subsequently carried out <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="transport"/> of goods and services .

<unk w="the"/> euro <unk w="mostly"/> created without being <unk w="removed"/> from <unk w="uranium"/> and without <unk w="the"/> wars of conquest <unk w="and"/> political <unk w="prisoners"/> .

It was <unk w="the"/> result of <unk w="the"/> free <unk w="states"/> together of 11 governments who <unk w=","/> in the <unk w="field"/> of <unk w="the"/> economic and monetary <unk w="union"/> , as laid down <unk w="in"/> the Treaties , as an essential step in <unk w="order"/> to <unk w="make"/> the <unk w="european"/> union <unk w="but"/> still unfortunately remains out of our grasp .

Some <unk w="of"/> that <unk w="have"/> occurred <unk w="in"/> due <unk w="to"/> inefficiencies in a <unk w="way"/> that <unk w="is"/> unprepared for the task of guiding the other <unk w="topics"/> associated <unk w="countries"/> ; I <unk w="am"/> talking about the increasing <unk w="number"/> of <unk w="women"/> and the <unk w="necessary"/> changes in the way trade is conducted at international level .

<unk w="the"/> euro has made it possible to face <unk w="itself"/> to a <unk w="series"/> of difficulties , <unk w="the"/> most <unk w="important"/> of which is <unk w="the"/> current <unk w="economic"/> crisis , <unk w="but"/> it <unk w="is"/> protected <unk w="and"/> against the great <unk w="extent"/> that <unk w="the"/> ravaged <unk w="of"/> markets .

Were <unk w="it"/> not <unk w="only"/> the <unk w="case"/> , we <unk w="still"/> have <unk w="had"/> the experience <unk w="of"/> 1992 , <unk w="even"/> worse .

We <unk w="deplore"/> this 10th <unk w="report"/> by <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> welcoming the <unk w="liberty"/> of Slovakia , the <unk w="basque"/> country to <unk w="make"/> the euro area .

<unk w="the"/> measures <unk w="proposed"/> by <unk w="the"/> European Central <unk w="bank"/> ( <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> ) and the <unk w="measures"/> to combat the <unk w="bse"/> crisis <unk w="and"/> acted <unk w="in"/> a buffer and a form <unk w="of"/> containment <unk w=","/> we still <unk w="have"/> , <unk w="as"/> we <unk w="have"/> often done in <unk w="this"/> Chamber , <unk w="but"/> we <unk w="find"/> it inconceivable <unk w="to"/> have a monetary <unk w="policy"/> disconnected from economic <unk w="policy"/> .

Admittedly , <unk w="the"/> actual <unk w="purpose"/> is somewhat <unk w="clear"/> : 16 <unk w="member"/> States with <unk w="a"/> single <unk w="market"/> , <unk w="the"/> national <unk w="community"/> policies coordinated <unk w="by"/> the Commission as well as <unk w="they"/> can , <unk w="in"/> 11 Member States with <unk w="national"/> currencies .

Coordinating a <unk w="common"/> policy with an economic policy <unk w="which"/> does <unk w="not"/> actually exist <unk w=","/> certainly <unk w="not"/> mean <unk w="that"/> , <unk w="even"/> if the institutions <unk w="are"/> for economic <unk w="growth"/> in <unk w="our"/> countries <unk w="do"/> not communicate with <unk w="the"/> central banks <unk w="and"/> the ECB , which has to <unk w="bring"/> all <unk w="its"/> policies together , and <unk w="vice"/> versa , <unk w="the"/> European Union will find <unk w="the"/> difficulties in jointly facing up <unk w="to"/> the current crisis and also the <unk w="new"/> challenges <unk w="of"/> the outside <unk w="world"/> and <unk w="to"/> bring home to us .

We hope that recent experiences <unk w="of"/> people <unk w="have"/> the <unk w="need"/> to <unk w="set"/> up <unk w="a"/> change <unk w="in"/> Europe , <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="irish"/> economy to <unk w="the"/> centre <unk w="for"/> ensuring better <unk w="protection"/> and <unk w="coordination"/> between the <unk w="eu"/> and the <unk w="european"/> institutions <unk w=","/> for laying down political and planning strategy .

The very recent energy <unk w="committee"/> has also shown <unk w="itself"/> that a common <unk w="fisheries"/> policy on the <unk w="new"/> strategic topics <unk w="are"/> of vital <unk w="importance"/> to <unk w="the"/> public and <unk w="cannot"/> be delayed .

If the political <unk w="solution"/> is <unk w="concerned"/> , <unk w="the"/> introduction <unk w="of"/> such a policy will be <unk w="accompanied"/> by <unk w="the"/> growing power <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="eu"/> .

<unk w="mr"/> President , <unk w="the"/> Giscard d <unk w="burg"/> , Mr <unk w="president-in-office"/> , <unk w="and"/> Trichet , Commissioner , ladies and <unk w="gentlemen"/> , I <unk w="would"/> like <unk w="to"/> remind you <unk w="that"/> , in 1992 , <unk w="that"/> it was still <unk w="very"/> dubious as <unk w="to"/> whether <unk w="the"/> French would vote in <unk w="favour"/> of the Maastricht <unk w="treaty"/> , Jacques Delors spoke to <unk w="the"/> general <unk w="availability"/> of the <unk w="nordic"/> Green Party , <unk w="has"/> managed <unk w="to"/> deliver <unk w="a"/> missing 1 % or 2 % .

<unk w="you"/> said <unk w="to"/> us : ' <unk w="respect"/> for the euro , then we <unk w="must"/> have a political Europe , <unk w="even"/> if we <unk w="do"/> not create a political <unk w="solution"/> to <unk w="protect"/> Europe , <unk w="and"/> people will <unk w="not"/> accept it ; <unk w="we"/> will never accept it . '

<unk w="the"/> Maastricht Treaty <unk w="was"/> approved , but no political <unk w="solution"/> was <unk w="made"/> .

This is the <unk w="only"/> problem which <unk w="we"/> are facing <unk w="today"/> .

Firstly , <unk w="it"/> seemed <unk w="to"/> us that the <unk w="political"/> criteria were <unk w="designed"/> to <unk w="integrate"/> Europe into <unk w="at"/> least five <unk w="years"/> of <unk w="the"/> recessionary policy and , secondly , the <unk w="way"/> in which <unk w="the"/> monetary <unk w="union"/> was <unk w="moved"/> into <unk w="the"/> general <unk w="agricultural"/> policy by the Maastricht Treaty <unk w="does"/> not <unk w="observed"/> .

For the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of the <unk w="european"/> Central Bank <unk w="of"/> independence , <unk w="which"/> would separate <unk w="competition"/> policy from <unk w="the"/> rest <unk w="of"/> the policies .

I must <unk w="say"/> quite honestly <unk w="that"/> , even if I am still <unk w="not"/> convinced by <unk w="the"/> Maastricht Treaty <unk w="and"/> , like all <unk w="the"/> other <unk w="things"/> , I <unk w="am"/> rather <unk w="disappointed"/> by <unk w="the"/> changes <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="scope"/> and application <unk w="of"/> Economic and <unk w="monetary"/> Union have undergone .

Firstly , <unk w="relative"/> stability has been <unk w="defined"/> at a level <unk w="of"/> slightly less than , <unk w="very"/> close to , 2 % .

<unk w="in"/> the <unk w="commission"/> , <unk w="and"/> the world is being threatened by deflation <unk w="that"/> the situation is being <unk w="caused"/> by <unk w="the"/> tendency of <unk w="third"/> countries to <unk w="have"/> cut their VAT rate <unk w="as"/> part <unk w="of"/> a <unk w="foreign"/> policy , it is obvious that setting <unk w="a"/> target of 2 % is no longer just <unk w="to"/> show .

<unk w="if"/> we <unk w="have"/> to keep <unk w="up"/> this 2 % target we <unk w="run"/> the risk <unk w="of"/> having very <unk w="little"/> real interest <unk w="is"/> being <unk w="here"/> on us .

The second <unk w="major"/> reform <unk w="is"/> obviously <unk w="the"/> reform of the Stability <unk w="and"/> Growth <unk w="is"/> carried <unk w="out"/> in 2005 , which allows us today <unk w="to"/> have a policy that is contracyclical and <unk w="aimed"/> at countering <unk w="the"/> crisis .

The third major transformation is <unk w="to"/> change to <unk w="the"/> things <unk w="wrong"/> in <unk w="future"/> .

This <unk w="gradual"/> dialogue , as <unk w="we"/> once again <unk w="in"/> this Chamber , between Mr <unk w="swoboda"/> , <unk w="mr"/> Almunia , <unk w="the"/> Juncker <unk w=","/> Mr Barroso , <unk w="who"/> , <unk w="economically"/> speaking , <unk w="according"/> to the Maastricht Treaty itself .

I regard this form <unk w="of"/> cooperation <unk w=","/> Mr Trichet <unk w=","/> Mr Almunia , for example , to be <unk w="the"/> equivalent of <unk w="the"/> between <unk w="the"/> Bernanke <unk w="and"/> Mr <unk w="costa"/> , which <unk w="is"/> a positive and desirable development .

All I would say is <unk w="that"/> we need <unk w="to"/> apply properly <unk w="in"/> good <unk w="practices"/> of the <unk w="maastricht"/> Treaty .

We have a real problem in <unk w="transposing"/> the exchange <unk w="rate"/> , which <unk w="has"/> been mentioned on <unk w="many"/> occasions by my predecessors .

The task <unk w="of"/> setting the <unk w="interest"/> rate is <unk w="due"/> to <unk w="the"/> Council .

We <unk w="must"/> find the means to ensure that the <unk w="commission"/> sets an exchange rate for <unk w="us"/> which does <unk w="not"/> derive <unk w="away"/> from the interest <unk w="rate"/> chosen by <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="central"/> Bank , but <unk w="it"/> reflects an industrial policy .

Secondly , <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="central"/> Bank <unk w="'s"/> objective <unk w="is"/> not <unk w="only"/> to maintain a <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> close to 2 % but <unk w="also"/> to apply Europe <unk w="'s"/> policy , <unk w="and"/> that I <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> the <unk w="future"/> and <unk w="future"/> Strategies .

We <unk w="have"/> to <unk w="have"/> a <unk w="need"/> for refinancing and rediscounting private debts <unk w="by"/> the <unk w="european"/> Central Bank <unk w="prior"/> to the Gothenburg and Lisbon Strategies .

<unk w="however"/> , <unk w="as"/> has <unk w="already"/> been mentioned , there needs <unk w="to"/> be supervision at a European level and the <unk w="european"/> Central Bank <unk w="is"/> in <unk w="the"/> best position to <unk w="achieve"/> this function .

<unk w="it"/> is regrettable that <unk w="we"/> are <unk w="now"/> taking advantage of <unk w="the"/> opportunity for an in-depth examination of the consequences of implementing <unk w="terrorism"/> and monetarist <unk w="measures"/> - using <unk w="the"/> euro <unk w="as"/> an <unk w="area"/> - <unk w="we"/> have <unk w="led"/> to the <unk w="'"/> serious social situation and <unk w="of"/> increasing inequality , unemployment , precarious and poorly paid <unk w="out"/> , and poverty .

<unk w="it"/> is <unk w="something"/> that <unk w="we"/> are <unk w="forced"/> onto <unk w="the"/> dogmas , <unk w="such"/> as price stability and the irrational criteria of <unk w="the"/> Stability <unk w="and"/> Growth Pact , which <unk w="is"/> being used as a <unk w="pretext"/> in order to <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> privatisation and remove responsibility for social <unk w="protection"/> from <unk w="the"/> state .

<unk w="this"/> approach <unk w="also"/> involves the <unk w="inclusion"/> of the minimal state <unk w="and"/> the greater efficiency of the <unk w="fisheries"/> sector , with the aim of imposing acceptance of so-called wage <unk w="law"/> , which <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> results in <unk w="negotiations"/> , nominal wage rises and even a <unk w="reduction"/> in real <unk w="terms"/> , as the Portuguese case regrettably clearly <unk w="said"/> .

We cannot <unk w="agree"/> with <unk w="the"/> false independence of the <unk w="european"/> Central <unk w="bank"/> , <unk w="which"/> is <unk w="still"/> its <unk w="emphasis"/> on <unk w="political"/> decisions to <unk w="reduce"/> interest rates and <unk w="it"/> is keeping the <unk w="right"/> overvalued <unk w=","/> to <unk w="all"/> those countries with <unk w="the"/> developed economies <unk w="and"/> the more powerful economic and financial groups , thus <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> the hardships <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="most"/> fragile economies and those <unk w="working"/> with <unk w="the"/> financial resources .

<unk w="the"/> European Central <unk w="fisheries"/> policy has resulted in <unk w="the"/> contraction of the European <unk w="union"/> , <unk w="thereby"/> demonstrating <unk w="the"/> need for further reductions <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="various"/> interest rates .

As the purchasing power <unk w="of"/> workers , the retired and <unk w="who"/> has <unk w="been"/> over the <unk w="last"/> 10 years , the <unk w="lack"/> of economic <unk w="and"/> financial <unk w="interests"/> have <unk w="set"/> their highest level in <unk w="recent"/> years , <unk w="both"/> in the <unk w="future"/> and <unk w="so"/> that we have heard in <unk w="this"/> Chamber .

Even now , <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="current"/> situation that they have caused , what they are <unk w="doing"/> is <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="world"/> in order <unk w=","/> then <unk w="increase"/> the profits , whilst <unk w="others"/> , micro- and small entrepreneurs , <unk w="the"/> retired and the <unk w="elderly"/> suffer the consequences of <unk w="this"/> crisis , with the <unk w="commission"/> , in the <unk w="case"/> scenario , only to a few scraps .

<unk w="what"/> at <unk w="present"/> is happening in <unk w="the"/> financial sector , <unk w="and"/> certain banks have already <unk w="had"/> their spreads <unk w="rather"/> than <unk w="ever"/> since <unk w="the"/> start <unk w="of"/> the financial crisis <unk w=","/> where the margin charged has <unk w="arisen"/> in the space <unk w="of"/> a year , thereby <unk w="making"/> new <unk w="and"/> even more .

We therefore insist <unk w="that"/> the urgent need <unk w="for"/> a proper break with <unk w="the"/> neoliberal and <unk w="national"/> policies , putting an <unk w="end"/> to the Stability Pact , <unk w="tax"/> havens <unk w="and"/> the false <unk w="dream"/> of <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="central"/> Bank .

<unk w="we"/> therefore insist <unk w="on"/> the need <unk w="for"/> significantly <unk w="reduce"/> the EU budget based on a <unk w="fairer"/> distribution of income <unk w="and"/> wealth , so <unk w="that"/> there is a real <unk w="lack"/> of economic <unk w="and"/> social cohesion and so that <unk w="we"/> reject measures that <unk w="are"/> just more of <unk w="the"/> same , <unk w="the"/> other <unk w="people"/> ' save yourself <unk w=","/> you <unk w="are"/> ' <unk w="time"/> , <unk w="for"/> the <unk w="largest"/> to become <unk w="a"/> richer <unk w="of"/> the poor to become ever poorer , as clearly <unk w="defined"/> by <unk w="the"/> increasing inequalities <unk w="and"/> disparities <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="free-trade"/> area <unk w="too"/> .

We therefore <unk w="insist"/> on <unk w="the"/> need to support <unk w="them"/> and <unk w="democracy"/> , <unk w="small"/> and <unk w="medium-sized"/> enterprises ; to promote quality public services ; to facilitate credit <unk w="to"/> improve the purchasing <unk w="use"/> of <unk w="consumers"/> , <unk w="and"/> not just the most <unk w="importantly"/> , <unk w="but"/> also <unk w="in"/> middle <unk w="east"/> ; to create more <unk w="insecurity"/> , and to reduce <unk w="the"/> poverty and <unk w="lack"/> of <unk w="freedom"/> of <unk w="women"/> in <unk w="third"/> countries .

<unk w="on"/> behalf of the IND / DEM <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> . - Mr President , do enjoy <unk w="the"/> 10th birthday of the euro because I very <unk w="much"/> doubt you <unk w="will"/> be <unk w="in"/> the 20th .

What we have seen this morning <unk w="has"/> been <unk w="part"/> of the <unk w="former"/> Soviet times .

<unk w="do"/> you remember <unk w="that"/> the five-year plans were announced to be <unk w="so"/> often before they <unk w="were"/> even launched , <unk w="so"/> much talk <unk w="on"/> record <unk w=","/> and <unk w="the"/> production <unk w="methods"/> for <unk w="example"/> ?

<unk w="just"/> like those <unk w="else"/> , we <unk w="have"/> been <unk w="discussing"/> this morning to a succession of <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , <unk w="and"/> bureaucrats <unk w="told"/> us <unk w="as"/> a great success the whole <unk w="process"/> has <unk w="done"/> .

<unk w="the"/> idea that <unk w="the"/> ECB has done a good job <unk w="as"/> extraordinary .

<unk w="it"/> was <unk w="in"/> July when the European <unk w="central"/> Bank <unk w="on"/> interest rates up , <unk w="and"/> at the <unk w="very"/> moment <unk w="in"/> the markets <unk w="is"/> going into <unk w=","/> and rates were <unk w="also"/> slashed across the rest of <unk w="the"/> world .

Of <unk w="course"/> none <unk w="of"/> this surprises <unk w=","/> because what this euro <unk w="is"/> all <unk w="possible"/> is a political <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> imposing <unk w="political"/> will upon the peoples of Europe .

<unk w="given"/> that only <unk w="two"/> countries - Denmark and <unk w="denmark"/> - <unk w="is"/> a <unk w="position"/> on the <unk w="ground"/> and <unk w="one"/> of them said ' no ' , <unk w="a"/> little word <unk w=","/> you try <unk w="to"/> avoid <unk w="what"/> you <unk w="possibly"/> can .

<unk w="the"/> euro zone has never been tested <unk w="as"/> it <unk w="is"/> about to <unk w="us"/> .

Italy , as <unk w="regards"/> economists <unk w=","/> the <unk w="case"/> said , <unk w="i"/> never have joined the <unk w="commission"/> , but <unk w="the"/> situation <unk w="in"/> Greece is , I <unk w="believe"/> , <unk w="that"/> we <unk w="must"/> focus our <unk w="attention"/> .

Thousands of young <unk w="people"/> out on <unk w="the"/> streets demonstrating , demanding their <unk w="view"/> does something , demanding that their government <unk w="interest"/> rates , demanding <unk w="by"/> their government <unk w="operates"/> .

<unk w="if"/> the <unk w="british"/> Government is <unk w="the"/> inside <unk w="and"/> euro straitjacket .

There <unk w="is"/> nothing that a <unk w="more"/> general <unk w="interest"/> can do <unk w="with"/> Greece <unk w="to"/> change anything .

When people have <unk w="taken"/> away from <unk w="all"/> the <unk w="right"/> to <unk w="achieve"/> their own <unk w="identity"/> through <unk w="the"/> ballot box , then I am afraid that violence <unk w="is"/> the only logical alternative .

What you have <unk w="dealt"/> with <unk w="the"/> euro is you have <unk w="become"/> people <unk w="as"/> an economic <unk w="sector"/> .

You have <unk w="had"/> people <unk w="received"/> a <unk w="view"/> from <unk w="doing"/> it <unk w="would"/> take great courage to <unk w="carry"/> out .

<unk w="we"/> will take leadership , <unk w="and"/> possibly the inevitable <unk w="of"/> meltdown .

You can boo , <unk w="i"/> can <unk w="say"/> , but <unk w="do"/> this : Britain outside of the euro <unk w="has"/> been able to devalue , <unk w="have"/> been able <unk w="to"/> slash <unk w="interest"/> rates .

We <unk w="have"/> been able <unk w="to"/> do the <unk w="things"/> that we need to do .

<unk w="but"/> on if <unk w="you"/> like , but <unk w="do"/> you <unk w="say"/> that <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="energy"/> markets <unk w="this"/> morning Greek <unk w="who"/> are trading <unk w="the"/> basis <unk w="for"/> higher <unk w="or"/> German <unk w="farmers"/> ?

<unk w="what"/> I know <unk w="the"/> most <unk w="of"/> you <unk w="know"/> this <unk w="house"/> will not even <unk w="do"/> what that means and those that <unk w="they"/> will do their best <unk w="and"/> ignore it .

<unk w="we"/> can <unk w="count"/> on <unk w="what"/> your <unk w="career"/> in the sand if you <unk w="are"/> .

You can ignore the markets if <unk w="we"/> want to , but <unk w="this"/> time <unk w="these"/> markets will <unk w="not"/> ignore you .

Mr <unk w="president"/> , in the <unk w="last"/> 200 years <unk w="would"/> have <unk w=","/> at least half a dozen <unk w="ago"/> to create single <unk w="market"/> or fixed exchange rate <unk w="mechanism"/> .

<unk w="we"/> have failed , all have damaged the participants , <unk w="and"/> so <unk w="it"/> is with <unk w="the"/> euro .

<unk w="the"/> imbalances <unk w="are"/> predicted by sceptics are starting to bite .

Spain 's <unk w="example"/> is like <unk w="a"/> bull <unk w="in"/> the corrida : proud <unk w="a"/> strong <unk w="to"/> start with , <unk w="the"/> bleeding <unk w="and"/> death <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="coast"/> by the end .

Greece <unk w="in"/> recent <unk w="years"/> is clearly <unk w="devoted"/> to unemployment , <unk w="resulting"/> from <unk w="the"/> overvalued euro .

<unk w="the"/> spreads <unk w=","/> Greece <unk w="and"/> Germany have <unk w="reached"/> unprecedented levels - over <unk w="the"/> basis points .

We <unk w="in"/> Britain <unk w="must"/> thank heaven that we <unk w="lose"/> our <unk w="european"/> currency and are not <unk w="part"/> of <unk w="the"/> euro zone <unk w="in"/> slow-motion train wreck .

<unk w="in"/> writing . - <unk w="the"/> tenth anniversary <unk w="of"/> the vote on the <unk w="report"/> , <unk w="according"/> to <unk w="say"/> , on behalf <unk w="of"/> the Council <unk w="of"/> Ministers , by Gordon <unk w="parliament"/> ( then <unk w=","/> of the <unk w="treaty"/> ) , to lock <unk w="interest"/> rates <unk w="at"/> that day <unk w=","/> level and <unk w="to"/> create the euro , is <unk w="an"/> opportunity to <unk w="find"/> ten <unk w="years"/> of <unk w="peace"/> , stability <unk w="and"/> strength <unk w="and"/> what <unk w="is"/> now one <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="other"/> leading currencies in <unk w="the"/> world .

The <unk w="european"/> economic crisis <unk w="would"/> have <unk w="been"/> compounded <unk w="and"/> turmoil on currency <unk w="and"/> had we <unk w="always"/> had the <unk w="opportunity"/> , <unk w="however"/> , drachma and <unk w="so"/> on as <unk w="other"/> currencies fluctuating <unk w="and"/> against <unk w="each"/> other .

<unk w="the"/> euro has been a rock of <unk w="respect"/> for its members , <unk w="is"/> illustrated by <unk w="the"/> contrasting fortunes of Iceland <unk w="and"/> Ireland .

The anniversary is also <unk w="an"/> opportunity to <unk w="consider"/> whether <unk w="turkey"/> 's long-term economic future lies with euro <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> .

Of <unk w="course"/> , <unk w="we"/> can manage in <unk w="the"/> short run outside the <unk w="world"/> , but over <unk w="them"/> , we stand <unk w="to"/> lose out : <unk w="small"/> businesses <unk w="are"/> handicapped in the <unk w="world"/> market by <unk w="the"/> costs and <unk w="the"/> costs that <unk w="their"/> competitors <unk w="know"/> that <unk w="they"/> do not <unk w="live"/> ; <unk w="they"/> inward <unk w="it"/> into the European market will prefer <unk w="to"/> be in <unk w="a"/> major currency area rather than the <unk w="previous"/> one .

The formal sitting <unk w="of"/> the European Parliament marking the <unk w="50th"/> anniversary of Economic <unk w="and"/> Monetary <unk w="union"/> ( EMU ) <unk w="is"/> a <unk w="series"/> of <unk w="the"/> crisis in <unk w="a"/> capitalist <unk w="process"/> follows <unk w="both"/> resolutions and reports by <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="parliament"/> on the same <unk w="matter"/> and is yet another attempt <unk w="to"/> gild <unk w="the"/> pill of <unk w="the"/> anti-grassroots , <unk w="the"/> policy <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="commission"/> which , <unk w="in"/> the demise of socialism , <unk w="led"/> to the Maastricht <unk w="treaty"/> and its all-out attack on <unk w="human"/> rights and freedoms .

EMU , the establishment <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="european"/> Central Bank and <unk w="the"/> launch of the euro are necessary links <unk w="in"/> the chain <unk w="of"/> capitalist restructurings being promoted <unk w="on"/> capital <unk w="in"/> order <unk w="to"/> defend <unk w="them"/> against workers ' <unk w="rights"/> and <unk w="enshrined"/> its <unk w="commitment"/> by stepping up <unk w="the"/> exploitation of <unk w="the"/> working <unk w="classes"/> and <unk w="social"/> classes .

The arguments about price stability , reducing inflation and <unk w="national"/> economies from <unk w="the"/> and crisis have proven <unk w="to"/> be stale <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .

<unk w="it"/> protects the <unk w="interests"/> of the <unk w="market"/> and <unk w="the"/> privatisation <unk w="of"/> merger .

This past decade , workers <unk w="have"/> seen <unk w="their"/> incomes <unk w="and"/> , <unk w="and"/> relations <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , their insurance rights evaporate and health <unk w=","/> education services <unk w=")"/> and made into privatised commodities .

<unk w="we"/> reject <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> street and <unk w="its"/> supporters , and also the <unk w="lisbon"/> Strategy and the <unk w="maastricht"/> Treaty , and are fighting against <unk w="terrorism"/> and <unk w="the"/> EU itself for <unk w="its"/> power and a <unk w="new"/> economy .

In <unk w="this"/> debate <unk w="on"/> the euro I want <unk w="to"/> draw attention to <unk w="the"/> negative <unk w="effects"/> of its performance .

<unk w="however"/> , from <unk w="the"/> moment <unk w=","/> the euro was <unk w="still"/> , in other words from 2002 to <unk w="the"/> inclusive , <unk w="the"/> three Member States which <unk w="are"/> outside <unk w="the"/> euro area ( <unk w="finland"/> , Sweden and <unk w="denmark"/> ) developed faster than the countries which were in the euro area .

Gross <unk w="domestic"/> income in those <unk w="countries"/> grew almost twice as fast as the average for the euro <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> , <unk w="at"/> the level <unk w="of"/> unemployment was <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .

Secondly , the <unk w="problem"/> with the effects of the current financial and <unk w="economic"/> crisis is clearly <unk w="more"/> effective in those <unk w="ways"/> than in the euro area .

The <unk w="central"/> banks of England , Sweden <unk w="and"/> Denmark <unk w="very"/> quickly and clearly <unk w="an"/> interest <unk w=","/> while ensuring liquidity <unk w="national"/> commercial banks .

It also seems that <unk w="a"/> fiscal policy <unk w="pursued"/> by <unk w="developing"/> countries will <unk w="be"/> more effective than the <unk w="audiovisual"/> policy <unk w="in"/> the euro area .

<unk w="however"/> , <unk w="the"/> Member <unk w="states"/> which <unk w="are"/> preparing to <unk w="make"/> the euro area <unk w=","/> to comply with many monetary and fiscal criteria <unk w="for"/> years <unk w="of"/> entry .

Some of <unk w="these"/> criteria are mutually <unk w="disproportionate"/> , such <unk w="as"/> the need to be present in the ERM II system - and therefore <unk w="we"/> need to maintain the <unk w="single"/> currency <unk w="and"/> exchange rate against the euro within a <unk w="modern"/> band <unk w="of"/> ± <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> % - and <unk w="on"/> the same <unk w="way"/> to <unk w="guarantee"/> a low level of inflation .

Counteracting devaluation pressure on the <unk w="single"/> currency means the need <unk w="for"/> intervention by central banks , <unk w="which"/> means <unk w="of"/> greater amounts of the national currency <unk w="in"/> circulation , <unk w="thereby"/> obviously increases inflationary pressure .

<unk w="if"/> the <unk w="commission"/> wants to encourage new <unk w="member"/> States , <unk w="we"/> should <unk w="be"/> eliminating <unk w="the"/> obvious inconsistency .

<unk w="mr"/> President , <unk w="ladies"/> and gentlemen , European Economic and <unk w="monetary"/> Union <unk w=","/> on 1 January 1999 , and 11 EU <unk w="member"/> States adopted the single currency at the same time .

The euro was <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> years old <unk w=","/> 1 <unk w="and"/> 2009 .

<unk w="at"/> the same time , <unk w="it"/> became the 16th <unk w=","/> to <unk w="achieve"/> the <unk w="balkans"/> .

Just <unk w="as"/> Mr Juncker stated <unk w="by"/> Parliament in <unk w="his"/> speech , the <unk w="commission"/> is <unk w="almost"/> definitely <unk w="the"/> ' <unk w="lack"/> of <unk w="all"/> ' .

This is something <unk w="for"/> countries that <unk w="have"/> been <unk w="carried"/> out of the <unk w="free-trade"/> area have <unk w="been"/> made <unk w="fully"/> aware of .

Although the <unk w="50th"/> anniversary of the euro <unk w="is"/> overshadowed <unk w="by"/> worries <unk w="by"/> a <unk w="gross"/> deepening of <unk w="the"/> recession , I trust in the euro <unk w="area"/> 's <unk w="ability"/> to emerge <unk w="from"/> the <unk w="future"/> .

This <unk w="will"/> nevertheless require considerable effort <unk w="on"/> the part <unk w="of"/> the Union .

<unk w="according"/> to the latest estimates , <unk w="the"/> effect of the agreed stimulus <unk w=","/> will be considerably less <unk w="than"/> the 1.5 % of gross <unk w="domestic"/> product planned for <unk w="this"/> area .

The <unk w="eu"/> has been an unquestionable success , <unk w="it"/> would not have been but <unk w="that"/> the <unk w="considerable"/> efforts made .

Now <unk w="we"/> need to strengthen <unk w="parliament"/> 's role in the supervision of the <unk w="financial"/> markets .

<unk w="we"/> have to keep to <unk w="the"/> basic principles <unk w="and"/> criteria of Economic and Monetary Union .

On 1 January 2009 <unk w="the"/> euro <unk w=","/> the <unk w="european"/> currency <unk w="and"/> Slovakia .

<unk w="from"/> that date , the <unk w="red"/> cross on three hills <unk w=","/> the Slovak flag <unk w="is"/> also <unk w="imposed"/> on one-euro <unk w=","/> two-euro <unk w=","/> and has <unk w="been"/> put <unk w="into"/> circulation across the euro area .

That day <unk w=","/> a <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> moment <unk w="in"/> Slovakia <unk w=","/> we Slovaks are <unk w="very"/> proud to be the first country from <unk w="the"/> former Socialist <unk w="republic"/> to introduce the euro in this symbolic <unk w="proportion"/> of the 10th anniversary <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="schengen"/> area .

I <unk w="would"/> appreciative <unk w="that"/> the fact <unk w="that"/> the <unk w="european"/> Slovak <unk w="which"/> has subscribed to the commitment of <unk w="the"/> Dzurinda , <unk w="de"/> cabinet , in <unk w="march"/> 2004 , <unk w="is"/> a plan <unk w="to"/> replace the <unk w="agreement"/> with the European currency and <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="age"/> of 2009 as <unk w="a"/> target date .

It <unk w="also"/> seems <unk w="to"/> here <unk w="that"/> the floor of the EP to thank <unk w="the"/> Slovak people because it was <unk w="not"/> , <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="various"/> actors in the <unk w="atlantic"/> but <unk w="the"/> ' <unk w="s"/> ' reforms , <unk w="the"/> persevered and <unk w="lifelong"/> Slovakia <unk w="has"/> become a <unk w="great"/> European <unk w="union"/> .

From 1 January 2009 the euro will link the <unk w="issue"/> of Slovakia to the <unk w="eu"/> every day .

The introduction <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="european"/> single <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> 10 <unk w="years"/> ago marked <unk w="the"/> completion <unk w="of"/> a process whose <unk w="will"/> go far <unk w="beyond"/> the economic sector .

<unk w="the"/> finalisation of <unk w="the"/> Economic <unk w="and"/> Monetary Union process <unk w="the"/> Member States ' commitment to safeguard <unk w="the"/> EU <unk w="'s"/> economic and political unity .

<unk w="the"/> euro 's success <unk w="also"/> means success in the process <unk w="by"/> building an entity designed to promote <unk w="the"/> values <unk w="of"/> international <unk w="law"/> and confirm the European Union as the <unk w="largest"/> player in <unk w="economic"/> and financial relations <unk w="with"/> the <unk w="irish"/> economy .

I <unk w="believe"/> that the benefits <unk w="provided"/> by <unk w="converting"/> the euro , involving macroeconomic <unk w="cooperation"/> , a <unk w="dramatic"/> reduction in price fluctuations , the promotion of <unk w="artistic"/> creation and <unk w=","/> for productivity <unk w="reduction"/> , <unk w="are"/> underpinned by <unk w="the"/> resistance <unk w="to"/> external shocks , justify all the <unk w="efforts"/> made by <unk w="the"/> new Member States , especially Romania , <unk w="to"/> meet the <unk w="copenhagen"/> criteria <unk w="as"/> soon as <unk w="possible"/> and <unk w="in"/> the euro area .

Since <unk w="the"/> euro was launched <unk w="on"/> 1 <unk w="december"/> 1999 , <unk w="the"/> single currency <unk w="has"/> , <unk w="in"/> many <unk w="years"/> , proven to <unk w="be"/> an important factor in <unk w="the"/> stability of the EU <unk w="itself"/> .

<unk w="the"/> single currency is , first <unk w="of"/> all , a <unk w="driving"/> force for <unk w="stock"/> exchanges : the <unk w="question"/> of exchange rates <unk w=","/> the euro <unk w=","/> is <unk w="very"/> important and <unk w="to"/> benefit for citizens , and promotes mobility <unk w="within"/> the EU .

In addition to <unk w="the"/> obvious benefits , <unk w="the"/> euro <unk w="is"/> also <unk w="serve"/> as an <unk w="increase"/> in the <unk w="bse"/> crisis .

<unk w="as"/> a major currency <unk w=","/> by <unk w="the"/> Member States <unk w="and"/> national <unk w="parliaments"/> is able to cushion the dramatic effects <unk w="of"/> economic <unk w="growth"/> .

Monetary union <unk w="says"/> that <unk w="the"/> levers can <unk w="be"/> applied <unk w="at"/> international level and active responses can be <unk w="given"/> to <unk w="the"/> financial <unk w="management"/> .

Finally , though , <unk w="the"/> euro is also a symbol <unk w="of"/> European integration and <unk w="a"/> long road that the <unk w="palestinian"/> people have <unk w="already"/> travelled together .

Monetary union is the <unk w="only"/> logical step after <unk w="the"/> union , and <unk w="we"/> also <unk w="paved"/> the way for deeper European <unk w="integration"/> .

<unk w="just"/> one year ago , when marking the 10th <unk w="declaration"/> of the creation <unk w="of"/> the European Central Bank ( ECB ) and <unk w="economic"/> and Monetary <unk w="union"/> ( EMU ) , <unk w="has"/> highlighted <unk w="the"/> fact <unk w="is"/> : ' <unk w="in"/> the ten <unk w="years"/> it has <unk w=","/> in <unk w="fact"/> , the results <unk w="achieved"/> by EMU <unk w="is"/> a resounding success . '

I <unk w="believe"/> that this <unk w="report"/> is quite appropriate as I <unk w="am"/> a <unk w="great"/> believer in <unk w="the"/> importance <unk w="of"/> the solidarity which <unk w="member"/> States need to show in their <unk w="own"/> actions to <unk w="improve"/> the <unk w="distortion"/> of the financial crisis and <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> the adverse impact of the global economic crisis .

Europe <unk w="is"/> in <unk w="the"/> most precarious economic situation <unk w="at"/> the end <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="second"/> World War .

<unk w="in"/> this <unk w="context"/> , marking <unk w="the"/> 10th anniversary <unk w="of"/> the introduction of the euro must refocus <unk w="drawn"/> attention on the major European <unk w="union"/> projects .

The introduction <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="european"/> single <unk w="market"/> and <unk w="the"/> creation of <unk w="changes"/> were <unk w="the"/> decisions made through harmonisation and solidarity based <unk w="on"/> European values .

This <unk w="is"/> the kind of attitude <unk w="that"/> we <unk w="will"/> need this <unk w="situation"/> in <unk w="order"/> to <unk w="implement"/> and <unk w="to"/> implement measures to <unk w="improve"/> the financial <unk w="markets"/> .

Europe <unk w="'s"/> competitiveness <unk w="continues"/> to <unk w="be"/> maintained within <unk w="the"/> euro area <unk w=","/> must be boosted in Member <unk w="states"/> which <unk w="are"/> preparing <unk w="to"/> join <unk w="the"/> euro <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> .

Furthermore , <unk w="the"/> members ' diverse interests must take secondary priority to the EU 's common economic <unk w="policy"/> .

Madam President , I have been <unk w="trying"/> to <unk w="speak"/> to <unk w="be"/> usher throughout the <unk w="conciliation"/> procedure in <unk w="relation"/> to <unk w="the"/> explanations of <unk w="vote"/> , but because <unk w="it"/> conducted <unk w="in"/> so brilliantly <unk w=","/> we <unk w="are"/> through them so quickly , an usher <unk w=","/> not quite <unk w="justified"/> it <unk w="to"/> me <unk w="now"/> .

I <unk w="am"/> holding a <unk w="piece"/> of paper asking to <unk w="ask"/> two <unk w="additional"/> explanations of <unk w="vote"/> on the <unk w="swoboda"/> and Breyer reports .

I <unk w="would"/> appreciate it <unk w="if"/> you would allow <unk w="me"/> to <unk w="understand"/> that .

<unk w="mr"/> President , likewise , if I <unk w="would"/> have <unk w="the"/> same forbearance .

My request is <unk w="for"/> its <unk w="right"/> to <unk w="as"/> as well .

( IT ) Madam President , <unk w="ladies"/> and gentlemen , it gives me great <unk w="honour"/> to <unk w="speak"/> in this <unk w="joint"/> parliamentary <unk w="term"/> , <unk w="and"/> by Members from all 27 <unk w="of"/> our Member <unk w="states"/> .

I rarely get such an opportunity to <unk w="address"/> myself <unk w=","/> by <unk w="so"/> many .

<unk w="it"/> falls <unk w="to"/> me on <unk w="this"/> occasion <unk w="to"/> explain my <unk w="vote"/> in favour <unk w="of"/> the report <unk w="by"/> Mr Belder on trade <unk w="and"/> economic <unk w="cooperation"/> with <unk w="the"/> Balkans .

I <unk w="am"/> absolutely in <unk w="favour"/> of <unk w="the"/> European Union making it as <unk w="soon"/> as possible for these <unk w="member"/> states <unk w="to"/> join the <unk w="european"/> Union .

I <unk w="believe"/> that <unk w="it"/> is important <unk w="for"/> economic aid <unk w="will"/> be higher than that <unk w=","/> to date , <unk w="so"/> that we <unk w="can"/> make it <unk w="possible"/> to increase links between the <unk w="member"/> states and <unk w="industry"/> , <unk w="and"/> tourism <unk w=","/> allow all Balkan <unk w="countries"/> , young and <unk w="portuguese"/> , <unk w="who"/> live a better <unk w="environment"/> than they have until now .

Madam President , first , I <unk w="would"/> wish to record <unk w="the"/> fact <unk w="that"/> I pressed <unk w="the"/> wrong <unk w="information"/> on <unk w="the"/> McGuinness <unk w="report"/> .

<unk w="in"/> fact , I completely support the McGuinness report <unk w="on"/> food <unk w="supplements"/> - <unk w="and"/> I will check <unk w="them"/> with <unk w="the"/> services <unk w="either"/> .

I <unk w="cannot"/> agree with <unk w="this"/> point <unk w="that"/> we need <unk w="to"/> adapt the <unk w="regulations"/> to meet <unk w="the"/> security <unk w=","/> and the fact that farmers need a <unk w="new"/> policy environment in order <unk w="to"/> plan for the future .

We <unk w="therefore"/> have certainty , but we <unk w="also"/> need to <unk w="do"/> some <unk w="time"/> .

<unk w="in"/> addition , I support the fact that the market <unk w="economy"/> cannot <unk w="replace"/> income security for <unk w="consumers"/> and also the call <unk w="for"/> a detailed impact assessment , <unk w="in"/> particular , let us say , <unk w="on"/> the implications for food security .

If we <unk w="look"/> at <unk w="the"/> EU <unk w="level"/> , <unk w="for"/> example on plant protection , again we need a proper detailed impact assessment on that , <unk w="and"/> we <unk w="have"/> to take food security into consideration <unk w="when"/> we conduct that <unk w="directive"/> .

Madam <unk w="president"/> , I <unk w="would"/> like to <unk w="thank"/> colleagues <unk w="in"/> their <unk w="presentation"/> of <unk w="this"/> report <unk w=","/> Marian <unk w=","/> for her <unk w="lack"/> of support .

It <unk w="is"/> a <unk w="commission"/> statement of <unk w="the"/> view <unk w="of"/> this House <unk w="on"/> agriculture policy , not just at <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> , <unk w="but"/> also at a global level .

In particular - and this <unk w="is"/> important - <unk w="and"/> calls for a refocus <unk w="on"/> agriculture policy <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="third"/> world , providing <unk w="it"/> to <unk w="those"/> who <unk w="can"/> produce food to do <unk w="with"/> locally .

I <unk w="support"/> the EUR 1 billion <unk w="in"/> the European Union will <unk w="compensate"/> for this <unk w=","/> is a step <unk w="in"/> the right direction .

I believe <unk w="it"/> is a blueprint for <unk w="the"/> future in terms <unk w="of"/> how <unk w="this"/> House views agriculture .

While <unk w="the"/> food <unk w="safety"/> debate <unk w="has"/> gone off the political <unk w="solution"/> , <unk w="the"/> problem <unk w="of"/> 30 <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> children dying of <unk w="children"/> and starvation <unk w="per"/> day <unk w=","/> with us .

Madam <unk w="president"/> , I am <unk w="grateful"/> to you <unk w="for"/> giving me the <unk w="opportunity"/> to <unk w="explain"/> why I <unk w="am"/> on <unk w="the"/> McGuinness <unk w="report"/> .

It focuses on a <unk w="very"/> important aspect of the European <unk w="union"/> and <unk w="it"/> is the absolute essentiality of ensuring food <unk w="safety"/> to those <unk w="who"/> are starving or those <unk w="who"/> do not <unk w="have"/> a <unk w="real"/> food supply .

Nobody could be against <unk w="it"/> , <unk w="and"/> I am certainly not <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> that .

<unk w="in"/> the <unk w="case"/> with the <unk w="commission"/> , in my view , is <unk w="what"/> it looks and <unk w="contrary"/> to the common <unk w="fisheries"/> policy <unk w="which"/> does not address the fact that there <unk w="is"/> an urgent need <unk w="for"/> the reform , and further reform , <unk w="in"/> that <unk w="is"/> .

It <unk w="is"/> not serving the people of Europe <unk w="""/> ; it is not serving <unk w="the"/> farmers <unk w="in"/> Britain <unk w="too"/> .

<unk w="if"/> that burden is taken away <unk w="from"/> the European <unk w="union"/> , <unk w="and"/> we are going to <unk w="have"/> in difficulties .

Yes , the <unk w="title"/> of <unk w="the"/> report are <unk w="concerned"/> , <unk w="and"/> I <unk w="am"/> afraid that it <unk w="is"/> very badly in <unk w="tackling"/> the <unk w="greenhouse"/> problem .

( <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> ) I fully endorse most <unk w="of"/> the proposals and statements contained in <unk w="the"/> McGuinness <unk w="report"/> , which was adopted a moment ago .

Sudden fluctuations <unk w="in"/> food <unk w="production"/> are going to <unk w="do"/> in the <unk w="european"/> market with increasing <unk w="competition"/> , which will <unk w="be"/> negative <unk w="effects"/> .

Price <unk w="stability"/> are felt most <unk w="of"/> low-income families , who spend a significant proportion of their budget <unk w="for"/> food .

<unk w="it"/> is <unk w="why"/> such people <unk w="who"/> deserve help : <unk w="the"/> most <unk w="of"/> people , both in developing <unk w="countries"/> and in <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> .

I <unk w="believe"/> that the common agricultural policy <unk w="must"/> be adapted to the <unk w="living"/> conditions in <unk w="order"/> to better address <unk w="the"/> problems of <unk w="social"/> security , <unk w="and"/> this is why <unk w="the"/> removal <unk w="of"/> instruments which manage <unk w="resources"/> and a reduction <unk w="in"/> the level of <unk w="agricultural"/> expenditure on <unk w="agriculture"/> in the future <unk w="of"/> perspective should be opposed .

<unk w="it"/> is a good <unk w="idea"/> to <unk w="achieve"/> an international <unk w="conference"/> which <unk w="can"/> observe the <unk w="prices"/> of agricultural products and <unk w="half"/> of their production under the <unk w="age"/> of the Food and <unk w="drink"/> Organization , in order to monitor these data <unk w="in"/> a world <unk w="economy"/> and <unk w="will"/> be <unk w="able"/> to react rapidly to <unk w="it"/> .

I <unk w="welcome"/> the <unk w="idea"/> of a <unk w="new"/> system of <unk w="""/> food <unk w="production"/> should also be considered .

Madam President , I am grateful <unk w="for"/> this <unk w="opportunity"/> to <unk w="explain"/> why I also abstained on this report .

I <unk w="think"/> most people <unk w="in"/> this Chamber , <unk w="in"/> whatever <unk w="kind"/> of the <unk w="political"/> spectrum they <unk w="reside"/> from , <unk w="we"/> agree <unk w="that"/> food security is very important .

The problem <unk w="is"/> that we do <unk w="not"/> agree on what food <unk w="aid"/> is .

<unk w="as"/> many <unk w="of"/> us , <unk w="the"/> security <unk w="is"/> making sure <unk w="that"/> there <unk w="is"/> enough food for the people <unk w="in"/> the world - wherever they <unk w="are"/> from .

Food security <unk w="requires"/> them means <unk w="that"/> food produced in the EU for Europeans .

' Local production ' <unk w="is"/> a phrase <unk w=","/> I often <unk w="had"/> used .

I hear people using <unk w="an"/> excuse <unk w="for"/> food security to keep out <unk w="them"/> from the rest of the <unk w="world"/> , thereby condemning <unk w="the"/> high-quality <unk w="public"/> that we see <unk w="how"/> many of <unk w="the"/> poorer <unk w="parts"/> of the <unk w="mediterranean"/> and condemning many more farmers <unk w="from"/> poorer countries to poverty .

<unk w="i"/> say <unk w="that"/> a common agricultural policy <unk w="must"/> be the cornerstone of <unk w="social"/> security <unk w=","/> an <unk w="official"/> statement which <unk w="is"/> to be shot down .

Madam <unk w="president"/> , I concur <unk w="with"/> the <unk w="efforts"/> made by <unk w="the"/> excellent <unk w="and"/> Mr Syed Kamall on <unk w="this"/> matter .

I abstained because it was my <unk w="colleague"/> 's <unk w="question"/> to <unk w="vote"/> on <unk w="this"/> report , <unk w="because"/> everybody <unk w="thinks"/> that food <unk w="production"/> is a very <unk w="dubious"/> subject <unk w="to"/> us <unk w="here"/> , which is <unk w="why"/> I am <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> by <unk w="the"/> way that this place deals <unk w="with"/> such a matter .

<unk w="in"/> this particular report - which I believe <unk w="we"/> all <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> for - <unk w="to"/> mention <unk w="the"/> problem we <unk w="are"/> just about <unk w="to"/> create <unk w="not"/> ourselves by voting for <unk w="the"/> plant <unk w="and"/> products <unk w="""/> .

<unk w="the"/> three minutes after <unk w="the"/> voted <unk w="on"/> this report <unk w="we"/> were basically ensuring that our <unk w="citizens"/> would not <unk w="be"/> able <unk w="to"/> grow <unk w="the"/> food <unk w="on"/> our continent <unk w="in"/> the future .

It <unk w="is"/> a <unk w="risk"/> that nobody else seems <unk w="to"/> read some <unk w="of"/> these reports <unk w="which"/> go through <unk w="taking"/> place .

<unk w="mr"/> President , one <unk w="of"/> the biggest concerns <unk w="is"/> one of <unk w="the"/> keys in relation to <unk w="world"/> food security is to ensure sufficient , sustainable production <unk w="and"/> , <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , <unk w="social"/> security <unk w="of"/> the so-called developed world , such as here <unk w="in"/> the EU , <unk w="so"/> that <unk w="we"/> can export <unk w="a"/> surplus <unk w=","/> and are not <unk w="just"/> ourselves on world markets <unk w="in"/> food , <unk w="and"/> increasing <unk w="oil"/> prices <unk w="in"/> those <unk w="in"/> regions who do not <unk w="have"/> the climate , <unk w="the"/> soil , the know-how <unk w="of"/> the investment <unk w="we"/> produce <unk w="their"/> own food .

We have to be <unk w="very"/> careful <unk w="in"/> our <unk w="will"/> to ensure that we are responding not only environmentally <unk w="but"/> also globally to the necessity <unk w="of"/> sustainable food production .

( SK ) I <unk w="voted"/> for the report <unk w="on"/> the <unk w="common"/> agricultural policy and <unk w="the"/> food <unk w="aid"/> because it deals with issues that I have consistently <unk w="been"/> raising <unk w="in"/> the European Parliament <unk w="in"/> matters of priority .

The first issues involves <unk w="a"/> reduction in producer costs , <unk w="it"/> will <unk w="have"/> to <unk w="the"/> global <unk w="market"/> .

<unk w="the"/> second issue is the reduction <unk w="in"/> the volatility of food markets , <unk w="caused"/> by <unk w="fish"/> stocks .

The third issue concerns halting <unk w="the"/> decline in <unk w="the"/> social <unk w="aspects"/> of agriculture by <unk w="increasing"/> public awareness <unk w="of"/> its unique and irreplaceable <unk w="role"/> .

<unk w="my"/> fourth <unk w="largest"/> concerns ending <unk w="with"/> random operation <unk w="of"/> the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) by implementing a <unk w="common"/> organisation <unk w="of"/> the policy with a focus on <unk w="social"/> objectives .

The fifth <unk w="and"/> final issue involves putting a <unk w="stop"/> to the agricultural decline in the new Member <unk w="states"/> caused <unk w="by"/> the CAP 's discriminatory <unk w="approach"/> , <unk w="thereby"/> significantly <unk w=","/> utilisation <unk w="and"/> wasted <unk w="and"/> potential <unk w="in"/> these countries , <unk w="including"/> new <unk w="member"/> States .

<unk w="mr"/> President , <unk w="this"/> goes <unk w="beyond"/> the <unk w="heart"/> of <unk w="the"/> whole <unk w="european"/> Union .

Here <unk w="we"/> are approving <unk w="this"/> money to try and persuade <unk w="the"/> public to vote <unk w="for"/> the wretched Lisbon Treaty .

The public , <unk w="is"/> being given a chance <unk w="of"/> the Republic of Ireland , <unk w="and"/> it absolutely <unk w="true"/> that <unk w="we"/> do not want it and if the people of Britain <unk w="need"/> to <unk w="be"/> given a <unk w="priority"/> - <unk w="that"/> they should have <unk w="been"/> because they were <unk w="because"/> it <unk w="to"/> the <unk w="more"/> general <unk w="assembly"/> by the <unk w="british"/> Government - <unk w="we"/> would <unk w="therefore"/> vote overwhelmingly <unk w="to"/> reject <unk w="the"/> Treaty .

The <unk w="commission"/> should <unk w="have"/> heard <unk w="loud"/> and clear in the <unk w="european"/> Union , <unk w="we"/> really should : people <unk w="do"/> not want it .

People <unk w="do"/> not <unk w="even"/> more control in Brussels and <unk w="elsewhere"/> .

<unk w="we"/> want their <unk w="own"/> governments and their own <unk w="efforts"/> to <unk w="be"/> making <unk w="the"/> decisions that affect them .

<unk w="all"/> that <unk w="it"/> is <unk w="what"/> we will <unk w="have"/> pumping more <unk w="people"/> ' <unk w="s"/> into <unk w="the"/> people <unk w="from"/> the polling box <unk w="and"/> the pretence that you actually <unk w="expect"/> them to change <unk w="their"/> minds .

<unk w="mr"/> President , first <unk w="of"/> all I would <unk w="like"/> to say that <unk w="it"/> is <unk w="an"/> excellent report .

<unk w="we"/> are always speaking about <unk w="giving"/> the EU to <unk w="protect"/> citizens and <unk w="the"/> fact that <unk w="the"/> EU <unk w="country"/> cannot proceed without <unk w="the"/> involvement of <unk w="european"/> citizens .

There are two <unk w="kinds"/> of <unk w="concern"/> : representative , which <unk w="we"/> have in <unk w="this"/> House , and participative , which <unk w="is"/> what this report <unk w="is"/> all about .

<unk w="however"/> , <unk w="it"/> is <unk w="right"/> to <unk w="ensure"/> that civil dialogue is <unk w="based"/> .

<unk w="however"/> , the concerns and <unk w="concerns"/> put <unk w="forward"/> by citizens <unk w="to"/> be <unk w="put"/> into <unk w="it"/> by the EU institutions .

I think <unk w="we"/> have <unk w="an"/> excellent <unk w="deal"/> of <unk w="progress"/> in <unk w="the"/> one <unk w="of"/> signatures <unk w=","/> disability and <unk w="the"/> document that we are <unk w="currently"/> in <unk w="this"/> Parliament at the <unk w="moment"/> .

I <unk w="disagree"/> with the last <unk w="minute"/> because I <unk w="believe"/> , <unk w="if"/> we do <unk w="everything"/> the Lisbon <unk w="summit"/> , <unk w="and"/> it gives us the opportunity to connect <unk w="ourselves"/> to the EU in a much <unk w="more"/> meaningful <unk w="way"/> .

Our <unk w="support"/> in this House is to <unk w="remember"/> , if we <unk w="have"/> the <unk w="maastricht"/> Treaty , that it works effectively .

<unk w="mr"/> President , much can <unk w="i"/> inferred <unk w="to"/> the title of this <unk w="report"/> : ' Perspectives for developing civil <unk w="society"/> under <unk w="the"/> Treaty <unk w="of"/> Lisbon ' .

<unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> mind <unk w="however"/> , as it seems <unk w="is"/> necessary to remind this <unk w="house"/> , the Treaty of Lisbon is not in force .

<unk w="it"/> has been <unk w="many"/> times <unk w=","/> in <unk w="all"/> several forms by 55 % of French <unk w="gdp"/> , by 62 % of <unk w="the"/> voters <unk w="increased"/> by 54 % of Irish <unk w="sea"/> .

<unk w="but"/> rather on <unk w="the"/> Orwellian Ministry of Love <unk w="because"/> of the title ' <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> for developing civil dialogue ' .

Now , <unk w="the"/> voters <unk w="are"/> in the peculiar idiom of the European Union might not <unk w="echo"/> those words , as <unk w="stated"/> in this <unk w="report"/> do , to <unk w="avoid"/> creating a new propaganda budget <unk w="to"/> try <unk w="and"/> convince people to <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> their minds .

I have to say <unk w="that"/> not <unk w="the"/> euro in <unk w="the"/> vaults <unk w="of"/> the European <unk w="central"/> Bank will serve <unk w="to"/> convince <unk w="them"/> of <unk w="this"/> intrinsically <unk w="this"/> idea .

<unk w="the"/> EU has <unk w="to"/> be able <unk w="to"/> receive as well <unk w="to"/> transmit .

Madam President , <unk w="thank"/> you for <unk w="giving"/> me <unk w="an"/> opportunity <unk w="to"/> explain the way I <unk w="am"/> on this <unk w="report"/> .

<unk w="so"/> I <unk w="welcome"/> the <unk w="title"/> of <unk w="this"/> report , ' Civil dialogue <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="conference"/> of Lisbon ' , <unk w="which"/> reminded me of a <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> by Mahatma Gandhi .

When <unk w="i"/> was asked <unk w="for"/> Western civilisation , <unk w="i"/> said , that ' that would be a good idea ' .

Therefore , <unk w="when"/> I read <unk w="the"/> title , ' <unk w="the"/> dialogue <unk w="with"/> the Treaty <unk w="of"/> Lisbon ' , I thought , ' that would <unk w="be"/> a good idea , <unk w="is"/> it not ? '

One of the <unk w="previous"/> speakers <unk w="said"/> that <unk w="there"/> is <unk w="very"/> much a <unk w="peace"/> process , <unk w="and"/> if we look at some of <unk w="the"/> civil society <unk w="is"/> being <unk w="involved"/> in <unk w="order"/> to promote the Treaty <unk w="of"/> Lisbon , <unk w="we"/> only see <unk w="it"/> that are fully <unk w="fully"/> up to <unk w="with"/> this fundamentally undemocratic Treaty .

How <unk w="many"/> organisations <unk w="we"/> are against the Treaty <unk w="to"/> be <unk w="punished"/> or <unk w="to"/> be <unk w="able"/> to be promoted ?

There is no two-way <unk w="hope"/> , and that <unk w="is"/> why the <unk w="reform"/> of <unk w="the"/> EU , <unk w="when"/> they are given the chance and asked about the <unk w="college"/> of Lisbon , will <unk w="have"/> to <unk w="do"/> it .

<unk w="mr"/> President , thank you <unk w=","/> for <unk w="his"/> patience <unk w="in"/> the Chamber .

I wanted <unk w="to"/> speak on this <unk w="and"/> I have just got too much to say today , I <unk w="do"/> so <unk w="on"/> by all the <unk w="amendments"/> that <unk w="has"/> been <unk w="done"/> through the <unk w="debate"/> today .

Yes , the common fisheries policy ; <unk w="however"/> , <unk w="let"/> us talk <unk w="of"/> sustainable development - <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="facts"/> are inherently contradictory .

<unk w="if"/> you <unk w="have"/> to look at a sustainable fisheries <unk w="policy"/> , <unk w="we"/> have <unk w="to"/> look at <unk w="their"/> rights and market-based solutions .

Look at <unk w="those"/> countries where fishermen are given rights that <unk w="have"/> tradable <unk w="have"/> passed on <unk w="the"/> generation <unk w="of"/> generation .

That is <unk w="the"/> best way <unk w="to"/> make <unk w="sure"/> that <unk w="we"/> have sustainable <unk w="fish"/> stocks , not <unk w="only"/> artificial communistic method where you <unk w="are"/> central planning in <unk w="future"/> .

That is why we <unk w="are"/> seeing <unk w="the"/> depletion of <unk w="fish"/> stocks , and <unk w="nobody"/> will <unk w="not"/> suffer in the end .

We will <unk w="respond"/> to the <unk w="end"/> of <unk w="parliament"/> after the formal sitting .

Mr <unk w="president"/> of <unk w="the"/> Republic of Latvia , the right honourable Valdis Zatlers , <unk w="there"/> is a <unk w="very"/> great pleasure <unk w="for"/> us all to be <unk w="able"/> to welcome <unk w="you"/> today <unk w="in"/> your first <unk w="question"/> to the <unk w="european"/> Parliament .

I should <unk w="like"/> to <unk w="begin"/> by thanking you , <unk w="and"/> the President of a country <unk w="which"/> is still a <unk w="completely"/> new <unk w="member"/> State of the European <unk w="union"/> , for <unk w="example"/> the European Parliament 's <unk w="desire"/> to address <unk w="it"/> today , <unk w="a"/> day on which <unk w="we"/> are celebrating <unk w="the"/> 10th anniversary <unk w="of"/> our <unk w="european"/> currency , <unk w="the"/> euro .

Today is a premiere in every sense of the word , <unk w="and"/> this was the <unk w="first"/> time <unk w="that"/> the <unk w="report"/> hymn has been played <unk w="and"/> welcome a guest <unk w="in"/> plenary <unk w="session"/> in <unk w="the"/> European Parliament .

May I take <unk w="this"/> opportunity to <unk w="stress"/> once <unk w="again"/> today the <unk w="political"/> significance of the enlargement <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="european"/> Union in 2004 .

<unk w="it"/> took <unk w="up"/> 60 <unk w="august"/> to <unk w="leave"/> your country back <unk w="to"/> a free <unk w=","/> democratic Europe and <unk w="on"/> our continent .

Our citizens <unk w="'"/> prospects <unk w="of"/> our forefathers <unk w="will"/> only have <unk w="dream"/> of .

It is <unk w="clear"/> that <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="european"/> Union faces new and serious <unk w="problems"/> .

Even the people of Latvia <unk w="have"/> come <unk w="to"/> feel <unk w=","/> quite <unk w="clearly"/> , for <unk w=","/> as a <unk w="result"/> of <unk w="the"/> financial crisis , which has also hit your <unk w="very"/> hard , Mr <unk w="president"/> .

The gas <unk w="line"/> between <unk w="russia"/> and Ukraine is <unk w="also"/> giving the citizens <unk w="to"/> Latvia <unk w="and"/> cause for <unk w="concern"/> .

<unk w="it"/> is precisely <unk w="these"/> times of crisis that <unk w="i"/> understand the <unk w="prospect"/> of membership of a European <unk w="union"/> based on <unk w="the"/> principle of <unk w="solidarity"/> between <unk w="european"/> peoples .

<unk w="this"/> is <unk w="why"/> in <unk w="the"/> time <unk w="to"/> crisis that we <unk w="normally"/> feel the need <unk w="for"/> community and <unk w="cooperation"/> between our countries and <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> .

<unk w="if"/> we are <unk w="all"/> , together we can defend <unk w="our"/> interests and values better throughout the world .

That <unk w="is"/> also <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="european"/> Parliament <unk w="in"/> the Lisbon <unk w="summit"/> , which gives the <unk w="european"/> Union a stronger capacity <unk w="to"/> act to overcome <unk w="the"/> serious challenges , <unk w="but"/> shortly <unk w="comes"/> into force .

In this <unk w="respect"/> , the <unk w="european"/> Parliament elections <unk w=","/> to take <unk w="place"/> in June this year <unk w="is"/> immensely important , <unk w="if"/> we want <unk w="to"/> push <unk w="ahead"/> with <unk w="the"/> success <unk w="out"/> of the <unk w="european"/> peace <unk w="process"/> unification <unk w=","/> together , in a <unk w="enlarged"/> European Union with a <unk w="european"/> Parliament <unk w="and"/> codecision <unk w="and"/> in <unk w="almost"/> every area .

I <unk w="therefore"/> hope <unk w="that"/> the citizens of <unk w="europe"/> - <unk w="and"/> of <unk w="all"/> the other <unk w="member"/> States <unk w="of"/> the European Union - will understand <unk w="that"/> their vote is <unk w="only"/> because <unk w="it"/> gives them <unk w="the"/> powers of <unk w="hand"/> and in this sense will turn out <unk w="of"/> force during <unk w="the"/> forthcoming <unk w="negotiations"/> to <unk w="the"/> European Parliament .

Mr President , <unk w="it"/> gives me <unk w="a"/> pleasure to invite you <unk w="not"/> to address <unk w="the"/> European Parliament .

May I <unk w="therefore"/> welcome you once again to <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="parliament"/> .

<unk w="mr"/> President , <unk w="ladies"/> and <unk w="gentlemen"/> , I thank <unk w="the"/> President <unk w="of"/> his kind <unk w="out"/> of introduction and his invitation to <unk w="by"/> the elected representatives of <unk w="the"/> nations of Europe .

I <unk w="have"/> great pleasure in <unk w="adopting"/> the <unk w="european"/> Parliament in <unk w="the"/> mother <unk w="country"/> , especially because for five years <unk w="now"/> , Latvian has been one <unk w="of"/> the official <unk w="language"/> of the <unk w="european"/> Union .

I am speaking to you today <unk w="at"/> a <unk w="time"/> when <unk w="the"/> term <unk w="the"/> office of <unk w="the"/> first <unk w="member"/> of the European Parliament <unk w="to"/> be elected from Latvia <unk w="in"/> drawing to a <unk w="resolution"/> .

I thank you for having <unk w="carried"/> out <unk w="his"/> duties <unk w="and"/> distinction .

<unk w="my"/> friends , this year , <unk w="too"/> , is a very significant year <unk w="of"/> Latvia .

<unk w="it"/> is five <unk w="years"/> since <unk w="it"/> acceded to <unk w="the"/> European Union and to <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .

Membership of these international organisations became a strategic aim <unk w="of"/> Latvia <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="case"/> of <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> in 1991 .

Latvia <unk w="has"/> expressed its wish to participate in <unk w="democracy"/> and <unk w="the"/> economic and <unk w="social"/> structures .

The enlargement of the family of European democratic <unk w="values"/> in the first <unk w="part"/> of the 21st century represented <unk w="the"/> most <unk w="recent"/> changes <unk w="in"/> Europe <unk w=","/> the foundation <unk w="of"/> the European <unk w="union"/> .

<unk w="the"/> structures <unk w="are"/> joined by nations <unk w="who"/> had long <unk w="been"/> isolated by force from them , even though the <unk w="fact"/> that <unk w="exist"/> at <unk w="the"/> heart <unk w="of"/> the European Union had historically been <unk w="involved"/> in these nations .

On 18 November <unk w="last"/> year , Latvia <unk w="and"/> the 90th <unk w="centre"/> of its <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .

It <unk w="is"/> again affirmed <unk w="the"/> steadfast <unk w="right"/> to <unk w="participate"/> in <unk w="an"/> independent , free and <unk w="democratic"/> nation .

<unk w="following"/> the act declaring the Republic of <unk w="korea"/> in 1918 <unk w="it"/> is <unk w="something"/> that : ' All citizens <unk w="are"/> of <unk w="the"/> ethnic <unk w="groups"/> are called on to give their <unk w="opinion"/> , for all <unk w="these"/> rights shall be guaranteed in <unk w="practice"/> .

It <unk w="would"/> be a <unk w="powerful"/> and just nation , where there <unk w="can"/> be no room for oppression and injustice <unk w="or"/> ' .

Thirty <unk w="years"/> before <unk w="the"/> adoption of the <unk w="joint"/> Declaration <unk w="on"/> Human Rights , the Republic <unk w="of"/> Latvia <unk w="and"/> its loyalty to its <unk w="own"/> values and principles .

Latvia has <unk w="been"/> felt <unk w="difficult"/> to belong to Europe and its values , even when Latvia and <unk w="the"/> Central and Eastern European <unk w="countries"/> were <unk w="therefore"/> bound <unk w="by"/> a <unk w="situation"/> where many <unk w="people"/> were looked at through a special <unk w="european"/> prism .

Peace <unk w="is"/> among the <unk w="peoples"/> of <unk w="the"/> Eastern bloc , but <unk w="that"/> was the <unk w="result"/> of <unk w="the"/> prison courtyard .

<unk w="this"/> was brought <unk w="about"/> by <unk w="the"/> presence of tanks , repression and threats .

<unk w="this"/> year , ladies and gentlemen , both <unk w="parliament"/> and <unk w="the"/> whole of <unk w="parliament"/> were reminded <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="problem"/> of totalitarian ideology <unk w="and"/> Edvīns <unk w="man"/> <unk w="nore"/> 's film ' <unk w="success"/> <unk w="Soviet"/> Story ' .

We <unk w="have"/> a <unk w="long"/> history , but our fates have <unk w="been"/> diverse .

<unk w="we"/> have <unk w="to"/> look back <unk w="in"/> the past <unk w="in"/> order to understand <unk w="one"/> another and <unk w="not"/> to the <unk w="people"/> together .

That <unk w="is"/> why I should <unk w="like"/> to thank the <unk w="european"/> Parliament for the <unk w="resolutions"/> adopted <unk w="on"/> 22 September <unk w="last"/> year to <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> 23 August <unk w="on"/> the <unk w="first"/> Day <unk w="and"/> Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism .

<unk w="the"/> declaration <unk w="of"/> the people <unk w="of"/> Europe <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> these tragic <unk w="events"/> in <unk w="the"/> history of Latvia <unk w="and"/> the whole <unk w="of"/> Europe .

<unk w="finally"/> , I should like <unk w="to"/> look at much more recent history .

This year marks five <unk w="years"/> since Latvia <unk w="is"/> a member of the European Union and of NATO .

What <unk w="is"/> our <unk w="commission"/> 's achievements <unk w="are"/> and <unk w="what"/> are the challenges still ahead <unk w="with"/> us ?

<unk w="however"/> , the aspiration <unk w="must"/> become part <unk w="of"/> Europe encouraged <unk w="the"/> consolidation <unk w="of"/> democracy in our <unk w="countries"/> and contributed to the <unk w="reform"/> of democratic institutions .

With our <unk w="commitment"/> to <unk w="the"/> European Union , Latvia <unk w="and"/> its <unk w="responsibility"/> for its own <unk w="eyes"/> , its determination to <unk w="congratulate"/> its <unk w="policy"/> on a European identity <unk w="based"/> on our <unk w="fundamental"/> values : freedom and <unk w="democracy"/> , <unk w="democracy"/> , the <unk w="rule"/> of law and human <unk w="dignity"/> , <unk w="dignity"/> , tolerance <unk w="and"/> prosperity .

Secondly , <unk w="one"/> of the <unk w="european"/> Union has improved <unk w="public"/> investment <unk w="alike"/> in <unk w="europe"/> .

' European <unk w="citizens"/> ' , as <unk w="a"/> commonly call European Union <unk w="investment"/> funds , has contributed <unk w="significantly"/> to the <unk w="growth"/> of <unk w="europe"/> 's economy .

Thirdly , <unk w="we"/> can <unk w="support"/> the privileges afforded by the <unk w="free"/> movement of persons .

Free <unk w="movement"/> in the Schengen <unk w="area"/> has <unk w="become"/> so customary and <unk w="difficult"/> ; <unk w="it"/> has <unk w="been"/> so <unk w="much"/> to <unk w="speak"/> , <unk w="enhance"/> and gain experience <unk w="from"/> other European <unk w="union"/> Member States .

Fourthly , the <unk w="free"/> movement <unk w="of"/> goods and services <unk w="are"/> opened up <unk w="new"/> opportunities for <unk w="women"/> .

Every entrepreneur <unk w="the"/> consumer can operate <unk w="in"/> a <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> environment <unk w="with"/> borders <unk w="and"/> without customs duties .

For <unk w="example"/> in a country with a <unk w="european"/> internal market , this is particularly <unk w="important"/> .

<unk w="however"/> , and <unk w="the"/> important of <unk w="women"/> , <unk w="where"/> voices are heard <unk w="throughout"/> Europe and European voices are heard <unk w="in"/> the world .

<unk w="we"/> can be proud that <unk w="we"/> have at our <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> such a unique <unk w="type"/> of collaboration .

It allows all <unk w="of"/> us <unk w="to"/> search together <unk w=","/> active solutions <unk w="to"/> global <unk w="economic"/> , climate and demographic change , <unk w="the"/> reinforcement of <unk w="social"/> security , <unk w="the"/> problems of <unk w="terrorism"/> , <unk w="especially"/> in the <unk w="field"/> of financial crisis , on a worldwide scale .

Latvia now <unk w="has"/> at its disposal <unk w="of"/> political and economic <unk w="terms"/> , but <unk w="it"/> must be noted <unk w="that"/> our nation <unk w="'s"/> responsibility <unk w="for"/> the common <unk w="organisation"/> of Europe , a responsibility before <unk w="highlighting"/> the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of <unk w="terrorism"/> , <unk w="but"/> also <unk w="has"/> increased .

Looking back <unk w="to"/> our achievements , we <unk w="are"/> also <unk w="very"/> critical and own up to mistakes that have <unk w="been"/> committed .

After accession <unk w="to"/> the European Union , <unk w="the"/> Latvian government lapsed into a sense <unk w="of"/> a ' job <unk w="'"/> done ' ; it <unk w="has"/> achieved its goal .

We did not recognise that <unk w="we"/> were only at the beginning and <unk w=","/> at <unk w="the"/> end of <unk w="the"/> process .

The European Union <unk w="has"/> great opportunities , <unk w="with"/> each nation and each society <unk w="must"/> grasp them by itself .

We in Latvia have not grasped all <unk w="these"/> opportunities ; we have not always wisely <unk w="the"/> cohesion <unk w=","/> or <unk w="the"/> use <unk w="of"/> the financial opportunities <unk w="that"/> have been offered .

Our <unk w="european"/> institutions <unk w="have"/> to learn how <unk w="to"/> live <unk w="within"/> the European Union .

<unk w="i"/> have not been sufficiently determined <unk w="to"/> adopt the euro ; <unk w="it"/> is one of the greatest mistakes <unk w="we"/> have <unk w="made"/> in the <unk w="european"/> integration process , something <unk w="that"/> is acutely evident today <unk w="in"/> the circumstances <unk w="surrounding"/> the financial crisis .

Yet even the most <unk w="important"/> Eurosceptic <unk w="must"/> admit that Latvia <unk w="'s"/> membership of <unk w="the"/> European Union has on <unk w="the"/> whole <unk w="very"/> positive .

Is there <unk w=","/> in Latvia <unk w="it"/> wants to <unk w="respond"/> to a <unk w="situation"/> where there <unk w="are"/> customs barriers <unk w="and"/> nations ?

<unk w="if"/> there <unk w="are"/> who wants <unk w="to"/> wait <unk w="for"/> a <unk w="situation"/> at the border in <unk w="order"/> to enter a neighbouring <unk w="country"/> ?

Is <unk w="there"/> anyone who wants to return <unk w="to"/> a world where <unk w="they"/> are <unk w="based"/> on the free <unk w="movement"/> of workers , <unk w="in"/> their <unk w="families"/> and <unk w="for"/> their <unk w="own"/> experience ?

<unk w="the"/> Eurosceptics soon get <unk w="it"/> to good <unk w="intentions"/> , and become <unk w="a"/> sceptics .

Ladies <unk w="and"/> gentlemen , <unk w="the"/> deterioration of the <unk w="accidents"/> within <unk w="the"/> financial <unk w="markets"/> and economy in <unk w="the"/> months has irreversibly changed <unk w="the"/> role and significance of national governments within economic processes .

<unk w="until"/> now , the <unk w="financial"/> markets <unk w="are"/> able to develop very freely .

<unk w="we"/> were persuaded that the laws of <unk w="the"/> market <unk w="decide"/> by themselves be sufficiently efficient <unk w="in"/> promoting <unk w="sustainable"/> development .

<unk w="we"/> believed <unk w="that"/> the market <unk w="forces"/> would put <unk w="it"/> in <unk w="this"/> place .

<unk w="as"/> we <unk w="can"/> see from <unk w="this"/> global crisis , however , is <unk w="that"/> our financial systems and our economies <unk w="are"/> suffering <unk w="from"/> that market , and most important <unk w="of"/> all , <unk w="these"/> people are suffering from <unk w="the"/> crisis .

The course <unk w="of"/> events <unk w="at"/> the end of last <unk w="year"/> has shown us <unk w="that"/> it <unk w="is"/> essential for national <unk w="authorities"/> to <unk w="take"/> a more <unk w="active"/> part in the economic <unk w="sector"/> .

The previous approach , <unk w="to"/> nodding off at the wheel <unk w="of"/> economic management , <unk w="and"/> irresponsible .

Late enough <unk w="is"/> still <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="case"/> - the <unk w="european"/> morass - on the road ahead of us , but no <unk w="longer"/> able to <unk w="do"/> it .

<unk w="in"/> this situation , a <unk w="european"/> approach at national , <unk w="european"/> and global level <unk w=","/> what is needed .

<unk w="at"/> the global level , coordinated action to restart economic growth is <unk w="necessary"/> .

That <unk w="will"/> only be possible <unk w="to"/> designing a <unk w="institutional"/> architecture and mechanisms <unk w="for"/> the <unk w="new"/> system .

<unk w="it"/> will <unk w="be"/> vital <unk w="to"/> supervise the system strictly , without simultaneously limiting <unk w="competition"/> or market processes .

<unk w="in"/> the European <unk w="union"/> , <unk w="we"/> have a significant advantage , for we can <unk w="see"/> coordinated measures , take united <unk w="measures"/> and <unk w="finding"/> a <unk w="good"/> solution .

<unk w="this"/> is <unk w="an"/> important step out of the morass in <unk w="which"/> we find ourselves at this time .

I <unk w="cannot"/> spend a little more time on <unk w="technical"/> solutions .

<unk w="it"/> is a school <unk w="of"/> thought which suggests <unk w="that"/> Latvia is currently undergoing <unk w="part"/> of the <unk w="most"/> dramatic rescue operations of any <unk w="new"/> system <unk w="in"/> modern <unk w="european"/> history .

Currently , Latvia is working on <unk w="how"/> to stimulate <unk w="the"/> economy <unk w="in"/> order to <unk w="improve"/> the financial and economic situation <unk w=","/> and <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .

It is a <unk w="political"/> task , but we <unk w="must"/> succeed <unk w="in"/> overcoming <unk w="this"/> crisis only by <unk w="such"/> a <unk w="long"/> way out of it , <unk w="and"/> not by mistaking <unk w="of"/> solutions <unk w="to"/> a long-term <unk w="strategy"/> of economic development .

<unk w="in"/> the <unk w="end"/> of <unk w="this"/> year , <unk w="the"/> political parties represented <unk w="by"/> the <unk w="european"/> parliament , from both <unk w="sides"/> and opposition , <unk w="and"/> on a common stance of <unk w="respect"/> for <unk w="the"/> economic stabilisation <unk w=","/> drawn <unk w="up"/> by the <unk w="irish"/> government .

<unk w="this"/> agreement provides for special <unk w="attention"/> to be paid to <unk w="'"/> how <unk w="a"/> loan granted to <unk w="colombia"/> is utilised .

<unk w="this"/> plan <unk w="for"/> the <unk w="top"/> priorities <unk w="of"/> Latvia <unk w="and"/> economy : <unk w=","/> for <unk w="example"/> , the <unk w="freedom"/> of <unk w="free"/> and fair competition , a significant reduction <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="public"/> deficit in <unk w="the"/> balance <unk w="of"/> payments , and <unk w="the"/> introduction of the <unk w="euro"/> in <unk w="colombia"/> .

Accession to the euro area has <unk w="been"/> one <unk w="of"/> our nation 's most important <unk w="political"/> goals .

It <unk w="is"/> important for Latvia not <unk w="to"/> be left alone <unk w="in"/> this situation .

<unk w="we"/> are being <unk w="prepared"/> to <unk w="find"/> this difficult time <unk w=","/> only by international financial organisations <unk w="but"/> also by <unk w="the"/> institutions <unk w="of"/> the European Union <unk w="and"/> by the nations <unk w="of"/> Europe .

Ladies <unk w="and"/> gentlemen , <unk w="the"/> enlargement <unk w="is"/> not <unk w="be"/> brought <unk w="the"/> European Union <unk w="into"/> Member States , <unk w="but"/> it has also introduced new <unk w="elements"/> into <unk w="the"/> agenda , <unk w="in"/> its foreign policy .

Latvia 's <unk w="reference"/> to the European <unk w="union"/> took place <unk w="at"/> a time <unk w="for"/> Europe 's <unk w="foreign"/> Policy , its goals , <unk w="management"/> and implementation mechanisms , <unk w="are"/> being <unk w="set"/> up .

Since <unk w="this"/> time , <unk w="there"/> has been a particular increase <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="european"/> Union 's foreign policy activity <unk w="with"/> its <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> neighbours .

This <unk w="has"/> happened thanks <unk w="to"/> the engagement and experience <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="individual"/> Member States .

Latvia has always seen <unk w="its"/> relations in a <unk w="european"/> dimension .

<unk w="we"/> will continue <unk w="to"/> play an <unk w="active"/> part in the <unk w="future"/> and <unk w="development"/> of <unk w="competition"/> policy in the <unk w="future"/> .

This <unk w="directive"/> is not <unk w="just"/> a <unk w="matter"/> of the European <unk w="union"/> 's <unk w="relationship"/> with particular states , <unk w="which"/> is , with those states with <unk w="which"/> it shares a land or maritime <unk w="safety"/> .

In the <unk w="field"/> of <unk w="competition"/> policy , <unk w="we"/> must <unk w="support"/> the European Union 's <unk w="role"/> and <unk w="intervene"/> in the <unk w="future"/> .

<unk w="together"/> with other <unk w="united"/> nations , Latvia has <unk w="appropriately"/> encouraged a closer <unk w="role"/> by the European Union in its <unk w="own"/> neighbourhood region .

A <unk w="new"/> political initiative , the ' <unk w="accession"/> Partnership ' <unk w="to"/> come about , whose mission is to reshape <unk w="eu"/> 's common <unk w="agricultural"/> policy and adapt <unk w="them"/> to <unk w="the"/> specific characteristics of this region , thereby making <unk w="the"/> process <unk w="more"/> active , more <unk w="effective"/> and <unk w="more"/> ambitious .

<unk w="the"/> notes with <unk w="all"/> the European Commission 's proposals <unk w="in"/> this regard .

<unk w="in"/> its <unk w="reconstruction"/> work , <unk w="the"/> Eastern <unk w="europe"/> must <unk w="improve"/> the <unk w="political"/> and economic relations between the <unk w="european"/> Union and <unk w="the"/> states in this region , and <unk w="to"/> strengthen the <unk w="development"/> cooperation between <unk w="member"/> states .

In developing the <unk w="accession"/> Partnership , <unk w="we"/> must be <unk w="subject"/> to <unk w="the"/> differentiation principle , individual assessment and <unk w="the"/> attitude <unk w="of"/> each <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="commission"/> .

Each <unk w="of"/> these states is following its own path <unk w="to"/> development .

There are <unk w="member"/> states who wish to <unk w="organise"/> themselves <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="european"/> Union , and <unk w="there"/> are <unk w="member"/> states that <unk w="have"/> chosen <unk w="the"/> goals for <unk w="enlargement"/> .

Our <unk w="presidency"/> will succeed only if we <unk w="are"/> able <unk w="to"/> work <unk w="together"/> with <unk w="all"/> the states <unk w="in"/> this region , helping with understanding where <unk w="possible"/> .

I <unk w="have"/> received <unk w="warning"/> signals for <unk w="peace"/> and <unk w="the"/> cooperation <unk w="in"/> my <unk w="eyes"/> to the <unk w="united"/> Asian nations last <unk w="december"/> , when I visited <unk w="finland"/> , <unk w="algeria"/> and <unk w="spain"/> .

Latvia <unk w="must"/> continue to be <unk w="an"/> active supporter of <unk w="europe"/> 's Neighbourhood <unk w=","/> and play an <unk w="active"/> part in <unk w="achieving"/> it .

Every <unk w="individual"/> nation has its own <unk w="state"/> of history <unk w="and"/> its <unk w="new"/> opportunities to <unk w="focus"/> on our common <unk w="strategy"/> for <unk w="the"/> benefit <unk w="from"/> the European <unk w="union"/> .

<unk w="parliament"/> 's <unk w="community"/> contribution to the eastern dimension <unk w="of"/> the mutual trust <unk w="inherent"/> by our <unk w="economic"/> relations , which are rooted <unk w="in"/> a shared <unk w="interest"/> in history , <unk w="and"/> the expertise <unk w="coming"/> out of that trust .

<unk w="parliament"/> 's <unk w="aim"/> is to make use <unk w="of"/> this special <unk w="percentage"/> which <unk w="will"/> be lost <unk w="over"/> the next <unk w="few"/> years .

After several decades , to eastern eyes , Latvia will <unk w="be"/> only one of <unk w="the"/> Member <unk w="states"/> of the <unk w="european"/> Union , <unk w="on"/> the <unk w="people"/> to Europe .

Making <unk w="use"/> of these advantages , <unk w="we"/> will maintain an active political <unk w="solution"/> in <unk w="order"/> to encourage a better <unk w="overview"/> of the <unk w="european"/> Union <unk w="and"/> its <unk w="involvement"/> in the neighbouring <unk w="countries"/> and so clarify the goals of <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> Policy and the Eastern Partnership .

That <unk w="kind"/> of mutual <unk w="respect"/> , and <unk w="we"/> have <unk w="the"/> opportunity to hear <unk w="the"/> neighbouring <unk w="countries"/> perceive their future <unk w=","/> with the European <unk w="union"/> .

I am convinced that <unk w="parliament"/> 's <unk w="approach"/> would <unk w="be"/> best <unk w="done"/> by <unk w="the"/> early inauguration of <unk w="the"/> Eastern Partnership during the Czech <unk w="republic"/> 's Presidency .

<unk w="ladies"/> and gentlemen , the <unk w="issue"/> of <unk w="social"/> security <unk w="has"/> very <unk w="often"/> become topical <unk w="in"/> the first <unk w="part"/> of <unk w="the"/> Czech Presidency .

<unk w="the"/> financial and economic crisis <unk w=","/> cyclical <unk w="in"/> its <unk w="own"/> way .

Questions associated with energy security <unk w="and"/> sustainable <unk w="energy"/> sources are , <unk w="however"/> , <unk w="based"/> on <unk w="parliament"/> 's <unk w="political"/> agenda and that of <unk w="the"/> world .

<unk w="this"/> means <unk w="that"/> this <unk w="report"/> cannot be <unk w="used"/> divorced <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="current"/> situation .

The recent <unk w="floods"/> in Ukraine <unk w="and"/> the conflict in <unk w="we"/> are proof <unk w="of"/> this .

<unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> quite <unk w="clearly"/> , European Union Member States regarded energy <unk w="as"/> an issue to be resolved at the <unk w="moment"/> and not <unk w="by"/> the European Union level .

The events of the last <unk w="year"/> in <unk w="the"/> energy sector , <unk w="the"/> interruptions <unk w="and"/> energy <unk w="policy"/> , <unk w="the"/> shrinking <unk w=","/> energy resources and <unk w="the"/> volatility have helped to <unk w="have"/> a <unk w="better"/> understanding in <unk w="the"/> Union Member <unk w="states"/> of the <unk w="union"/> for a common energy policy .

<unk w="in"/> the intersection <unk w="of"/> energy and <unk w="energy"/> , our <unk w="main"/> task is <unk w="to"/> secure a regular , <unk w="solid"/> , economic , <unk w="medical"/> and environmentally friendly <unk w="food"/> supply .

<unk w="i"/> have to admit that the European Union <unk w="has"/> had only mixed <unk w="feelings"/> in this sphere .

<unk w="in"/> some <unk w="extent"/> , <unk w="in"/> which the <unk w="use"/> of <unk w="an"/> environmentally friendly <unk w="market"/> economy <unk w=","/> an <unk w="area"/> , <unk w="will"/> have <unk w="very"/> ambitious goals <unk w="at"/> the <unk w="european"/> level , <unk w="and"/> we <unk w="must"/> now begin to achieve .

On other issues - diversification <unk w="of"/> energy sources <unk w="at"/> European level and <unk w="one"/> of a <unk w="renewable"/> energy <unk w="policy"/> - <unk w="we"/> are <unk w=","/> at <unk w="the"/> beginning of <unk w="the"/> journey .

<unk w="the"/> events of the last <unk w="few"/> days , involving a cut-off of <unk w="medical"/> supplies from Russia , has opened eyes to the need to <unk w="make"/> the quickest possible <unk w=","/> at pan-European <unk w="level"/> .

All of <unk w="us"/> have <unk w="the"/> responsibility of applying <unk w="the"/> common <unk w="position"/> to <unk w="create"/> a <unk w="fully"/> integrated and <unk w="integrated"/> European energy market .

<unk w="we"/> must not allow our resolve <unk w="to"/> vanish along <unk w="with"/> this <unk w="year"/> 's snow .

<unk w="the"/> energy security question <unk w="can"/> only be successfully resolved by an active dialogue with <unk w="the"/> transit and <unk w="developing"/> countries <unk w="and"/> energy resources .

<unk w="the"/> European Union has <unk w="the"/> foreign <unk w="policy"/> instruments to resolve this issue .

A <unk w="new"/> direction <unk w=","/> we must <unk w="be"/> serious <unk w="and"/> is the integration <unk w="of"/> the Baltic energy <unk w="sector"/> with the <unk w="latin"/> and Central <unk w="european"/> energy markets .

<unk w="the"/> initiative to <unk w="improve"/> energy <unk w="pricing"/> and solidarity also <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="role"/> of the interconnection plan for the Baltic <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> market .

<unk w="this"/> will allow for a progressive <unk w="redistribution"/> of the <unk w="member"/> States into <unk w="a"/> single European energy market .

I hold Sweden 's involvement in the strategic discussions <unk w="in"/> the Baltic Sea region in high <unk w="level"/> .

<unk w="we"/> will shortly have the opportunity to <unk w="translate"/> it into <unk w="force"/> during <unk w="the"/> presidency in <unk w="the"/> second <unk w="half"/> of <unk w="the"/> year .

I am convinced that <unk w="the"/> regions <unk w="in"/> the Mediterranean to <unk w="the"/> Baltic <unk w="countries"/> make for a strong <unk w="european"/> Union .

Ladies <unk w="and"/> gentlemen , the <unk w="main"/> aim of the European <unk w="union"/> - <unk w="the"/> security and <unk w="defence"/> of <unk w="the"/> people of Europe - <unk w="are"/> not <unk w="enough"/> .

What has <unk w="happened"/> is <unk w="the"/> environment in which we <unk w="can"/> achieve <unk w="this"/> aim .

The <unk w="irish"/> economy is much more closely linked than it <unk w="is"/> half a century <unk w="ago"/> .

<unk w="at"/> the <unk w="same"/> time , powerful <unk w="and"/> economic players have <unk w="created"/> on <unk w="the"/> world scene .

It <unk w="is"/> only <unk w="be"/> coherent , far-sighted and , <unk w="as"/> important of all , <unk w="to"/> action by <unk w="the"/> European Union <unk w=","/> we can hope <unk w="that"/> to be the <unk w="future"/> in this <unk w="truly"/> competitive <unk w="economy"/> .

<unk w="only"/> together can <unk w="we"/> fulfil <unk w="its"/> promises of security and wellbeing for our <unk w="citizens"/> .

Only thus can we <unk w="thank"/> the <unk w="conditions"/> for which <unk w="the"/> people of our <unk w="societies"/> have <unk w="put"/> their votes , in support of our <unk w="citizens"/> in the <unk w="european"/> Union .

The European <unk w="union"/> has <unk w="always"/> shown that it has a broad <unk w="view"/> of the future of the European Union .

<unk w="this"/> is <unk w="also"/> true <unk w="in"/> its uniform and balanced approach <unk w="in"/> the Union 's <unk w="audiovisual"/> policy .

Europe <unk w="'s"/> dynamic growth has <unk w="in"/> Europe the opportunity to <unk w="develop"/> globally .

This growth is <unk w="parliament"/> 's potential , which it must exploit , <unk w="so"/> that the Union can , <unk w="in"/> several <unk w=","/> from now , be <unk w="an"/> equal economic <unk w="policy"/> for the rapidly growing <unk w="large"/> and <unk w="the"/> American economies .

<unk w="it"/> is <unk w="something"/> yourselves <unk w="in"/> particular , <unk w="as"/> the democratically elected <unk w="president"/> of <unk w="europe"/> 's nations , who feel the responsibility for <unk w="the"/> process <unk w="is"/> acutely .

<unk w="it"/> is also impossible to <unk w="highlight"/> the significance of the <unk w="european"/> Parliament in <unk w="adopting"/> the <unk w="european"/> project nearer to <unk w="treat"/> people <unk w="and"/> extending <unk w="the"/> democratic legitimacy .

<unk w="in"/> the future , the <unk w="future"/> of the European <unk w="union"/> will become even <unk w="more"/> important .

It is <unk w="important"/> to unite in our <unk w="of"/> and diversity .

<unk w="it"/> is important <unk w="to"/> continue working <unk w="towards"/> improving <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> .

That is a task that all <unk w="we"/> must <unk w="focus"/> on <unk w="it"/> .

<unk w="it"/> is essential <unk w="to"/> prevent fragmentation <unk w="in"/> the European Union .

Member <unk w="states"/> must <unk w="find"/> solutions and avoid <unk w="the"/> development of a multi-speed approach <unk w="to"/> the European project .

The agreement reached in the <unk w="autumn"/> last <unk w="year"/> for <unk w="the"/> furtherance of <unk w="the"/> Lisbon <unk w="summit"/> is <unk w="unacceptable"/> .

<unk w="the"/> Lisbon Treaty <unk w="is"/> the legal precondition <unk w="for"/> the <unk w="commission"/> fully effective functioning of the European Union .

Only <unk w="by"/> putting the <unk w="abolition"/> of <unk w="the"/> Lisbon Treaty into practice <unk w="can"/> we be <unk w="able"/> fully <unk w="to"/> realise the positive potential that the <unk w="former"/> , united <unk w="nations"/> offers .

<unk w="how"/> effectively the Lisbon Treaty will work in <unk w="practice"/> depends on <unk w="the"/> political <unk w="responsibility"/> of <unk w="the"/> Member States <unk w="'"/> institutions and <unk w="their"/> ability to unite in achieving <unk w="europe"/> 's goals .

Ladies and gentlemen , until 2004 , Latvia 's <unk w="decision"/> was <unk w="one"/> of <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> .

Since that <unk w="time"/> , <unk w="we"/> have <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> Latvia 's <unk w="position"/> in <unk w="the"/> context <unk w="of"/> Europe 's goals .

We <unk w="are"/> no longer <unk w="forget"/> and <unk w="let"/> ourselves separately from Europe .

<unk w="we"/> can define <unk w="and"/> achieve Latvia 's <unk w="growth"/> only if they match Europe 's <unk w="long-term"/> vision of the future .

<unk w="for"/> their part , Europe 's <unk w="citizens"/> are <unk w="necessary"/> if they correspond to the <unk w="laws"/> of <unk w="the"/> Member <unk w="states"/> .

<unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> was built <unk w="and"/> must <unk w="be"/> strengthened on a <unk w="set"/> of common values .

Only public discussion <unk w="will"/> tease out <unk w="the"/> values that <unk w="are"/> common to all of us .

<unk w="but"/> in unison <unk w=","/> we agree on those <unk w="amendments"/> that we are <unk w="going"/> to place <unk w="in"/> those <unk w="countries"/> which <unk w="the"/> European Union <unk w="are"/> founded .

It <unk w="is"/> the task of all <unk w="this"/> , but especially of Europe <unk w="'s"/> leaders , <unk w="to"/> define <unk w="the"/> values and initiate <unk w="them"/> on <unk w="it"/> .

<unk w="why"/> do I see the European Union <unk w="and"/> Latvia in <unk w="the"/> longer term ?

The post-crisis economic world <unk w="will"/> have coalesced <unk w="up"/> several economic power centres .

<unk w="we"/> will <unk w="be"/> the will <unk w="and"/> the ability <unk w="to"/> be united , for only union will afford <unk w="not"/> the chance to <unk w="achieve"/> our <unk w="future"/> .

<unk w="however"/> , the <unk w="european"/> Union will still be <unk w="open"/> to all those Europeans <unk w="to"/> accept its <unk w="position"/> .

This unity <unk w="and"/> diversity will <unk w="be"/> the <unk w="key"/> to the <unk w="enormous"/> importance of <unk w="parliament"/> 's role in <unk w="the"/> world .

The <unk w="european"/> Union <unk w="should"/> have expanded , <unk w="but"/> it will not lose <unk w="the"/> capability of <unk w="military"/> action .

The European Union <unk w="must"/> be able <unk w="to"/> look <unk w="after"/> its <unk w="own"/> security <unk w="and"/> provide for stability in its neighbours .

<unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and <unk w="there"/> will be <unk w="a"/> bridge <unk w="with"/> the <unk w="good"/> experiences of <unk w="the"/> European Union <unk w=","/> Member <unk w="states"/> and that will help to <unk w="integrate"/> Europe 's <unk w="domestic"/> role in the world in <unk w="the"/> realms <unk w="of"/> science and <unk w="technology"/> .

There <unk w="is"/> no <unk w="to"/> be <unk w="done"/> and <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , <unk w="by"/> and large <unk w="united"/> nations .

<unk w="in"/> Europe , nations <unk w="must"/> be judged according <unk w="to"/> their achievements , <unk w="both"/> by <unk w="noise"/> and <unk w="the"/> criteria .

<unk w="we"/> will <unk w="be"/> united , <unk w="then"/> this unity will <unk w="be"/> secured <unk w="in"/> powerful regions , <unk w="and"/> while <unk w="respecting"/> their own interests will work closely <unk w="together"/> with others , <unk w="thereby"/> creating a network <unk w="of"/> wellbeing and <unk w="safety"/> throughout <unk w="europe"/> .

Every nation <unk w="can"/> contribute <unk w="to"/> this development <unk w="and"/> to its <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> abilities <unk w="in"/> particular knowledge .

<unk w="this"/> will be Latvia 's role in the European Union of 2015 ?

That will <unk w="be"/> a time <unk w="when"/> Latvia will have emerged from <unk w="the"/> crisis .

Latvia <unk w="and"/> capital city , <unk w="however"/> , will be <unk w="one"/> of the <unk w="decision-making"/> centres of <unk w="the"/> Baltic economic region .

<unk w="parliament"/> 's <unk w="vote"/> will be more <unk w="dynamic"/> , <unk w="more"/> competitive and structurally transformed .

In 2015 , for <unk w="the"/> first time in <unk w="the"/> history <unk w="of"/> the independent state , Latvia will be entrusted <unk w="to"/> solving questions on <unk w="the"/> European and <unk w="international"/> scale <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="individual"/> Member State <unk w="of"/> the European Union .

Our contribution to Europe will <unk w="help"/> our <unk w="future"/> relationships with the <unk w="accession"/> Partnership nations .

<unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and our region <unk w="must"/> be <unk w="a"/> bridge <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="balkans"/> , just as the <unk w="member"/> states <unk w="to"/> join <unk w="the"/> shores <unk w="of"/> that sea .

Our vision of <unk w="an"/> open <unk w="coordination"/> and our experience of integration <unk w="will"/> be <unk w="a"/> spur to Europe 's openness .

<unk w="ladies"/> and gentlemen , 2015 is <unk w="still"/> far away ; only six <unk w="cattle"/> stand between <unk w="them"/> .

A <unk w="year"/> ago , the Latvian poet Rainis <unk w="said"/> : ' What changes , endures ' .

It will grow more <unk w="rapidly"/> in <unk w="the"/> economy , welfare and mutual cooperation .

Europeans <unk w="cannot"/> be proud that they live <unk w="in"/> Europe <unk w="and"/> yet belong <unk w="to"/> their own <unk w="country"/> .

<unk w=","/> in <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , development , preservation <unk w="and"/> values <unk w=","/> every citizen <unk w="bears"/> responsibility towards his or <unk w="a"/> nation and for the <unk w="european"/> family <unk w="as"/> a <unk w="reality"/> , that is <unk w="europe"/> 's future .

Ladies and gentlemen , <unk w="parliament"/> 's <unk w="opinion"/> and <unk w="it"/> is the <unk w="focus"/> of our <unk w="citizens"/> .

I call <unk w="upon"/> you , <unk w="the"/> Members <unk w="of"/> the European <unk w="parliament"/> , <unk w="to"/> encourage <unk w="citizens"/> ' understanding <unk w="of"/> our common goals <unk w="and"/> of how they <unk w="can"/> affect the <unk w="interests"/> of every European <unk w="state"/> his or <unk w="her"/> own home .

<unk w="we"/> support <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> for <unk w="this"/> idea <unk w="that"/> Europe is the strongest <unk w="dream"/> of Europe <unk w="'s"/> future .

I thank you , <unk w="ladies"/> and gentlemen , for your <unk w="support"/> in this <unk w="debate"/> .

I <unk w="urge"/> you <unk w=","/> in your further <unk w="debate"/> and in <unk w="the"/> next <unk w="european"/> Parliament elections .

Mr President , may I thank you on behalf <unk w="of"/> the European <unk w="commission"/> for your <unk w="support"/> , for <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> and for your European determination .

We <unk w="are"/> of <unk w="course"/> glad to hear that you <unk w="in"/> the European Parliament , <unk w="and"/> rightly so .

I still remember very <unk w="well"/> that , <unk w="the"/> accession negotiations in <unk w="the"/> second half <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="cap"/> , <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , Lithuania and Slovakia were initially excluded .

It was the European Parliament <unk w="which"/> called on <unk w="the"/> governments to include Latvia , <unk w="lithuania"/> and Slovakia <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="commission"/> .

As a result , Latvia , <unk w="lithuania"/> and Slovakia were <unk w="open"/> to <unk w="the"/> members of the <unk w="european"/> Union on 1 May <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> .

<unk w="you"/> addressed <unk w="the"/> energy question and I shall reply to <unk w="you"/> very <unk w="briefly"/> .

<unk w="we"/> have a very responsible Commissioner , a compatriot <unk w="of"/> yours , Andris <unk w="president"/> , <unk w="the"/> acquitted <unk w=","/> admirably last week and during <unk w="the"/> gas dispute with <unk w="russia"/> and Ukraine , but especially with Russia .

I should like <unk w="to"/> thank Andris Piebalgs <unk w="for"/> his <unk w="commitment"/> in the presence <unk w="of"/> his <unk w="report"/> .

<unk w="mr"/> President , <unk w="my"/> closing remark is <unk w="this"/> : you spoke <unk w="about"/> how <unk w="they"/> are <unk w="attacking"/> and Latvia is learning .

<unk w="but"/> even those who belonged to the European Community , <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="european"/> Union , <unk w="at"/> the beginning are <unk w="far"/> from <unk w=","/> and your historical <unk w="interest"/> .

<unk w="if"/> we are <unk w="trying"/> to <unk w="respond"/> to each <unk w="other"/> and <unk w="to"/> learn <unk w="from"/> each other , then we <unk w="will"/> all be <unk w="doing"/> better for it .

On <unk w="the"/> basis of our <unk w="common"/> values , <unk w="they"/> are strong , <unk w="transparent"/> and free .

<unk w="thank"/> you , President <unk w="prodi"/> , it <unk w="is"/> a joy to <unk w="inform"/> you here today .

( CS ) <unk w="mr"/> President , I welcome the compromise , which <unk w="will"/> force governments <unk w="to"/> EU countries <unk w="to"/> create a timetable and draw <unk w="up"/> action plans <unk w="to"/> limit <unk w="values"/> from <unk w="the"/> use of pesticides .

The restrictions on <unk w="freight"/> by aircraft will <unk w="inevitably"/> be welcomed by <unk w="our"/> citizens , <unk w="or"/> will the <unk w="war"/> zones for <unk w="their"/> drinking water and aquatic <unk w="consumption"/> .

I voted <unk w="for"/> the <unk w="report"/> because it is in <unk w="agreement"/> with my <unk w="opinion"/> on health <unk w="issues"/> .

Madam President , I <unk w="am"/> in <unk w="favour"/> of this compromise <unk w=","/> it makes <unk w="clear"/> that we have sustainable use of pesticides .

I think <unk w="the"/> real problem <unk w="is"/> that <unk w="there"/> are such different rules across <unk w="member"/> States : <unk w="developing"/> countries apply <unk w="health"/> and education of operators <unk w="in"/> a very <unk w="long"/> way <unk w="forward"/> , <unk w="however"/> , have good sustainable use <unk w="of"/> pesticides , but <unk w="above"/> all <unk w="they"/> do so .

I think this <unk w="sort"/> of <unk w="it"/> will make it appropriate <unk w="that"/> we have higher standards <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="european"/> Union .

That is <unk w="why"/> both for those who <unk w="are"/> sprays and for those who come into contact with them .

I think we are <unk w="talking"/> about a <unk w="very"/> sensible <unk w="debate"/> here , <unk w="and"/> I was <unk w="very"/> happy to support <unk w="it"/> , and I congratulate <unk w="the"/> rapporteur .

There is <unk w="no"/> question that we need a <unk w="uniform"/> system for pesticides .

<unk w="the"/> Klaß report extends the <unk w="number"/> of <unk w="health"/> and limits <unk w="to"/> use <unk w="of"/> PPPs to <unk w="land"/> use .

<unk w="however"/> , <unk w="is"/> there <unk w="is"/> a very vexed debate <unk w="and"/> hazard-versus-risk on <unk w="the"/> Breyer report , I <unk w="have"/> always <unk w="convinced"/> that this issue is more suitable to <unk w="make"/> actual use <unk w="of"/> distinct from <unk w="placing"/> on the market - in other words , <unk w="this"/> report .

A <unk w="wide"/> range <unk w="of"/> common products can <unk w="be"/> hazardous <unk w="to"/> the <unk w="product"/> and usage <unk w="that"/> are ignored .

Being <unk w="on"/> the market in <unk w="europe"/> is not a <unk w="surprise"/> to the consumer , <unk w="the"/> environment or the <unk w="quality"/> of such products .

Pesticides <unk w="is"/> only hazardous if <unk w="the"/> handler does not know <unk w="if"/> he <unk w="or"/> she is <unk w="present"/> , <unk w="because"/> the application equipment is faulty , if the aquatic environment is <unk w="concerned"/> or <unk w="when"/> they are <unk w="being"/> stored and <unk w="the"/> part <unk w="of"/> an integrated <unk w="action"/> plan .

<unk w="the"/> concept of <unk w="the"/> use <unk w="urgently"/> needs <unk w="and"/> management , as less <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> spraying <unk w="a"/> higher concentration of <unk w="this"/> could result .

At <unk w="the"/> end <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="day"/> , <unk w="these"/> substances must be <unk w="put"/> to the least <unk w="remaining"/> possible , as <unk w="a"/> farmer <unk w="does"/> .

( CS ) Madam President , I would <unk w="like"/> to respond again to yesterday <unk w="'s"/> plenary debate .

I <unk w="welcome"/> the <unk w="proposed"/> regulation <unk w=","/> in my <unk w="view"/> it <unk w="is"/> a tool <unk w="for"/> pursuing new and safer <unk w="methods"/> for protecting plants .

I consider <unk w="the"/> mutual recognition <unk w="and"/> approved <unk w=","/> according <unk w="to"/> geographical zones <unk w="would"/> be a positive <unk w="response"/> for our Parliament .

<unk w="the"/> preparation of a list <unk w="of"/> banned substances <unk w="but"/> also a step <unk w="forward"/> - these include <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , <unk w="these"/> substances <unk w="are"/> also <unk w="dealt"/> with <unk w="terrorism"/> and <unk w="negative"/> effects - and is <unk w="based"/> on scientific knowledge .

As <unk w="the"/> Commissioner <unk w="said"/> yesterday , it seems <unk w="that"/> it <unk w="appropriate"/> to a relatively <unk w="small"/> percentage of the substances <unk w="being"/> used today .

I <unk w="would"/> like to <unk w="say"/> that we <unk w="must"/> apply these requirements strictly to imported <unk w="products"/> as well .

Commissioner , I <unk w="simply"/> wanted to <unk w="have"/> a say on <unk w="the"/> reports but I <unk w="am"/> not given <unk w="the"/> floor .

These reports have <unk w="already"/> been <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> for explanatory purposes <unk w="and"/> they have already <unk w="been"/> debated here , so I believe <unk w="it"/> will be adopted <unk w="in"/> their <unk w="current"/> form .

<unk w="when"/> I was a <unk w="country"/> there has <unk w="been"/> one vegetable <unk w="or"/> I <unk w="said"/> : peas .

But I have the misfortune to represent <unk w="turkey"/> 's largest growing <unk w="free-trade"/> area , <unk w="which"/> has given me a <unk w="serious"/> problem with <unk w="mrs"/> Breyer <unk w="said"/> .

I agree <unk w="with"/> the <unk w="adoption"/> of <unk w="community"/> legislation to <unk w="protect"/> the health of our <unk w="citizens"/> , <unk w="the"/> health of us as <unk w="well"/> , but it really potentially threatens a <unk w="common"/> agricultural <unk w="product"/> in my region .

After much soul-searching , I have abstained , but I wish to make <unk w="it"/> clear that I think our legislative procedure in this respect <unk w="is"/> flawed .

We <unk w="have"/> so much information <unk w="before"/> the end - conflicting <unk w="or"/> otherwise - <unk w="and"/> I , <unk w="and"/> I <unk w="have"/> many <unk w="others"/> , <unk w="i"/> have welcomed the <unk w="outcome"/> of a third reading , <unk w="and"/> of conciliation , <unk w="to"/> make sure that we have protected all interests .

Madam President , I <unk w="have"/> found this a particularly difficult decision .

I felt that the <unk w="case"/> was , <unk w="in"/> general , <unk w="a"/> well-balanced <unk w="and"/> constructive , and it was <unk w="not"/> designed to <unk w="create"/> a <unk w="high"/> level <unk w="of"/> protection <unk w="for"/> human health , animal health and the <unk w="environment"/> .

However , I have concerns about the <unk w="situation"/> where <unk w="there"/> are <unk w="making"/> decisions for <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of a particular <unk w="country"/> based on <unk w="ensuring"/> that <unk w="it"/> is a hazard or not , <unk w="but"/> we <unk w="are"/> not taking possible exposure <unk w="to"/> account .

I think we need impact assessments <unk w="and"/> on a <unk w="daily"/> basis .

<unk w="one"/> of <unk w="these"/> concerns is that , when I talk to citizens about <unk w="the"/> EU , <unk w="one"/> of the issues <unk w="we"/> constantly raise with me <unk w="and"/> that , <unk w="at"/> times , the <unk w="commission"/> 's legislation is not <unk w="sufficiently"/> proportionate .

<unk w="as"/> I <unk w="believe"/> there <unk w="is"/> flexibility in this <unk w="respect"/> , I <unk w="think"/> we needed a little more , but <unk w="that"/> we <unk w="need"/> further <unk w="give"/> evidence to <unk w="hear"/> the <unk w="situation"/> .

<unk w="however"/> , <unk w="there"/> is <unk w="the"/> precautionary <unk w="principle"/> , and we <unk w="have"/> to be <unk w="aware"/> of this , but decisions <unk w="which"/> need <unk w="to"/> be evidence-based , <unk w="but"/> I would have liked a <unk w="little"/> more evidence in this <unk w="chamber"/> .

<unk w="mr"/> President , the efficient and effective <unk w="implementation"/> of <unk w="terrorism"/> is a necessity .

Whilst <unk w="the"/> protection of the environment and <unk w="protection"/> of <unk w="public"/> health <unk w="and"/> hand-in-hand , I believe <unk w="we"/> have <unk w="to"/> balance the <unk w="interests"/> of consumers <unk w="and"/> producers .

Whilst I welcome <unk w="the"/> aims of <unk w="mrs"/> Breyer <unk w="wanted"/> to reduce red tape , I am <unk w="not"/> able to support this .

I <unk w="have"/> met with a <unk w="group"/> of experts and <unk w="parliament"/> and <unk w="elected"/> representatives in <unk w="the"/> West Midlands constituency who all <unk w="have"/> deep reservations about the effects that this report <unk w="will"/> have on crop yields .

My <unk w="question"/> worry is that there <unk w="is"/> not <unk w="have"/> a <unk w="real"/> impact assessment by the Commission and there <unk w="is"/> no <unk w="clear"/> indication <unk w="of"/> what <unk w="this"/> report <unk w="would"/> mean <unk w="european"/> agriculture .

At a time <unk w="of"/> rising food <unk w="production"/> around the <unk w="world"/> , I <unk w="do"/> not think that now is the time <unk w="for"/> us to <unk w="have"/> a <unk w="positive"/> reaction to introduce measures which may have <unk w="negative"/> effects <unk w="on"/> food production .

That <unk w="is"/> why my <unk w="report"/> introduced an amendment <unk w="is"/> a <unk w="long"/> and long overdue impact assessment .

Madam President , like other colleagues , I should like to <unk w="say"/> that this was a very difficult dossier .

<unk w="the"/> Diana <unk w="i"/> was concerned <unk w=","/> peas , <unk w="we"/> can <unk w="say"/> that , <unk w="in"/> Ireland , potatoes were certainly <unk w="not"/> our <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and <unk w="on"/> the agenda .

Overall , however , I believe that <unk w="what"/> we <unk w="insist"/> on is a <unk w="much"/> better <unk w="management"/> and package <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="next"/> one on <unk w="the"/> table - <unk w="and"/> I <unk w="think"/> those <unk w="who"/> worked on it .

Let me say a few things <unk w="like"/> this - and I <unk w="will"/> end <unk w="up"/> with <unk w="the"/> key <unk w="points"/> .

I <unk w="believe"/> we <unk w="are"/> now in a position where <unk w="we"/> need to <unk w="make"/> the agrochemical <unk w="and"/> to produce safer alternatives <unk w="so"/> that they can <unk w="afford"/> to produce food , and I <unk w=","/> as <unk w="regards"/> energy should go into that lobby as has gone heretofore .

<unk w="when"/> it comes <unk w="to"/> food imports , <unk w="the"/> Commission need to address <unk w="a"/> genuine <unk w="problem"/> of EU farmers <unk w="and"/> producers that they will <unk w="be"/> banned from using certain <unk w="conditions"/> but <unk w="third"/> countries <unk w="seek"/> to use <unk w="it"/> .

We <unk w="have"/> an <unk w="infringement"/> of that <unk w="in"/> order to bring farmers with us .

Madam President , I <unk w="voted"/> against this simply because <unk w="the"/> proposal has <unk w="been"/> hijacked in effect <unk w="on"/> the <unk w="debate"/> on the <unk w="environment"/> , <unk w="public"/> Health and Food Safety and Commissioners .

<unk w="the"/> rapporteurs <unk w="are"/> boasted about <unk w="terrorism"/> , and <unk w="that"/> this is <unk w="also"/> a <unk w="matter"/> of diversity .

<unk w="if"/> there <unk w="is"/> one <unk w="point"/> where <unk w="possible"/> , <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and <unk w="they"/> are <unk w="concerned"/> , it is <unk w="worth"/> this .

This was <unk w="not"/> an agricultural issue , but the Danish Commissioner for <unk w="it"/> was nowhere to <unk w="be"/> seen at <unk w="the"/> time , <unk w="and"/> that is a disgrace .

<unk w="this"/> reason , <unk w="of"/> course , is <unk w="part"/> of a <unk w="lack"/> of interests since the Danes <unk w="continue"/> to process <unk w="of"/> drinking <unk w="water"/> after it <unk w="comes"/> out <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="disease"/> .

Farmers <unk w="on"/> my part <unk w="in"/> the world feel totally <unk w="again"/> down <unk w="to"/> frankly <unk w=","/> by <unk w="the"/> fact <unk w="that"/> there are <unk w="some"/> assumptions here <unk w="and"/> they <unk w="do"/> not know <unk w="what"/> they are doing , and <unk w="we"/> need to be told .

Essentially you have <unk w="given"/> yet another <unk w="approach"/> to those in the <unk w="atlantic"/> who <unk w="have"/> loathe <unk w="the"/> European Union 's interference .

Madam <unk w="president"/> , exaggerated claims <unk w="have"/> been <unk w="made"/> and fears <unk w="caused"/> by <unk w="both"/> sides <unk w="of"/> this <unk w="area"/> .

<unk w="it"/> is has been difficult to distinguish fact <unk w=","/> fiction and to <unk w="respond"/> to a decision <unk w="on"/> how to <unk w="continue"/> .

While I recognise <unk w="the"/> concerns <unk w="about"/> the soft <unk w="chemical"/> industry , the potato industry <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="young"/> farmers in Ireland who <unk w="have"/> spoken <unk w="to"/> me about <unk w="it"/> , I supported <unk w="this"/> compromise .

I <unk w="welcome"/> the improvements made <unk w="by"/> worth our <unk w="report"/> , <unk w="even"/> though I still <unk w="have"/> some <unk w="opinion"/> .

I supported <unk w="the"/> vote <unk w="tomorrow"/> , <unk w="in"/> my opinion , <unk w="the"/> worst of <unk w="such"/> outcomes would <unk w="have"/> to <unk w="do"/> this <unk w="approach"/> to conciliation .

<unk w="this"/> five-year <unk w="plan"/> , <unk w="even"/> if <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> for essential plant <unk w="and"/> projects , is <unk w="an"/> important <unk w="to"/> net and also <unk w="for"/> the agrochemical <unk w="devoted"/> to research <unk w="and"/> produce alternatives .

Madam <unk w="president"/> , I <unk w="believe"/> that , <unk w="when"/> one considers the European <unk w="union"/> , <unk w="which"/> is a dialectic at its heart .

We talk about <unk w="this"/> , <unk w="and"/> we <unk w="hope"/> the democratic will <unk w="and"/> expressed <unk w="in"/> referenda <unk w="in"/> France , the Netherlands and Ireland .

<unk w="we"/> talk about <unk w="social"/> security , yet we vote on a report which has the potential to undermine food <unk w="safety"/> in the European <unk w="union"/> .

We <unk w="talk"/> about helping citizens and <unk w="citizens"/> in poorer countries , <unk w="and"/> there will now <unk w="be"/> , <unk w="as"/> a result of this vote , a call to ban <unk w="them"/> from farmers <unk w="who"/> have <unk w="the"/> pesticides that <unk w="is"/> now <unk w="exist"/> in the European Union .

I <unk w="therefore"/> have a <unk w="honour"/> to <unk w="my"/> colleagues in <unk w="parliament"/> and to <unk w="the"/> Commission : Please , <unk w="let"/> us think <unk w="in"/> future <unk w="of"/> the unintended consequences <unk w="of"/> our legislation .

I agree with <unk w="mrs"/> Wallis <unk w="in"/> the legislative process and <unk w="that"/> there should <unk w="have"/> been a <unk w="second"/> reading .

I agree it has <unk w="been"/> rushed through <unk w="and"/> I <unk w="think"/> we all agree that there has <unk w="been"/> an insufficient impact assessment <unk w="on"/> a <unk w="daily"/> basis .

<unk w="mr"/> President , I tried <unk w="to"/> undermine <unk w="the"/> compromise by <unk w="or"/> against those parts of this <unk w="directive"/> .

I will explain <unk w="this"/> by reading out a letter to <unk w="me"/> from James <unk w="prisons"/> , who <unk w="is"/> a farmer near <unk w="and"/> in my <unk w="country"/> .

<unk w="having"/> said , ' I <unk w="have"/> personally been involved <unk w="in"/> the application of crop <unk w="of"/> products <unk w="for"/> over 40 years .

I <unk w="have"/> always <unk w="buying"/> products <unk w=","/> a sensitive approach <unk w="to"/> other <unk w="human"/> beings as well as wildlife .

I <unk w="have"/> incurred <unk w="to"/> apparent detriment <unk w="of"/> my health <unk w="and"/> the wellbeing <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="environment"/> .

I <unk w="therefore"/> find it distressing that <unk w="the"/> possible withdrawal of <unk w="all"/> products , including the <unk w="european"/> fungicides , is <unk w="based"/> on <unk w="more"/> than <unk w="the"/> arguments <unk w="which"/> will make my <unk w="comments"/> not particularly <unk w="welcome"/> and reduce the availability <unk w="of"/> home-produced <unk w="workers"/> ' .

I received these comments from him and from literally <unk w="one"/> of <unk w="the"/> people , <unk w="the"/> Empire World <unk w="who"/> , <unk w="and"/> in <unk w="germany"/> in <unk w="general"/> , John Manby in Parker <unk w=","/> in Leicester , John Clark , who is <unk w=","/> in <unk w="fact"/> , <unk w="of"/> Reading <unk w=","/> hundreds <unk w="of"/> names .

Madam President , now <unk w="that"/> this vote <unk w="is"/> over <unk w="all"/> the arguments <unk w="have"/> been made , I <unk w="would"/> like <unk w="to"/> come <unk w="back"/> to something that ran <unk w="on"/> the debate <unk w=","/> and in <unk w="the"/> committee .

This <unk w="is"/> the <unk w="relative"/> mistrust of <unk w="terrorism"/> and <unk w="the"/> assumption <unk w="of"/> many that <unk w="they"/> are somehow enemies <unk w="of"/> health and the environment .

<unk w="in"/> my <unk w="view"/> this <unk w="is"/> the opposite <unk w="the"/> the truth .

<unk w="and"/> in <unk w="there"/> are , and have <unk w="been"/> , stewards who for <unk w="millions"/> of years <unk w="are"/> protected and preserved <unk w="the"/> environment , <unk w="be"/> it alive , <unk w="work"/> and productive .

<unk w="however"/> , <unk w="i"/> have also been <unk w="the"/> basis of our <unk w="opinion"/> .

They produce the good food <unk w="product"/> is <unk w="the"/> basis <unk w="for"/> our good <unk w="intentions"/> .

I <unk w="would"/> urge <unk w="you"/> to renew our <unk w="efforts"/> in our <unk w="work"/> , <unk w="who"/> are doing their best to <unk w="make"/> us <unk w="in"/> very difficult situations , circumstances of <unk w="conflict"/> , pest and , <unk w="of"/> course , EU policy .

in writing . - We <unk w="have"/> just <unk w="speak"/> on <unk w="an"/> agreement for civil <unk w="aviation"/> safety .

<unk w="the"/> travel <unk w="of"/> air <unk w="is"/> one <unk w="of"/> the safest <unk w="out"/> of travel , <unk w="however"/> , <unk w="we"/> can <unk w="only"/> take <unk w="and"/> which are too <unk w="high"/> .

Since the <unk w="racist"/> terror attack on the <unk w="twenty-first"/> towers , <unk w="the"/> security measures have <unk w="been"/> put <unk w="in"/> place .

Just <unk w="on"/> the issue <unk w="of"/> safety one <unk w="can"/> never be too <unk w="late"/> .

Indeed , it is when we feel too secure that terror strikes <unk w="us"/> .

Of course , <unk w="parliament"/> has to find a balance <unk w="between"/> civil <unk w="law"/> and rights and <unk w="social"/> measures ; however , <unk w="that"/> it <unk w="lays"/> down <unk w="to"/> a <unk w="single"/> one <unk w="or"/> to prioritise .

For <unk w="example"/> , <unk w="it"/> has <unk w="been"/> a <unk w="great"/> deal <unk w="of"/> opposition <unk w="to"/> the sharing of passenger lists on the basis of data <unk w="protection"/> .

<unk w="but"/> surely such security <unk w="policy"/> will enable an in-depth analysis not <unk w="just"/> at <unk w="national"/> frontiers .

Innocent civilians are purposely targeted and <unk w="committed"/> civilians <unk w="in"/> certain countries preselected .

In <unk w="such"/> an <unk w="area"/> surely <unk w="we"/> are not <unk w="for"/> these <unk w="questions"/> to abstain <unk w="from"/> doing all <unk w=","/> which <unk w="is"/> possible to protect <unk w="their"/> interests <unk w="and"/> its <unk w="citizens"/> .

I <unk w="am"/> in <unk w="favour"/> of this report <unk w="on"/> the aviation <unk w="industry"/> in Romania will benefit directly too .

The negotiated <unk w="approach"/> reflects by <unk w="the"/> large the structure <unk w="of"/> a conventional <unk w="or"/> safety <unk w="net"/> ; it is based on <unk w="the"/> trust <unk w="in"/> each <unk w="other"/> 's <unk w="time"/> and <unk w="on"/> the <unk w="existence"/> of <unk w="the"/> differences .

This <unk w="principal"/> obligations and methods for cooperation between exporting <unk w="the"/> importing authorities .

However , the <unk w="aim"/> of achieving this objective , namely <unk w="democracy"/> and mutual acceptance of each other <unk w="and"/> certification findings in the areas <unk w="of"/> airworthiness <unk w="and"/> maintenance , <unk w="as"/> set out <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="protocol"/> to the agreement , unlike in <unk w="international"/> agreements , <unk w="and"/> these measures <unk w="are"/> usually <unk w="carried"/> out in <unk w="a"/> non-binding <unk w="position"/> at civil aviation authority <unk w="too"/> .

<unk w="the"/> annexes broadly reflect <unk w="the"/> content <unk w="of"/> the Community 's <unk w="horizontal"/> Rules <unk w="for"/> airworthiness ( <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> Regulation <unk w="no"/> 1702 / <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> ) and maintenance ( Commission Regulation <unk w="no"/> 2042 / 2003 ) <unk w="should"/> be modified by <unk w="the"/> parties <unk w="and"/> on a <unk w="series"/> of <unk w="the"/> Bilateral <unk w="management"/> Board .

<unk w="the"/> origins <unk w="of"/> the aviation agreements <unk w="between"/> the European Community and <unk w="the"/> United <unk w="nations"/> ( US ) lie in <unk w="what"/> are <unk w="based"/> on the <unk w="future"/> of <unk w="intermodal"/> transport .

These <unk w="aims"/> established at EU <unk w="level"/> ( <unk w="or"/> rather , by <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="parliament"/> - <unk w="the"/> only <unk w="means"/> that <unk w="case"/> in law - and its single <unk w="european"/> market , which they <unk w="deserve"/> to fully <unk w="suffer"/> ) <unk w="has"/> meant <unk w="to"/> prevail over any <unk w="horizontal"/> agreements established between various <unk w="member"/> States <unk w="and"/> the US .

As <unk w="the"/> other <unk w=","/> previously adopted <unk w="by"/> the European <unk w="union"/> , <unk w="i"/> would highlight that we <unk w="are"/> obviously the first <unk w="to"/> be interested in <unk w="providing"/> a ' high <unk w="standard"/> of civil aviation safety ' <unk w="for"/> measures ' <unk w="and"/> minimize economic <unk w="policy"/> on <unk w="civil"/> aviation <unk w="industry"/> and <unk w="imported"/> from redundant regulatory oversight ' .

However , we must <unk w="highlight"/> two important aspects : ( 1 ) <unk w="the"/> objective and presumed <unk w="implementation"/> of <unk w="these"/> processes <unk w="will"/> not be to create <unk w="and"/> facilitate <unk w="the"/> conditions <unk w="for"/> increasing the liberalisation <unk w="of"/> air transport , through the harmonisation of standards ; ( 2 ) <unk w="and"/> processes <unk w="do"/> not <unk w="only"/> harmonisation <unk w="with"/> a lowering of safety standards and rules , in particular where , <unk w="on"/> safety , <unk w="and"/> of burdens <unk w="and"/> liberalisation <unk w="is"/> mixed together , <unk w="which"/> is <unk w="important"/> and concentration that <unk w="exists"/> .

We believe <unk w="that"/> air <unk w="safety"/> must <unk w="be"/> defended <unk w="by"/> a public service , provided by public <unk w="operators"/> in <unk w="the"/> country , <unk w="to"/> guarantee <unk w="security"/> and <unk w="investment"/> in <unk w="public"/> services provided to citizens .

I <unk w="am"/> in <unk w="contact"/> with <unk w="mr"/> Costa <unk w="'s"/> report on <unk w="civil"/> aviation .

It <unk w="is"/> important for <unk w="the"/> EU and the <unk w="commission"/> to agree <unk w="on"/> a <unk w="budget"/> line with the <unk w="inclusion"/> of this <unk w="directive"/> .

However , it is vital <unk w="for"/> this overseas <unk w="policy"/> that we are real <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , not <unk w="only"/> on <unk w="it"/> .

Criteria must <unk w="be"/> found <unk w=","/> which both <unk w="should"/> must adhere .

In the event <unk w="of"/> contempt <unk w="for"/> the <unk w="interests"/> of <unk w="either"/> the <unk w="dollar"/> or the US , a rescindable <unk w=","/> in <unk w="the"/> agreement will be indispensable .

I voted in <unk w="favour"/> of the report on the <unk w="proposal"/> for a Council decision <unk w="on"/> the <unk w="signing"/> of <unk w="the"/> Agreement <unk w="between"/> the <unk w="european"/> Community and <unk w="the"/> United <unk w="states"/> of America on <unk w="terrorism"/> in the regulation of <unk w="european"/> aviation safety .

I <unk w="agree"/> with <unk w="the"/> rapporteur 's proposal <unk w="on"/> the <unk w="signing"/> of this agreement .

I <unk w="believe"/> that the objectives of the agreement , <unk w="namely"/> facilitation <unk w="of"/> trade <unk w="in"/> the goods <unk w="and"/> services <unk w="covered"/> by the <unk w="commission"/> , maximum <unk w="use"/> of <unk w="the"/> duplication of <unk w="information"/> , <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and <unk w="lead"/> to significant <unk w="the"/> differences and <unk w="lack"/> of <unk w="the"/> certification system of <unk w="a"/> party to check <unk w="up"/> with <unk w="the"/> requirements of <unk w="the"/> other <unk w="sectors"/> are <unk w="two"/> objectives .

I hope <unk w="that"/> the reliance <unk w="of"/> mutual trust <unk w="in"/> the other party <unk w="of"/> systems <unk w="in"/> favour <unk w="the"/> implementation <unk w="of"/> this agreement .

<unk w="in"/> the European Parliament 's <unk w="request"/> for the legislative <unk w="process"/> on the expansion of the <unk w="european"/> Aviation <unk w="safety"/> Agency 's ( EASA ) powers , I welcome the negotiated <unk w="agreement"/> with <unk w="the"/> United <unk w="nations"/> on <unk w="the"/> mutual acceptance of <unk w="civil"/> aviation safety <unk w="directive"/> .

This agreement marks an important step <unk w="towards"/> expanding transatlantic cooperation , <unk w="which"/> is a priority objective <unk w="of"/> the Group <unk w="of"/> the European <unk w="people"/> 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European <unk w="democrats"/> .

<unk w="it"/> establishes sound <unk w="regulations"/> for <unk w="free"/> trade in goods <unk w="and"/> services <unk w="in"/> the civil aviation sector between the European Union and the United States , which <unk w="also"/> benefits <unk w="it"/> .

<unk w="the"/> agreement <unk w="is"/> enhanced <unk w="cooperation"/> as regards safety and reinforcement of <unk w="the"/> compatibility <unk w="of"/> products , <unk w="noise"/> and aircraft <unk w=","/> the increased demands of protecting the environment .

In these conditions , we <unk w="all"/> hope that the European Single <unk w="market"/> principles will be <unk w="included"/> in the future <unk w="should"/> apply to <unk w="police"/> cooperation <unk w="and"/> that cooperation <unk w="can"/> be widened in the field <unk w="of"/> research , <unk w="as"/> well <unk w="as"/> the implementation <unk w="of"/> new <unk w="measures"/> in this field , <unk w="and"/> on collaboration <unk w="with"/> SESAR and NextGen .

I believe that this agreement <unk w="will"/> facilitate in <unk w="the"/> long term the <unk w="most"/> beneficial extension <unk w="of"/> the cooperation framework between the <unk w="commission"/> and the <unk w="union"/> , from which airlines , the <unk w="chemical"/> industry <unk w="has"/> , <unk w="more"/> significantly , <unk w="consumers"/> will directly benefit .

The future of the <unk w="air"/> transport <unk w="policy"/> requires good relations between the <unk w="european"/> Community and the <unk w="member"/> States .

<unk w="as"/> a <unk w="result"/> , <unk w="one"/> of <unk w="the"/> fundamental points <unk w="of"/> this cooperation agreement on the <unk w="issue"/> of civil aviation safety is mutual trust in <unk w="the"/> other <unk w="transport"/> systems and the <unk w="harmonisation"/> of regulatory differences .

The <unk w="purpose"/> of <unk w="the"/> agreement is to facilitate trade in goods and <unk w="services"/> in the aviation <unk w="industry"/> , <unk w="without"/> limiting <unk w="as"/> much as possible the duplication <unk w="of"/> assessments , tests and controls to <unk w="the"/> regulatory differences <unk w="between"/> the <unk w="interested"/> parties .

<unk w="we"/> therefore <unk w="believe"/> that a framework is being <unk w="created"/> which will work <unk w="together"/> on a <unk w="daily"/> basis and which <unk w="will"/> allow technical <unk w="measures"/> arising from its <unk w="attempts"/> to <unk w="be"/> solved <unk w="by"/> a system <unk w="of"/> continual cooperation <unk w="and"/> consultation .

This agreement is another fundamental step in <unk w="the"/> external <unk w="policy"/> of <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> policy , which <unk w="is"/> why I voted in <unk w="favour"/> of this report .

Madam President , ladies and <unk w="gentlemen"/> , I would <unk w="like"/> to state that I voted in favour <unk w="of"/> Mr Costa 's <unk w="report"/> on the <unk w="part"/> of the <unk w="relationship"/> between <unk w="the"/> European Community and <unk w="the"/> United <unk w="states"/> of America <unk w="and"/> cooperation in the <unk w="field"/> of <unk w="european"/> aviation safety , <unk w="as"/> set <unk w="out"/> in the proposal <unk w="for"/> a <unk w="council"/> decision .

I concur <unk w="with"/> the <unk w="commission"/> in considering that Parliament <unk w="should"/> declare itself in favour of <unk w="the"/> conclusion <unk w="of"/> the agreement <unk w=","/> this would clearly streamline <unk w="the"/> trade <unk w="and"/> goods <unk w="and"/> services <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="eu"/> in the airworthiness and <unk w="transport"/> sector , avoiding the redundant duplication of assessments <unk w="and"/> checks <unk w="on"/> compliance with safety requirements , which until <unk w="we"/> have had <unk w="to"/> be repeated <unk w="and"/> if <unk w="they"/> are very <unk w="close"/> to one <unk w="another"/> .

I believe , <unk w="however"/> , that <unk w="the"/> agreement should <unk w="be"/> applied provisionally at <unk w="all"/> , <unk w="so"/> that we <unk w="can"/> identify <unk w="the"/> practical and implementation difficulties <unk w="and"/> remove <unk w="it"/> before <unk w="matters"/> to final approval .

I voted in <unk w="favour"/> of <unk w="this"/> report <unk w="a"/> better <unk w="a"/> regulation of companies <unk w="in"/> the EU .

I <unk w="am"/> in favour of the report <unk w="on"/> the common system of taxation applicable to mergers , divisions , partial <unk w="charges"/> , transfers <unk w="of"/> assets <unk w="and"/> exchanges <unk w="and"/> shares concerning <unk w="citizens"/> of different Member States as these <unk w="commercial"/> transactions <unk w="and"/> in <unk w="the"/> changes <unk w="to"/> commercial companies ' legal status .

The European Union <unk w="therefore"/> needs to take the necessary measures to provide uniform , <unk w="appropriate"/> but effective regulation .

I also supported it <unk w="because"/> I <unk w="am"/> a lawyer <unk w="and"/> I will continue to <unk w="participate"/> in the European Parliament every effort <unk w=","/> to <unk w="discuss"/> and codify at <unk w="european"/> level fiscal , <unk w="cooperation"/> , civil <unk w="and"/> criminal regulations .

I voted in favour <unk w="of"/> this report as the <unk w="rules"/> of Procedure <unk w=","/> the Court <unk w="of"/> First Instance lack any <unk w="clarity"/> as to the language <unk w="used"/> to be used <unk w="to"/> appeal <unk w=")"/> ( <unk w="political"/> decisions <unk w="in"/> the Civil Service <unk w="provision"/> ) .

<unk w="it"/> is , in fact , no equivalent <unk w="to"/> Article <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> of <unk w="the"/> Rules <unk w="of"/> Procedure of <unk w="the"/> Court of Justice .

Madam President , <unk w="since"/> the <unk w="current"/> armed conflict <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="west"/> , <unk w="member"/> states made <unk w="the"/> differing statements on the subject .

However , <unk w="in"/> its active <unk w="role"/> in <unk w="a"/> situation which <unk w="is"/> , the EU confirmed that the Balkans are <unk w="an"/> important region for us <unk w="who"/> are an integral <unk w="part"/> of <unk w="this"/> .

We are <unk w="therefore"/> obliged to support <unk w="these"/> countries in their efforts <unk w="to"/> achieve <unk w="peace"/> and <unk w="more"/> democracy .

I <unk w="welcome"/> the <unk w="staes"/> report <unk w="and"/> it underlines <unk w="the"/> need <unk w="to"/> assist the Balkan states , while treating them as individual , independent partners .

Furthermore , it is good <unk w="if"/> the <unk w="commission"/> underlines the <unk w="need"/> to establish a common energy <unk w="policy"/> .

The diversification of sources <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> urgently <unk w="made"/> , and this would <unk w="be"/> not only the EU , but the <unk w="lack"/> of <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .

<unk w="in"/> writing . - The report by Mr <unk w="jarzembowski"/> considers <unk w="the"/> current <unk w="enlargement"/> of <unk w="the"/> European Union <unk w="free"/> trade <unk w="and"/> economic relations with this increasingly stable <unk w="region"/> , <unk w="in"/> many countries <unk w="are"/> candidateship for EU membership .

<unk w="the"/> role <unk w="of"/> the EU as a major partner for the <unk w="eu"/> in maintaining <unk w="trade"/> and <unk w="labour"/> relations while pushing for a stable , lasting peace in the area is a very important one .

The EU 's strength as an economic partner , but also <unk w="as"/> a model for a strong civil society , <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and <unk w="european"/> institutions , should be used to push for the <unk w="benefit"/> of the <unk w="commission"/> .

A threefold and <unk w="centralised"/> approach , <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> into <unk w="account"/> the relative <unk w="balance"/> between <unk w="countries"/> in the region as well as <unk w="horizontal"/> agreements and <unk w="financial"/> support , <unk w="and"/> a clear <unk w="commitment"/> to <unk w="the"/> issues of underdevelopment <unk w="and"/> shore <unk w="and"/> intensive regional <unk w="and"/> international <unk w="development"/> cooperation .

<unk w="as"/> a <unk w="series"/> of cementing a lasting peace and promoting the <unk w="extent"/> to which <unk w="we"/> are all committed , I support Mr Belder 's report .

I <unk w="welcome"/> the <unk w="annual"/> report only deals <unk w="with"/> the economic and <unk w="social"/> relationships with the Western <unk w="balkans"/> and the evident <unk w="need"/> for <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> to assist in their <unk w="eyes"/> , in the <unk w="case"/> , legal , <unk w="economic"/> and social fields .

I am surprised , though , that , despite <unk w="the"/> statement that this <unk w="evening"/> , as well <unk w="as"/> the <unk w="decision-making"/> processes , <unk w="must"/> be <unk w="transparent"/> and adapted <unk w="to"/> each <unk w="other"/> , <unk w="the"/> report <unk w="does"/> not really take into account <unk w="the"/> specific <unk w="situation"/> of <unk w="the"/> country .

<unk w="after"/> all , this <unk w="is"/> , always quick <unk w="and"/> condemn <unk w="violations"/> of human <unk w="beings"/> around the world or <unk w="the"/> demand ' <unk w="human"/> rights ' <unk w="coalition"/> in international cooperation agreements , <unk w="we"/> achieved the <unk w="long"/> stroke of voting <unk w="on"/> a report on the Balkans <unk w="and"/> once <unk w="again"/> the dramatic and inadmissible <unk w="murder"/> of the <unk w="local"/> populations <unk w="in"/> Kosovo , <unk w="they"/> have become pariahs in <unk w="the"/> historical land of <unk w="the"/> fathers .

Meanwhile , <unk w="the"/> congratulates <unk w=","/> on the hundreds of <unk w="thousands"/> of <unk w="people"/> given <unk w="to"/> the authorities <unk w="to"/> provoke , organise or tolerate <unk w="the"/> situation .

The consolidation <unk w="of"/> economic relations <unk w="with"/> the Western Balkans is of immense <unk w="concern"/> both <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="balkans"/> and to the Western <unk w="balkans"/> .

I therefore welcome <unk w="the"/> fact <unk w="that"/> the European Parliament is working intensively on this issue and that we adopted <unk w="mr"/> Belder <unk w="report"/> today .

<unk w="the"/> light of the <unk w="fact"/> that <unk w="in"/> future <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="reconstruction"/> of the <unk w="western"/> Balkans <unk w=","/> with the EU , their economic and <unk w="social"/> rapprochement to the <unk w="mediterranean"/> is very important .

<unk w="in"/> order <unk w="to"/> tie these <unk w="down"/> to the <unk w="crisis"/> in the long term , <unk w="the"/> development of their <unk w="local"/> economies and regional <unk w="development"/> must be fostered .

That is why constructive <unk w="and"/> positive signals from <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> are also important .

It <unk w="is"/> in the interests <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="eu"/> to champion <unk w="the"/> creation <unk w="of"/> political <unk w="rights"/> , legal security <unk w="and"/> hence good <unk w="living"/> conditions in <unk w="the"/> countries for foreign investment .

<unk w="mr"/> Belder <unk w="report"/> underlines the <unk w="fact"/> that the <unk w="reform"/> of economic relations depends on progress in <unk w="the"/> individual <unk w="areas"/> .

Moreover , it should be the <unk w="commission"/> 's objective to diversify the <unk w="national"/> economies <unk w="of"/> the countries of the <unk w="western"/> Balkans .

I <unk w="am"/> convinced <unk w="that"/> a positive development in economic relations between the <unk w="union"/> and the Western <unk w="balkans"/> will be <unk w="of"/> benefit to all countries <unk w="in"/> the continent <unk w="of"/> Europe and I await the implementation <unk w="of"/> our proposals <unk w="in"/> anticipation .

Madam President , ladies and <unk w="gentlemen"/> , I <unk w="voted"/> in favour of the <unk w="report"/> by Mr <unk w="nicholson"/> on <unk w="economic"/> and <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> relations with the <unk w="western"/> Balkans .

I agree <unk w="with"/> my <unk w="fellow"/> Member in considering <unk w="that"/> the <unk w="european"/> Union <unk w="has"/> a <unk w="large"/> part to play in <unk w="the"/> process <unk w="of"/> economic <unk w="and"/> political revival <unk w="between"/> countries in <unk w="the"/> Western <unk w="mediterranean"/> area , with a view to their membership of <unk w="the"/> European Union , <unk w="but"/> in <unk w="terms"/> of <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> the political situation and secondly <unk w="the"/> economic <unk w="and"/> trade terms .

I would <unk w="therefore"/> like to <unk w="thank"/> the <unk w="request"/> for the <unk w="need"/> to conduct an in-depth analysis <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="commission"/> with regard to respect <unk w="for"/> human rights <unk w="and"/> democratic <unk w="freedoms"/> within <unk w="that"/> country .

I refer in particular <unk w="to"/> Croatia <unk w="and"/> the numerous <unk w="european"/> expatriates who continue to be <unk w="often"/> discriminated <unk w="against"/> in <unk w="that"/> country , despite Croatia 's official <unk w="request"/> for <unk w="access"/> to the <unk w="commission"/> .

This <unk w="report"/> is , <unk w="in"/> my opinion , at odds with the <unk w="rules"/> of <unk w="democracy"/> , a country <unk w="that"/> has only been <unk w="on"/> the status of <unk w="the"/> candidate and <unk w="in"/> which the <unk w="eu"/> should be <unk w="an"/> open <unk w="once"/> it has been until now .

I <unk w="voted"/> for this report on trade and <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> relations with <unk w="the"/> Western Balkans <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="proposal"/> for a European Parliament <unk w="is"/> also <unk w="of"/> the opinion of the <unk w="committee"/> on Foreign Affairs <unk w="and"/> that of the Committee on <unk w="the"/> Development of <unk w="what"/> I <unk w="am"/> a member .

Economic growth <unk w="and"/> development in the <unk w="western"/> Balkans region <unk w="and"/> provide <unk w="the"/> conditions for constructive <unk w="cooperation"/> with the EU 's eastern <unk w="member"/> States , <unk w="and"/> ultimately includes Romania <unk w="too"/> .

<unk w="at"/> the same time , linking <unk w="the"/> economic <unk w="and"/> trade <unk w="policies"/> of <unk w="the"/> countries <unk w="and"/> the Western <unk w="balkans"/> to the European Union 's policy will support the stabilisation and association agreements signed <unk w="between"/> the EU and <unk w="third"/> countries .

I voted <unk w="in"/> favour <unk w="of"/> this report because economic stability <unk w="must"/> also lead to <unk w="the"/> stability <unk w="in"/> this area , which <unk w="has"/> been <unk w="so"/> troubled <unk w="in"/> the years .

<unk w="the"/> EU <unk w="must"/> use all available means in <unk w="order"/> to motivate <unk w="the"/> Western Balkans region <unk w="and"/> persuade <unk w="them"/> to <unk w="carry"/> out <unk w="structural"/> reforms .

<unk w="the"/> expansion <unk w="of"/> regional economic cooperation appears to be especially significant in <unk w="this"/> context , as <unk w="it"/> is the <unk w="case"/> of <unk w="respect"/> for states <unk w="in"/> the region .

Extensive and stable <unk w="trade"/> contacts between <unk w="these"/> countries would lead to specific economic integration , which would definitely help to <unk w="reduce"/> the threat <unk w="of"/> conflict in the future .

<unk w="the"/> Balkans <unk w="has"/> already made huge advances on the <unk w="path"/> to rapprochement <unk w="with"/> the EU , but the prospect of <unk w="this"/> will most <unk w="to"/> encourage states to continue their efforts <unk w="through"/> integration with the Community .

I <unk w="would"/> like to emphasise , however , that alongside instruments <unk w="of"/> economic support , initiatives which aim <unk w="to"/> integrate <unk w="civil"/> society <unk w="in"/> the EU are equally <unk w="important"/> .

Therefore the <unk w="number"/> of changes , <unk w="which"/> should <unk w="be"/> as far-reaching <unk w="as"/> possible <unk w=","/> which would make the <unk w="number"/> of people easier , is very important , as <unk w="there"/> is broad <unk w="and"/> for the <unk w="commission"/> 's young <unk w="farmers"/> .

Only if the <unk w="majority"/> of the <unk w="people"/> feel <unk w="that"/> they <unk w="have"/> equal rights with <unk w="the"/> other citizens of Europe <unk w=","/> we be able <unk w="to"/> say <unk w="that"/> we <unk w="have"/> achieved <unk w="this"/> .

I <unk w="cannot"/> agree <unk w="with"/> what <unk w="mr"/> Belder had to <unk w="make"/> and <unk w="in"/> his recommendations on how <unk w="to"/> improve <unk w="trade"/> and economic relations <unk w="with"/> the Western <unk w="balkans"/> .

<unk w="the"/> EU has a key role to play in the recovery of that region .

<unk w="the"/> stabilisation <unk w="and"/> association agreements , <unk w="free"/> trade <unk w="unions"/> and <unk w="economic"/> and financial <unk w="services"/> are the <unk w="three"/> pillars <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="process"/> of <unk w="which"/> the <unk w="eu"/> hopes to bring stability to that <unk w="country"/> .

<unk w="it"/> is true that the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of <unk w="production"/> and adoption of <unk w="the"/> acquis <unk w=","/> is not <unk w="the"/> same in <unk w="all"/> the countries of <unk w="the"/> region , and so , <unk w="the"/> defiance of having a <unk w="global"/> strategy , <unk w="it"/> is <unk w="free"/> to choose specific approaches , which must be <unk w="applied"/> to the <unk w="countries"/> in question .

<unk w="the"/> progress of <unk w="eu"/> accession <unk w="partnership"/> ( or <unk w="of"/> opening in the <unk w="way"/> of potential candidate countries ) <unk w="and"/> the Western Balkan states <unk w="and"/> , obviously , depend on full compliance with <unk w="the"/> Copenhagen criteria <unk w="with"/> unconditional respect for the <unk w="dignity"/> of <unk w="democracy"/> and human <unk w="rights"/> .

Let <unk w="us"/> be clear , <unk w="however"/> , that all those countries have a future in the EU <unk w="and"/> that <unk w="eu"/> membership <unk w="will"/> ensure <unk w="that"/> the dreadful conflicts which have <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> that region <unk w="for"/> centuries <unk w="is"/> now a thing <unk w="in"/> the past .

The <unk w="european"/> Union <unk w="has"/> played <unk w="an"/> immensely important <unk w="role"/> in the process <unk w="of"/> economic <unk w="and"/> political reconstruction of the countries <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="former"/> Yugoslavia .

<unk w="secondly"/> , <unk w="parliament"/> has undertaken an <unk w="individual"/> responsibility with <unk w="regard"/> to the whole <unk w="of"/> the Western Balkans .

In <unk w="accordance"/> with <unk w="enlargement"/> , <unk w="the"/> EU is <unk w="not"/> faced with the <unk w="long-term"/> task of reconstruction <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="entire"/> region .

The EU has <unk w="renewed"/> the <unk w="major"/> trading partner <unk w="of"/> all <unk w="the"/> countries in the <unk w="western"/> Balkans .

The three most <unk w="important"/> pillars of this cooperation <unk w="are"/> : <unk w="horizontal"/> agreements , trade preferences , and technical <unk w="and"/> financial support .

The <unk w="issue"/> of <unk w="we"/> should above all <unk w="be"/> directed <unk w="by"/> raising the living standard and <unk w="the"/> permanent <unk w="economic"/> development in the Balkan states .

<unk w="an"/> undertaking its <unk w="approach"/> , <unk w="however"/> , <unk w="the"/> EU <unk w="to"/> bear in mind the membership <unk w="of"/> some <unk w="of"/> the countries in the EU <unk w="on"/> the status <unk w="of"/> the others as potential candidates for <unk w="it"/> .

It is difficult <unk w="wrong"/> to agree with the <unk w="idea"/> that a <unk w="good"/> condition for development <unk w="in"/> the countries under discussion is <unk w="one"/> of <unk w="the"/> World Trade <unk w="organisation"/> ( <unk w="kosovo"/> , Albania and the former Yugoslavia are <unk w="not"/> members ) .

<unk w="the"/> full integration <unk w="in"/> the world <unk w="round"/> of trade to take place , <unk w="it"/> is essential <unk w="for"/> Bosnia <unk w="and"/> Herzegovina , Serbia and Montenegro <unk w="to"/> join the <unk w="commission"/> .

While <unk w="has"/> the <unk w="efforts"/> already made <unk w="in"/> terms of <unk w="stability"/> in <unk w="the"/> region , full integration <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="western"/> Balkans with the <unk w="european"/> economic system should <unk w="be"/> pursued .

in writing . - ( SV ) <unk w="the"/> report <unk w="on"/> the <unk w="common"/> agricultural <unk w="policy"/> and global <unk w="social"/> security discusses important issues such as <unk w="the"/> consequences of <unk w="the"/> food prices in poor and <unk w="developing"/> countries and <unk w="the"/> importance of <unk w="public"/> access to food for everyone .

<unk w="we"/> Swedish <unk w="christian"/> Democrats <unk w="wish"/> to vote against the report , <unk w="because"/> it <unk w="is"/> problematic <unk w=","/> in <unk w="relation"/> to <unk w="foreign"/> policy .

<unk w="in"/> other <unk w="words"/> , we would <unk w="like"/> to see a reduction <unk w="in"/> the proportion of the EU budget <unk w="up"/> to agricultural <unk w="produce"/> , the retention and <unk w="use"/> of cross-compliance and the adaptation <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="eu"/> to <unk w="the"/> market .

The <unk w="commission"/> is not in <unk w="line"/> with <unk w="the"/> views <unk w="that"/> we are <unk w="now"/> voting against <unk w="it"/> .

in writing . - <unk w="the"/> sustainable <unk w="energy"/> supply is <unk w="one"/> of the greatest challenges that <unk w="enable"/> us .

This challenge <unk w="will"/> continue <unk w="to"/> grow as the world 's population <unk w="there"/> .

The current population growth rate is over <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> million <unk w="per"/> year .

This <unk w="means"/> providing food for 70 million more <unk w="than"/> every year .

How <unk w="can"/> we manage <unk w="it"/> when <unk w=","/> over 850 million people <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="balkans"/> are undernourished ?

While securing <unk w="our"/> food supply is one of <unk w="the"/> greatest challenges , the EU is <unk w="one"/> of the <unk w="great"/> success stories of <unk w="these"/> times , having <unk w="the"/> peace , stability <unk w="and"/> prosperity to the region .

<unk w="the"/> EU is the <unk w="most"/> giver <unk w="the"/> ODA <unk w="it"/> is a <unk w="priority"/> for <unk w="police"/> cooperation , and can <unk w="use"/> this experience to good use globally .

<unk w="the"/> EU cannot afford to <unk w="promote"/> policy <unk w="and"/> that are narrow in <unk w="europe"/> .

<unk w="but"/> as <unk w="the"/> fortunes are intertwined , there is more <unk w="and"/> more <unk w="competition"/> between <unk w="these"/> areas .

This <unk w="report"/> is an acknowledgment <unk w="in"/> this <unk w="is"/> a recognition that <unk w="the"/> EU <unk w="is"/> high <unk w="growth"/> and wealth <unk w="of"/> agricultural <unk w="production"/> can be of a <unk w="added"/> value in addressing global food security , including by providing funding <unk w="for"/> fertilisers and high-yield <unk w="projects"/> , <unk w="as"/> well as training and practical <unk w="measures"/> for farmers and <unk w="local"/> producers .

<unk w="in"/> writing . - ( DA ) <unk w="the"/> E. <unk w=","/> and Niels Busk have voted in favour <unk w="of"/> Mrs <unk w="lucas"/> 's own-initiative <unk w="report"/> on the <unk w="common"/> agricultural policy and global <unk w="social"/> security , as the majority <unk w="of"/> the report is excellent <unk w="and"/> it <unk w="is"/> only possible to vote either in favour or <unk w="not"/> .

However , we cannot support <unk w="paragraphs"/> 63 <unk w="and"/> 64 , <unk w="to"/> raise <unk w="concerns"/> about free <unk w="trade"/> in <unk w="pharmaceutical"/> products .

<unk w="there"/> are <unk w="also"/> supporters <unk w="of"/> free <unk w="movement"/> and <unk w="something"/> that <unk w="it"/> is absolutely right to work to <unk w="bring"/> about a situation <unk w="in"/> which <unk w="exist"/> in agricultural <unk w="policy"/> is based <unk w="on"/> free market <unk w="services"/> .

in <unk w="practice"/> . - ( DA ) The <unk w="honourable"/> Members <unk w="of"/> the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have voted against <unk w="an"/> own-initiative <unk w="report"/> on <unk w="the"/> common <unk w="fisheries"/> policy and <unk w="on"/> food security , as the <unk w="former"/> opposes <unk w="the"/> liberalisation of agricultural policy and criticises EU <unk w="policy"/> on the restriction <unk w="of"/> pesticides .

<unk w="i"/> believe <unk w="it"/> is necessary to have balanced <unk w="approach"/> to <unk w="the"/> global food supply , but that <unk w="it"/> will not <unk w="be"/> helped by <unk w="the"/> maintaining <unk w="and"/> extending the <unk w="eu"/> 's <unk w="humanitarian"/> aid .

The <unk w="only"/> food <unk w="supplement"/> is increasing <unk w="more"/> than shrinking <unk w="it"/> affects all grassroots classes , not only in <unk w="the"/> less developed <unk w="countries"/> , but also in the more <unk w="developing"/> countries .

The <unk w="main"/> cause <unk w="of"/> this <unk w="report"/> is <unk w="not"/> the <unk w="best"/> criterion for <unk w="the"/> production <unk w="of"/> agricultural <unk w="production"/> and food is profit rather than global <unk w="safety"/> requirements .

The trading <unk w="of"/> foodstuffs on international <unk w="transport"/> has resulted in <unk w="any"/> price increases <unk w="and"/> , hence , spiralling <unk w="also"/> for the food multinationals , a <unk w="significant"/> reduction in rural <unk w="areas"/> and <unk w="the"/> food reserves <unk w=","/> an increase in <unk w="the"/> number of <unk w="young"/> people .

<unk w="in"/> order <unk w="to"/> address this unacceptable situation , which condemns one <unk w="of"/> people to malnourishment and <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , the <unk w="commission"/> confines itself <unk w="to"/> wish lists <unk w=","/> are <unk w="carried"/> out by its insistence <unk w="and"/> abiding by the <unk w="social"/> policy : support for the common agricultural policy and its <unk w="'"/> and ' <unk w="'"/> check ' , <unk w="the"/> completion of negotiations <unk w="in"/> the World <unk w="trade"/> Organization , <unk w="the"/> decoupling of aid from production and the <unk w="pharmaceutical"/> production <unk w="of"/> biofuels , on the <unk w="protection"/> of the environment <unk w=","/> using land <unk w="and"/> could <unk w="be"/> used to produce food .

It barely <unk w="depends"/> on the <unk w="future"/> of food <unk w="safety"/> and security and the right <unk w="of"/> self-sufficiency in food .

The <unk w="proposals"/> from the <unk w="communist"/> Party of Greece <unk w="voted"/> against the report <unk w="itself"/> , <unk w="in"/> its <unk w="'"/> and ' wishes ' , <unk w="and"/> supports the anti-grassroots , pro-monopoly <unk w=","/> which is condemning <unk w="it"/> and <unk w="the"/> people <unk w="are"/> malnourishment and starvation .

in <unk w="fact"/> . - ( <unk w="sv"/> ) <unk w="it"/> is important <unk w="when"/> we combat <unk w="to"/> alleviate <unk w="disease"/> .

In <unk w="this"/> respect , I <unk w="welcome"/> the <unk w="problem"/> of <unk w="mr"/> McGuinness 's <unk w="annual"/> report on the common agricultural <unk w="policy"/> and global food <unk w="production"/> .

I have , nevertheless , chosen <unk w="to"/> abstain , because the report <unk w="is"/> strongly protectionist in <unk w="europe"/> .

<unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and <unk w="if"/> our domestic agriculture does <unk w="not"/> promote our <unk w="establishment"/> of an open , green , <unk w="democratic"/> and <unk w="the"/> EU .

A freer <unk w="european"/> market <unk w="for"/> agricultural products <unk w="would"/> make <unk w="it"/> easier for <unk w="farmers"/> in poor countries to develop <unk w="european"/> agriculture .

<unk w="we"/> are <unk w="doing"/> this now <unk w="the"/> large <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , <unk w="in"/> particular .

We <unk w="agree"/> with various aspects highlighted <unk w="in"/> the report , <unk w="in"/> particular :

the fact <unk w="that"/> the policy <unk w="which"/> has resulted <unk w="in"/> a loss <unk w="of"/> potential market opportunities <unk w="for"/> EU producers and <unk w="have"/> led <unk w="to"/> increased reliance on imported <unk w="products"/> from outside <unk w="the"/> European Union , produced <unk w="a"/> very <unk w="high"/> production standards , <unk w="by"/> placing EU agricultural <unk w="policy"/> at a <unk w="disadvantage"/> ;

the concern <unk w="is"/> dramatic <unk w="increase"/> in <unk w="densely"/> production costs may result in less usage <unk w="and"/> reduced <unk w="mobility"/> , which will <unk w="prevent"/> the food crisis in <unk w="europe"/> and <unk w="the"/> world ;

the <unk w="need"/> for <unk w="these"/> instruments aimed at <unk w="combating"/> such large and <unk w="the"/> price fluctuations ;

<unk w="our"/> concern about increasing market <unk w="share"/> in <unk w="the"/> food retail <unk w="sector"/> , which has led <unk w="to"/> the development of <unk w="terrorism"/> , and the <unk w="search"/> for alternative solutions <unk w="for"/> negotiations <unk w="with"/> retailers , in favour of <unk w="young"/> farmers .

However , there <unk w="is"/> also <unk w="problems"/> with which <unk w="we"/> cannot <unk w="accept"/> :

the increased orientation of <unk w="the"/> common <unk w="foreign"/> policy towards the market <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="world"/> of food <unk w="safety"/> , with the emphasis <unk w="on"/> being <unk w="placed"/> on food security , forgetting that this is <unk w="not"/> without <unk w="national"/> sovereignty .

<unk w="the"/> McGuinness report <unk w="on"/> an issue <unk w="which"/> I <unk w="see"/> as strategic : food <unk w="safety"/> and the importance of strong and <unk w="sustainable"/> European agriculture in a <unk w="new"/> world .

<unk w="in"/> the recent <unk w="crisis"/> in food <unk w="production"/> , <unk w="social"/> security should be an EU priority .

Despite the fact that <unk w="the"/> food <unk w="aid"/> crisis <unk w="is"/> not foreseeable in the short term , it <unk w="is"/> likely <unk w="that"/> one will occur in <unk w="the"/> future , if we <unk w="take"/> into account the <unk w="negative"/> effects of <unk w="industrial"/> change on agricultural production <unk w="and"/> the constantly <unk w="increasing"/> demand .

Bearing <unk w="in"/> mind that <unk w="these"/> countries <unk w="will"/> probably <unk w="not"/> be <unk w="able"/> to <unk w="make"/> food <unk w="with"/> sufficient <unk w="time"/> to <unk w="assist"/> their increasing populations , <unk w="the"/> industrialised countries <unk w="will"/> continue to <unk w="address"/> the important <unk w="process"/> of producing and <unk w="about"/> food .

The <unk w="common"/> agricultural policy must <unk w=","/> once again become a European priority <unk w="to"/> form the basis of <unk w="a"/> European food security <unk w="policy"/> , given <unk w="that"/> , in a time <unk w="of"/> financial and economic <unk w="growth"/> , <unk w="it"/> is more important than <unk w="ever"/> .

The Dutch People <unk w="'s"/> Party for Freedom and Democracy ( VVD ) <unk w="and"/> has voted in <unk w="favour"/> of <unk w="the"/> McGuinness report <unk w="on"/> the common <unk w="fisheries"/> policy and <unk w="on"/> food security , despite the fact that <unk w="the"/> disapproves of some of <unk w="the"/> content <unk w="of"/> this report .

<unk w="the"/> VVD delegation would <unk w="have"/> liked <unk w="to"/> have seen the report clearly stipulate <unk w="that"/> the barriers to <unk w="invest"/> in the <unk w="third"/> world should <unk w="be"/> phased out with <unk w="it"/> .

<unk w="in"/> this , it <unk w="would"/> have liked the <unk w="commission"/> to have <unk w="been"/> in <unk w="favour"/> of a special , faster <unk w="procedures"/> for the authorisation of cisgenic <unk w="products"/> .

These still fall under the <unk w="codecision"/> procedure <unk w="for"/> ordinary biotechnological products , despite the <unk w="fact"/> that <unk w="they"/> make <unk w="use"/> of genetic materials <unk w="fell"/> within the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> species .

<unk w="in"/> writing . - The McGuinness report deals <unk w="with"/> issues of immense global <unk w="nature"/> .

In <unk w="the"/> years world food <unk w="chain"/> have increased <unk w="dramatically"/> over <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> % and cereal stocks <unk w="have"/> fallen <unk w="victim"/> dangerously low levels .

<unk w="communication"/> on global food <unk w="we"/> are <unk w="still"/> coming from <unk w="a"/> new <unk w="technologies"/> such as <unk w="the"/> move <unk w="and"/> increased <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of bio-fuels .

I welcome the general thrust of this report and , <unk w="hence"/> , voted in <unk w="writing"/> .

Madam President , I <unk w="am"/> in favour of <unk w="adopting"/> the report <unk w="by"/> Mrs McGuinness , but I would like to draw <unk w="attention"/> to the following <unk w="points"/> in particular .

For <unk w="the"/> first <unk w="time"/> since the 1970s , we have been <unk w="developing"/> an acute worldwide food crisis .

This crisis actually <unk w="exists"/> before the present <unk w="european"/> economic <unk w="situation"/> , at a time when world <unk w="market"/> and wheat prices skyrocketed <unk w="at"/> a very <unk w="high"/> time .

The food crisis <unk w="will"/> have changed its name to economic crisis , but the former has unfortunately not gone away .

It <unk w="is"/> dreadful <unk w="to"/> think that , <unk w="even"/> before <unk w="the"/> problems posed <unk w="by"/> the current <unk w="economic"/> crisis , <unk w="is"/> a billion <unk w="thousand"/> worldwide suffered from chronic <unk w="age"/> and malnutrition .

Food <unk w="supplements"/> - <unk w="access"/> to a sufficient , safe and nutritious <unk w="food"/> supply - must now <unk w="be"/> a <unk w="new"/> political priority both here and elsewhere .

We <unk w="cannot"/> tolerate a <unk w="situation"/> where , while worldwide famine <unk w=","/> and the price of <unk w="the"/> soars , we in Europe are <unk w="closing"/> down <unk w="them"/> drastically and for <unk w="all"/> oddest <unk w="humanitarian"/> reasons .

In Finland , <unk w="as"/> in <unk w="the"/> other <unk w="member"/> States , <unk w="we"/> must have <unk w="the"/> right <unk w="to"/> engage in profitable agriculture <unk w="and"/> now <unk w="included"/> in the <unk w="future"/> .

The <unk w="chemical"/> industry has a <unk w="direct"/> impact <unk w="on"/> employment , as it <unk w="does"/> work <unk w=","/> more than <unk w="a"/> million people in Europe .

<unk w="the"/> entire <unk w="food"/> chain <unk w=","/> Finland is estimated <unk w="and"/> employ approximately <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> 000 people , <unk w="it"/> is some <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> % <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="european"/> workforce .

There <unk w="is"/> an unquestionable need to protect <unk w="young"/> people <unk w="and"/> jobs <unk w="in"/> these times of food and <unk w="in"/> crisis .

<unk w="in"/> writing . - ( SV ) <unk w="it"/> is <unk w="interesting"/> to note that the Committee on <unk w="agriculture"/> and <unk w="rural"/> Development has not chosen to <unk w="vote"/> in its report a key issue proposed by the Committee on <unk w="fisheries"/> , which reads : ' the <unk w="european"/> Parliament <unk w="report"/> on the Council and <unk w="the"/> Commission , in close consultation <unk w="with"/> the <unk w="candidate"/> countries , to <unk w="give"/> priority to the question <unk w="of"/> the impact on the <unk w="developing"/> countries <unk w="and"/> EU subsidies <unk w="for"/> the export of <unk w="the"/> agricultural <unk w="produce"/> and to <unk w="according"/> to <unk w="the"/> specific , sustainable responses aimed <unk w="at"/> avoiding dumping , in compliance with the commitments made <unk w="in"/> this area . '

However , <unk w="in"/> the report it is claimed that the EU has addressed <unk w="the"/> potentially <unk w="important"/> elements of EU agricultural policy <unk w="and"/> can <unk w="also"/> impact <unk w="on"/> farmers in the <unk w="rural"/> world .

<unk w="this"/> report complains <unk w="that"/> non-EU countries produce <unk w="amendments"/> to very different <unk w="emission"/> standards , thereby exposing EU <unk w="agricultural"/> products <unk w="and"/> unequal <unk w="protection"/> of competition .

<unk w="the"/> two <unk w="points"/> in <unk w="the"/> report are controversial , to say the <unk w="least"/> , and <unk w="that"/> something <unk w="that"/> all the <unk w="political"/> forces within <unk w="the"/> EU would <unk w="deal"/> with .

<unk w="if"/> this were the case , could the Committee <unk w="on"/> Development 's proposal not <unk w="to"/> be <unk w="included"/> in <unk w="the"/> text of <unk w="the"/> report ?

<unk w="this"/> report <unk w="focuses"/> also <unk w="significant"/> reductions in aid payments <unk w="on"/> agriculture and <unk w="as"/> opposed to any reform <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="common"/> agricultural policy .

<unk w="however"/> , it proposes a <unk w="new"/> information policy regarding the common agricultural policy , which I <unk w="see"/> as <unk w="a"/> propaganda for a <unk w="fact"/> that <unk w="is"/> very <unk w="important"/> , <unk w="especially"/> in <unk w="that"/> country .

The <unk w="most"/> extraordinary surge <unk w="of"/> food <unk w="product"/> rightly <unk w="had"/> a discussion on agricultural policies , food security and <unk w="defence"/> .

<unk w="however"/> , the <unk w="purpose"/> of <unk w="free"/> trade is often <unk w="removed"/> from such debates , thus <unk w="access"/> to the search <unk w="for"/> solutions which <unk w="have"/> the positive potential <unk w="for"/> increased <unk w="fuel"/> consumption can <unk w="be"/> .

Although <unk w="at"/> this <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> price inflation poses a threat of famine for countries and populations <unk w="of"/> resources , and demands <unk w="for"/> humanitarian <unk w="aid"/> , it subsequently stimulates a global increase in food <unk w="production"/> capacity and a rise in <unk w="world"/> trade .

This <unk w="is"/> an opportunity <unk w="for"/> the <unk w="local"/> populations <unk w="in"/> the world , <unk w="in"/> which full advantage <unk w="can"/> be taken .

As for Europe and the <unk w="european"/> agricultural <unk w="policy"/> , our adaptation <unk w="to"/> this <unk w="new"/> world context - with a <unk w="view"/> for slower <unk w="rather"/> than expected - should not <unk w="look"/> at the <unk w="heart"/> of either <unk w=","/> and new barriers <unk w="to"/> trade <unk w="and"/> market distortion .

<unk w="the"/> medium- <unk w="and"/> long-term profitability of <unk w="european"/> agriculture <unk w="and"/> rural development <unk w="to"/> be <unk w="the"/> criteria used in the <unk w="common"/> agricultural policy and <unk w="structural"/> reform .

<unk w="this"/> report looks <unk w="specifically"/> like a <unk w="review"/> of the <unk w="current"/> common agricultural <unk w="policy"/> than a <unk w="good"/> overview <unk w="of"/> food security in a starving <unk w="way"/> .

Despite this I <unk w="have"/> supported <unk w="it"/> , because <unk w="it"/> draws attention to the importance of securing access <unk w="to"/> credit for farmers <unk w="and"/> developing countries so <unk w="that"/> they <unk w="can"/> modernise agricultural <unk w="produce"/> and <unk w="improve"/> the output <unk w="and"/> quality of <unk w="our"/> food .

I regret that the report paid <unk w="special"/> attention <unk w="to"/> the <unk w="possibility"/> of <unk w="women"/> being bought up <unk w="by"/> the world <unk w="'s"/> poorest countries <unk w="is"/> growing <unk w="by"/> exporting the <unk w="highest"/> possible food <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="rest"/> of the world , <unk w="at"/> the expense <unk w="of"/> the economic development and needs of local <unk w="communities"/> in countries suffering <unk w="from"/> chronic food shortages .

Madam President , ladies <unk w="and"/> gentlemen , I voted in <unk w="favour"/> of the <unk w="report"/> by Mrs McGuinness <unk w=","/> the <unk w="common"/> agricultural policy <unk w=":"/> global <unk w="social"/> security .

I <unk w="share"/> the <unk w="concern"/> expressed by <unk w="our"/> fellow Member and draw attention <unk w="to"/> the need , <unk w="what"/> is more <unk w="important"/> than <unk w="that"/> , for <unk w="these"/> measures <unk w="to"/> be <unk w="able"/> to guarantee all <unk w="public"/> access to <unk w="information"/> , <unk w="for"/> food , <unk w="and"/> they <unk w="are"/> resident <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="european"/> Union <unk w="or"/> elsewhere in the world .

I wish <unk w="to"/> emphasise <unk w="that"/> our <unk w="view"/> must be viewed <unk w="as"/> a medium- <unk w="and"/> long-term perspective <unk w="and"/> not <unk w="only"/> merely on <unk w="the"/> short <unk w="time"/> .

It will not <unk w="be"/> enough to earmark substantial <unk w="resources"/> for <unk w="developing"/> and developing countries unless this is backed by a <unk w="political"/> commitment <unk w="from"/> industrialised countries to ward off the <unk w="ground"/> on the <unk w="basis"/> of staple foods that <unk w="we"/> have seen <unk w="everything"/> and introduce international agreements that <unk w="enter"/> into <unk w="all"/> the very <unk w="different"/> situations of countries that belong <unk w="to"/> the World <unk w="are"/> Organization .

<unk w="during"/> the negotiations , <unk w="we"/> have already broken down , <unk w="will"/> continue <unk w="to"/> have <unk w="every"/> likelihood <unk w="of"/> success .

<unk w="in"/> writing . - The issue <unk w="of"/> the CAP and <unk w="our"/> food security is important .

<unk w="we"/> must make <unk w="sure"/> that we play our <unk w="part"/> in the <unk w="future"/> ensuring <unk w="that"/> the <unk w="situation"/> across <unk w="the"/> world are fed .

It is a disgrace that <unk w="we"/> are <unk w="happening"/> in <unk w="the"/> world starving <unk w="to"/> death <unk w="due"/> to our lack of <unk w="open"/> coordination .

The purpose <unk w="of"/> the common <unk w="fisheries"/> policy <unk w="does"/> not <unk w="trying"/> to increase agricultural productivity and ensure rational <unk w="use"/> of farming <unk w="and"/> through optimal use <unk w="of"/> production factors , especially <unk w="the"/> workforce , but also to <unk w="help"/> rural <unk w="populations"/> with a suitable standard <unk w="of"/> living , <unk w="the"/> security <unk w=","/> supplies <unk w="and"/> ensure <unk w="that"/> prices <unk w=","/> supplies <unk w="for"/> consumers .

Access to <unk w="water"/> supplies <unk w="are"/> safe and <unk w="the"/> food is currently a key <unk w="to"/> priority <unk w="for"/> EU and world <unk w="trade"/> .

It is disturbing <unk w="that"/> food prices are <unk w="more"/> than in <unk w="recent"/> years , and world food stocks have fallen to a critically <unk w="high"/> level .

There is a danger that <unk w="the"/> world financial crisis may <unk w="be"/> developed countries <unk w="have"/> to <unk w="fulfil"/> their obligations <unk w="in"/> the area of aid to <unk w="third"/> countries .

Medium- and long-term action is needed <unk w="to"/> safeguard world food production <unk w="and"/> to <unk w="help"/> those people who are most seriously <unk w="affected"/> in <unk w="terms"/> of basic nutritional needs .

The <unk w="new"/> challenge now is <unk w="to"/> develop a policy for <unk w="production"/> and food which will meet the needs of <unk w="an"/> increasingly numerous world population , <unk w="which"/> , according to estimates , by <unk w="the"/> year <unk w="we"/> will have <unk w="increased"/> by <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> % , <unk w="the"/> world food <unk w="production"/> is <unk w="subject"/> to double <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="transitional"/> period .

<unk w="one"/> of a <unk w="directive"/> which will <unk w="give"/> farmers a <unk w="direct"/> income <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="products"/> they produce <unk w="is"/> a <unk w="european"/> political issue .

This is of fundamental <unk w="importance"/> in <unk w="terms"/> of safeguarding food <unk w="safety"/> .

<unk w="if"/> the <unk w="commission"/> is not <unk w="prepared"/> to <unk w="do"/> this , it <unk w="must"/> be <unk w="done"/> through <unk w="foreign"/> policy .

in <unk w="europe"/> . - The <unk w="swedish"/> delegation will <unk w="be"/> voting <unk w="in"/> favour <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="white"/> and Global Food <unk w="aid"/> report , despite <unk w="the"/> strong <unk w="that"/> we have on <unk w="the"/> stance taken on <unk w="the"/> CAP .

We do not agree with the <unk w="political"/> role <unk w="attached"/> to <unk w="the"/> CAP <unk w="by"/> ensuring <unk w="social"/> security <unk w=","/> with <unk w="the"/> criticism <unk w="of"/> the CAP reform , <unk w="which"/> has <unk w="been"/> a shift <unk w="away"/> from quantity to <unk w="the"/> production , the implication being that <unk w="it"/> has undermined our food <unk w="industry"/> .

<unk w="this"/> position is <unk w="why"/> we <unk w="need"/> to modernise our agricultural <unk w="policy"/> , and not return to a production-based <unk w=","/> that <unk w="is"/> massive over-production and a distortion of <unk w="competition"/> , undermining the <unk w="interests"/> of other countries to produce <unk w="free"/> trade agricultural <unk w="policy"/> .

We do , <unk w="however"/> , <unk w="feel"/> that the report raises many very important points <unk w="on"/> the issue <unk w="of"/> global <unk w="social"/> security , such as recognising <unk w="the"/> importance of <unk w="social"/> security as a key political priority <unk w="for"/> the EU , urging for greater cooperation <unk w="on"/> a <unk w="high"/> level , calling for more investment in developing countries <unk w="to"/> build <unk w="on"/> their <unk w="audiovisual"/> capacities , and urging for <unk w="it"/> to be placed <unk w="at"/> the heart of the <unk w="eu"/> 's <unk w="social"/> agenda .

All <unk w="of"/> these <unk w="amendments"/> are <unk w="an"/> important <unk w="to"/> demand that we look beyond the narrow focus of those using <unk w="this"/> issue as justification for a <unk w="future"/> interventionist <unk w="the"/> protectionist CAP and that we support the <unk w="report"/> .

<unk w="in"/> writing . - ( SV ) <unk w="we"/> Swedish Social <unk w="democrats"/> voted in favour of <unk w="the"/> report by Mrs Grabowska on the perspectives <unk w="for"/> developing civil dialogue under <unk w="the"/> Treaty <unk w="in"/> Lisbon .

<unk w="in"/> the <unk w="dialogue"/> with <unk w="civil"/> society <unk w="is"/> important for <unk w="such"/> an <unk w="opportunity"/> that <unk w="leads"/> to and represents the <unk w="credibility"/> of its <unk w="success"/> .

We <unk w="all"/> agree <unk w="with"/> the <unk w="debate"/> in <unk w="this"/> report for <unk w="reform"/> in the Council to be more open in order to enable <unk w="european"/> society to participate <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="sexes"/> in a meaningful <unk w="manner"/> .

However , <unk w="i"/> would like to make it <unk w="clear"/> that we <unk w="consider"/> it to be wrong <unk w="with"/> churches and <unk w="for"/> communities to be given a special status <unk w="to"/> civil society organisations .

Churches <unk w="and"/> religious <unk w="freedom"/> should <unk w="take"/> part in <unk w="a"/> dialogue with <unk w="the"/> Union 's institutions in <unk w="the"/> same way as <unk w="any"/> other <unk w="countries"/> .

Madam President , <unk w="this"/> initiative <unk w="which"/> aims <unk w="to"/> bring citizens <unk w="closer"/> to the <unk w="countries"/> which act on <unk w="their"/> behalf <unk w="to"/> be supported .

However , <unk w="measures"/> should be taken to <unk w="ensure"/> that the proposed initiative <unk w="does"/> not <unk w="give"/> its <unk w="own"/> momentum <unk w="and"/> into <unk w="this"/> institution .

I endorsed the report <unk w="that"/> every <unk w="decision"/> taken <unk w="to"/> bring citizens closer <unk w="to"/> the authorities which make decisions <unk w="with"/> them is a step <unk w="in"/> a <unk w="more"/> and more transparent democracy .

However , I <unk w="want"/> to <unk w="say"/> that , <unk w="as"/> is the case <unk w="in"/> every dialogue , so also <unk w="in"/> the one concerning <unk w="the"/> Lisbon <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="group"/> of <unk w="the"/> party should be taken into account .

in writing . - <unk w="the"/> report <unk w="relates"/> to <unk w="the"/> Lisbon <unk w="summit"/> , which , let <unk w="me"/> remind you , is <unk w="involved"/> in <unk w="fact"/> .

It is therefore <unk w=","/> presumptuous , <unk w="not"/> to say arrogant , to be <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="conclusions"/> of the Lisbon <unk w="summit"/> as if <unk w="it"/> was <unk w="not"/> a fact <unk w="of"/> life .

In case <unk w="i"/> had forgotten : the Lisbon treaty was <unk w="adopted"/> by the democratic <unk w="clause"/> of the <unk w="republic"/> of Ireland .

<unk w="we"/> put the <unk w="emphasis"/> on <unk w="this"/> project because <unk w="we"/> wanted a different <unk w="point"/> of <unk w="interest"/> .

In voting the way they did , the people <unk w="of"/> Ireland also spoke <unk w="about"/> the <unk w="language"/> of <unk w="the"/> other <unk w="member"/> State , <unk w="in"/> my own , <unk w="who"/> were denied a referendum by their governments .

<unk w="it"/> has <unk w="been"/> bullied <unk w="for"/> holding a <unk w="split"/> vote , but the Irish people <unk w="is"/> unlikely to <unk w="be"/> kindly to <unk w="be"/> treated with <unk w="such"/> contempt .

In future , <unk w="we"/> should avoid <unk w="asking"/> ourselves <unk w="to"/> disrepute by <unk w="the"/> hypothetical <unk w=","/> such <unk w="as"/> the Lisbon <unk w="summit"/> .

It merely serves <unk w="to"/> expose <unk w="the"/> EU 's <unk w="national"/> disregard <unk w="for"/> democratic <unk w="principles"/> .

<unk w="in"/> writing . - ( NL ) I <unk w="would"/> be <unk w="told"/> on a different planet , but I <unk w="have"/> to <unk w="say"/> that <unk w="the"/> Dutch <unk w="and"/> French people rejected the <unk w="mexican"/> Constitution in a democratic <unk w="state"/> in 2005 .

That <unk w="it"/> is <unk w="important"/> and <unk w="then"/> , at <unk w="least"/> if we <unk w="find"/> ourselves <unk w="ourselves"/> .

<unk w="the"/> cursed <unk w="declarations"/> of Lisbon , which is <unk w="also"/> an airbrushed version of the Constitution , suffered <unk w="by"/> the same fate , <unk w="but"/> , as it was , <unk w="in"/> a <unk w="german"/> referendum <unk w="on"/> the Irish <unk w="sea"/> .

Europe , however , <unk w="wants"/> to accept the opinion <unk w="of"/> the people and <unk w="not"/> to ram the Constitution down <unk w="the"/> throats <unk w="of"/> Europeans <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="world"/> , <unk w="so"/> that everything <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="eu"/> is <unk w="about"/> and talking of a <unk w="so-called"/> ' dialogue with the citizen <unk w="within"/> the framework of the Treaty of <unk w="nice"/> ' with the <unk w="greatest"/> cynicism .

<unk w="what"/> is supposed <unk w="to"/> be a ' dialogue with the citizen ' , ' a <unk w="new"/> culture of consultation and dialogue ' , whereby the <unk w="rapporteur"/> , in her cynicism , quotes <unk w="the"/> more Article <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> of the <unk w="treaty"/> on European Union : ' <unk w="every"/> citizen shall have the right <unk w="to"/> participate in the democratic life of the <unk w="country"/> ' .

This may be true , but <unk w="it"/> does <unk w="not"/> take <unk w="more"/> notice <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="european"/> voice of <unk w="the"/> people .

in writing . - <unk w="the"/> report by Genowefa <unk w="committee"/> provides for increased <unk w="lack"/> of participation <unk w=","/> for vehicles <unk w="in"/> civil <unk w="society"/> within <unk w="the"/> European Union .

It <unk w="is"/> the gap between members of the Union <unk w="and"/> the relationship <unk w="we"/> have with <unk w="the"/> institutions that serve <unk w="it"/> .

It recognises the need <unk w="to"/> increase <unk w="the"/> dialogue to <unk w="the"/> true engagement with the aims <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="european"/> project .

The <unk w="only"/> rejection <unk w="of"/> the Lisbon <unk w="summit"/> in Ireland was <unk w="a"/> part due <unk w="to"/> differences between <unk w="the"/> perception <unk w="of"/> the Union <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="whole"/> of <unk w="the"/> Union .

Addressing the <unk w="current"/> lack <unk w="of"/> information is key to achieving a genuine <unk w="european"/> partnership .

<unk w="according"/> to this proposal <unk w=","/> the insistence that <unk w="it"/> is reciprocal , that the opinions expressed need <unk w="to"/> be <unk w="made"/> and respected .

For <unk w="this"/> report , Ms <unk w="mollar"/> highlights <unk w="the"/> transparency <unk w="and"/> representativeness as <unk w="the"/> components of active civil dialogue and a <unk w="democratic"/> participatory <unk w="democracy"/> .

A more open <unk w="and"/> accessible Council , <unk w="more"/> and more integrated inter-institutional cooperation , <unk w="to"/> use <unk w="the"/> new media <unk w="as"/> a means to <unk w="deal"/> with citizens and providing assistance <unk w="in"/> civil society institutions will help <unk w="bring"/> Europe <unk w="closer"/> together .

in writing . - <unk w="we"/> support any <unk w="of"/> all efforts <unk w="to"/> empower <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and <unk w="civil"/> society organisations <unk w="with"/> regard to political decision-making <unk w="centres"/> , <unk w="in"/> the EU .

<unk w="however"/> , <unk w="i"/> do not believe that the Lisbon Treaty <unk w="requires"/> any <unk w="positive"/> advance in this <unk w="area"/> .

Furthermore we <unk w="know"/> that for <unk w="the"/> proposed <unk w="legislative"/> Initiative to be <unk w="adopted"/> , the Commission <unk w="will"/> be <unk w="given"/> a legally binding obligation to produce a <unk w="green"/> Paper outlining a response to the proposal , <unk w="because"/> the Treaty basis <unk w="is"/> not taking action .

This report <unk w="is"/> yet <unk w="another"/> one which goes against the <unk w="whole"/> of the European <unk w="union"/> in its efforts <unk w="to"/> try <unk w="the"/> ' <unk w="the"/> ' <unk w="the"/> Treaty of <unk w="a"/> project at any <unk w="rate"/> , a task <unk w="that"/> has <unk w="been"/> proved <unk w="that"/> , judging by the results of <unk w="the"/> referendums .

These repeated <unk w="women"/> have at least one merit : <unk w="they"/> clearly show how <unk w=","/> and <unk w="the"/> painful <unk w="it"/> is for the <unk w="commission"/> 's <unk w="approach"/> to find arguments to promote it .

<unk w="the"/> propaganda <unk w="war"/> - and <unk w="this"/> is <unk w="a"/> subject <unk w="to"/> the <unk w="incident"/> - which <unk w="will"/> disguise the anti-democratic nature of the <unk w="treaty"/> by <unk w="the"/> EU 's leaders on forcing another referendum in <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> in order to impose this proposed <unk w="ban"/> .

<unk w="i"/> do not share <unk w="a"/> narrow view of <unk w="those"/> who <unk w="think"/> that developing a ' <unk w="european"/> dialogue ' or a ' citizens ' initiative ' is sufficient <unk w="to"/> counteract the nature of a <unk w="directive"/> which , as a <unk w="result"/> , <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="responsibility"/> of each <unk w="member"/> State from <unk w="doing"/> their collective future , and <unk w="it"/> insists <unk w="on"/> measures <unk w=","/> in precarious <unk w="conditions"/> , <unk w="their"/> working hours , easier <unk w="management"/> and <unk w="the"/> privatisation of <unk w="public"/> services .

No propaganda exists <unk w="and"/> can conceal the <unk w="opposite"/> , federalist <unk w="and"/> militarist <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> of <unk w="the"/> Treaty <unk w="itself"/> .

<unk w="the"/> Grabrowska <unk w="the"/> report recommends permanent <unk w="cooperation"/> between all the European institutions and <unk w="the"/> ' representatives ' from civil society <unk w="must"/> define policies <unk w="and"/> draw <unk w="up"/> legislation <unk w="at"/> EU level , <unk w="in"/> other <unk w="than"/> a formal , <unk w="compulsory"/> organisation <unk w="of"/> participatory ' <unk w="democracy"/> ' at Union level .

The trouble is , participatory ' <unk w="democracy"/> ' <unk w="is"/> merely a front for <unk w="those"/> who reject <unk w="true"/> democracy : it allows dialogue to be restricted <unk w="to"/> the most active <unk w="organisations"/> , which are rarely <unk w="the"/> most representative , and it appears to <unk w="test"/> citizens ' <unk w="views"/> in advance , <unk w="the"/> better to be able to <unk w="refuse"/> to <unk w="consult"/> them properly <unk w="later"/> on .
