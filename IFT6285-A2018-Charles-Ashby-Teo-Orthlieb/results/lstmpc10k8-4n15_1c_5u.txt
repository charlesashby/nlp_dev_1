It is important for me to take advantage of the 10th anniversary of this key event <unk w=":"/> European integration to pay homage , in my turn , to those men who created the euro , such as Pierre Werner , Helmut Kohl , François Mitterrand , Jacques Delors , Valéry Giscard d 'Estaing and others .

I would like , once again , <unk w="to"/> applaud their vision , their determination and their unfailing commitment to Europe .

Since 1 January of this year , 16 Member States have been participating in the Economic and Monetary Union and the euro is the currency of almost <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> million European citizens .

The euro , then , has become the most tangible <unk w="factor"/> <unk w="for"/> European integration .

After 10 years , it has <unk w="to"/> be recognised that the euro is an unquestionable success .

Now , anniversaries only have value if they are bridges to the future , as <unk w="we"/> have to recognise that , despite our collective indulgence <unk w=","/> we congratulate ourselves , the true tests for the cohesiveness and coherence of the euro area await us .

Internally , euro area governments will have to act together to contain the effects of the economic crisis and invest in the structural bases of <unk w="the"/> economy to build a bridge to the post-crisis world .

The euro area economies are better protected against negative economic developments because being part of the euro area is a mark of quality certifying that <unk w="the"/> members <unk w="have"/> a real capacity for implementing prudent macroeconomic policies and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="impact"/> on sustained growth and prosperity for its citizens .

This <unk w="report"/> is the foundation of the benefits of Economic and Monetary Union and we must maintain it to continue fully to profit from the benefits of the single currency .

Externally , we have to <unk w="take"/> the political lessons from the international financial and economic crisis .

There is a direct causal link between the current crisis , with its origins in the United States , and the <unk w="third"/> <unk w="of"/> major world imbalances .

The lack of sufficient transparency , responsibility and integrity in the financial <unk w="markets"/> therefore acted as a catalyst <unk w="for"/> the crisis .

The re-establishment of stability in the financial <unk w="sector"/> the real economy on a world scale <unk w=","/> a <unk w="major"/> reform of the financial system and the elimination of the <unk w="traditional"/> imbalances in the mix of global consumption and global saving .

Despite <unk w="this"/> progress , <unk w="the"/> euro 's international image remains , too often , overly fragmented and national interests too often <unk w="carried"/> out over the common interest , preventing the euro area from fully assuming the political responsibility that corresponds to its economic importance and from achieving all of the economic benefits deriving from Economic and Monetary Union .

Economic and Monetary Union is , <unk w="of"/> course , an economic project , but it is , first of all , a political project .

Mr President , Prime <unk w="minister"/> , Chairmen of the committees , ladies and gentlemen , I am sure that I am echoing the views of the vast majority of this Chamber in saying that , 10 years after its launch , I , as a European , <unk w="terribly"/> proud of the success of the euro .

I would like to congratulate Parliament on its initiative to commemorate the 10th <unk w="accession"/> of our single currency here , in this Plenary <unk w="session"/> of the European Parliament in Strasbourg .

The euro and Economic and Monetary Union <unk w="has"/> undeniably been a success .

Over these 10 years , the euro has brought many benefits to all its members and continues to do so today amid a deep economic and <unk w="political"/> crisis .

Above all , <unk w="however"/> , the euro is part of the daily life of nearly 330 million people in 16 countries of the European Union .

We all carry in our wallets this symbol of a shared European identity : because the euro , <unk w="as"/> well as being a currency , is a central element of <unk w="the"/> European project , reminding us in a tangible way of the benefits of the integration process that began over half a century ago .

The euro has provided a clear boost to trade <unk w="and"/> investment among its Member States .

The euro has encouraged financial integration and the development of the single market ; it has protected the members of the euro area from <unk w="community"/> disruption ; and it has been and continues to be a pole of stability , not just for the European economy , but also for the global economy .

The crisis is , without a doubt , a <unk w="need"/> for the euro .

However , those who think that the Economic and Monetary Union is not ready to <unk w="consider"/> the consequences <unk w="of"/> this crisis are quite mistaken .

On the contrary , <unk w="if"/> the single currency did not exist , the adverse effects of the crisis would be much greater .

Many Member States would <unk w="be"/> <unk w="be"/> facing great volatility in their exchange rates and , possibly , might even be suffering speculative <unk w="people"/> on their currencies .

The Stability and Growth Pact , <unk w="back"/> in 2005 , has encouraged governments to sort <unk w="out"/> their public accounts , leading in 2007 to <unk w="the"/> lowest budget deficit for 25 years , which is now enabling them to face the crisis in a better situation .

Throughout this crisis , the actions of the European Central Bank <unk w="has"/> done nothing but <unk w="has"/> the solid reputation that it had already earned in the early years of <unk w="economic"/> and Monetary Union .

For those countries which have not yet joined , the euro area is an increasingly attractive option , as demonstrated last <unk w="year"/> in Bratislava when we welcomed Slovakia as the newest - the 16th - member of the euro family .

The European Commission and Parliament must continue working <unk w="with"/> Member States , the Eurogroup , the European Central Bank and the international community in order to place our economies on the path to the sustainable resumption of growth .

In this regard , the Commission 's recommendations in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="report"/> that we submitted a few months ago on the first <unk w="four"/> years of Economic and Monetary Union , which was recently debated in this Chamber , <unk w="just"/> as valid or even more valid today than <unk w="they"/> were last spring .

Increased budgetary vigilance , its extension to other macroeconomic aspects , the link between <unk w="community"/> policies and structural reform , the external image <unk w="of"/> the euro <unk w=","/> improved governance of the Economic and Monetary Union are , and must continue to be , the core <unk w="issue"/> on which to base the euro 's second decade , with at least as many successes as this first one .

Mr President , I would like to conclude by paying tribute to the vision and ambition of the founding <unk w="fathers"/> of the euro , whose imagination and resolute action bequeathed to us a currency <unk w=","/> <unk w="that"/> all Europeans can be proud .

The <unk w="commission"/> has opened up a <unk w="new"/> chapter for the global economy , in which the Economic and Monetary Union must continue to play a relevant role in <unk w="strengthening"/> the common interests and ambitions of all Europeans .

Mr President , Mr Juncker , Mr Trichet , ladies and gentlemen , everyone who has been involved in creating the European currency is grateful to you , Mr President , and to you , ladies and gentlemen , for this very fine initiative which you have taken in <unk w="conjunction"/> the 10th anniversary of the birth of the euro .

I am one of those people who think that it is better to avoid the ever-increasing number <unk w="of"/> commemoration ceremonies , but this one is justified because it marks the greatest contribution to European integration since the election of the European Parliament by universal suffrage in 1979 .

We have certainly come a long way and perhaps this pleasant , <unk w="but"/> gathering <unk w="does"/> not paint the whole picture .

I would like to pay <unk w="tribute"/> to all those who <unk w="carry"/> out this course and those who have followed it .

We can find its distant origins in the report from <unk w="the"/> Luxembourg prime minister , Pierre Werner , your predecessor , in 1970 .

It was , however , the monetary crisis in the years <unk w=","/> followed and the currency flotation which triggered action in <unk w="this"/> area .

As long as the currency exchange rates were fixed , the monetary system did not upset our attempt <unk w="to"/> create a common market .

After the unsuccessful attempts to create a <unk w="new"/> <unk w="solution"/> , the strong momentum from France <unk w="and"/> Germany between 1975 and 1980 led to the meeting in Bremen , in northern Germany , and the decision to create the European Monetary System and introduce the ecu , the euro 's precursor .

This <unk w="parliament"/> had the backing and support of our partners in the Benelux countries <unk w="and"/> Italy .

After a period of little activity between 1980 and 1988 , the process was given new impetus with the creation by the Council of the <unk w="commission"/> chaired <unk w="by"/> Jacques Delors , resulting in the signature of the <unk w="maastricht"/> Treaty .

Let us salute the pioneers who have been involved in <unk w="them"/> along the way , as you yourself have recently , Mr President , as well as my friend , Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and his Secretary of State , Manfred Lahnstein ; Bernard Clappier , the governor of the Banque de France at the time and co-author of Robert Schuman 's Declaration in 1950 ; Alexandre Lamfalussy , who provided us with his great , almost unique expertise during the work of the committee on European monetary union which we set up with Helmut Schmidt to relaunch the project ; Jacques Delors , President of the European Commission , who took over ; and , last but not least , the negotiators and signatories of the Maastricht Treaty who drafted an excellent text , which has not actually been touched since then , headed <unk w="by"/> Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President François Mitterrand , whose determination must be mentioned in particular , along with their other colleagues .

On this occasion of the 10th anniversary , being celebrated at a <unk w="very"/> <unk w="of"/> crisis , what can we say in support of the euro ?

What fine words <unk w="will"/> we use in our anniversary toasts ?

During the conversations which I had with <unk w="the"/> most eminent monetary experts between 1995 and 2000 , they were all sceptical <unk w="about"/> the <unk w="process"/> of introducing the euro and making it a success .

In 10 years the euro has become the number two currency in the world <unk w="and"/> , as has been mentioned just now , one of the most respected currencies .

<unk w="this"/> sound management has provided a protective shield against the crisis and a platform for <unk w="economic"/> growth .

Without the existence of the euro , mainland Europe <unk w="can"/> be currently turned upside down by a monetary tornado , which would deepen the economic crisis .

We are expecting the <unk w="european"/> policy to try to contain , within the <unk w="framework"/> of the currency 's power , the depressing impact of the <unk w="environment"/> and to pave the way for the return to non-inflationary <unk w="balkans"/> , which we are not tackling <unk w="here"/> , by which time <unk w=","/> sizeable <unk w=","/> deficits and <unk w="lack"/> of debt triggered by the crisis ought to have <unk w="been"/> cleared .

In this respect , we are putting our trust in the managers and staff at the European Central Bank , who have demonstrated their considerable <unk w="role"/> since the start of the crisis .

We must be careful not to try to give the euro a global dimension , which would flatter our vanity , <unk w="which"/> would multiply the risks we face .

The euro is Europe 's currency and must express its <unk w="own"/> culture , promoting a rational and stable model among the world 's other currencies .

<unk w="however"/> , I do <unk w="not"/> think that the general public will need to wait too long <unk w="for"/> banking regulation to be restored in the euro area .

It seems to <unk w="me"/> that <unk w="we"/> could <unk w="happen"/> on the European Central <unk w="bank"/> to carry out this process of restoring order and supervise its implementation , <unk w="pursuant"/> to Article 106 ( 5 ) of the Maastricht Treaty .

Indeed , we need a strong impetus , expertise and a decision timetable which the European Central Bank could draw up and which the Council of Ministers for the euro area , presided by your good self , Mr Juncker , could then adopt and <unk w="support"/> .

I will conclude , Mr President , by saying <unk w="that"/> the <unk w="process"/> of integration represented by the euro 's success must give us the courage to take the next step in creating <unk w="an"/> increasingly united Europe as recommended under the various treaties and which we are endeavouring to achieve .

Let us <unk w="remind"/> the inevitability of failure with the energy of success .

That success today goes <unk w="through"/> the lovely name of the euro .

Mr President , the euro is the successful outcome <unk w="of"/> a vision and political will , and not the product of the market .

<unk w="this"/> demonstrates <unk w="the"/> best <unk w="that"/> Europe can achieve when everyone joins forces .

I also want , of course , on this occasion to salute and thank on our behalf , on our children 's behalf and on everyone <unk w="else"/> 's behalf , the founding fathers and the architects of this success : Pierre Werner , who is <unk w="before"/> us , Chancellor Helmut Schmidt , President Giscard d 'Estaing , the President of the European Commission Jacques Delors , Chancellor Helmut Kohl , President François Mitterrand , Baron Alexandre Lamfalussy , Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa , Philippe Maystadt and everyone else whom I have not mentioned .

I would also , however , like to pay tribute to the actions of your predecessors , Mr <unk w="president"/> , the actions of my predecessors , Karl von Wogau , <unk w="who"/> is still with us , and of Christa Randzio-Plath , who is also with us today .

I also <unk w="believe"/> that this action by our institution must be recalled and given credit .

It is <unk w="also"/> the concern of Europeans , <unk w="and"/> they are happy to tell us .

However , Europeans themselves have adopted the euro as a symbol of belonging to the <unk w="european"/> Union .

I think that this is the <unk w="best"/> proof of our success .

<unk w="it"/> makes progress , as is so <unk w="often"/> the case , by demonstrating its efficiency and on this occasion to mark its 10th anniversary , we can clearly see that the assessment of the euro is largely a positive one .

Some countries which were hesitant could now knock on the door of the <unk w="free-trade"/> area .

We can only encourage <unk w="them"/> to do this under the terms of the Treaty , which have never been revised and which are useful terms allowing Europe to progress in economic and monetary matters on the basis of the two pillars of consolidation and enlargement .

The euro , which has been enriched by these last 10 years , must now open up new areas for development , not that we have not dealt with these at all , but simply because they <unk w="can"/> still work in progress ahead of us .

In this <unk w="respect"/> <unk w=","/> we all know that , if we had made progress in the Economic Union as quickly as <unk w="we"/> have in the Monetary Union , we would be even better off today .

<unk w="it"/> is not normal for us to focus on the budget deficit balances and not on the quality of public spending .

It is not normal for Member States to borrow at such different rates of interest when they have the same currency and the same rate of interest set by the <unk w="european"/> Central Bank .

I think that one of the lessons from this crisis is that <unk w="the"/> <unk w="also"/> shows that the European Central Bank will need to <unk w="play"/> a supervisory role .

We do <unk w="not"/> want to disconnect the supervision of <unk w="the"/> financial markets from macroprudential supervision .

However , to achieve <unk w="this"/> , we will also need , as political leaders , to think about achieving a balance .

I agree that we must not demand the exorbitant privilege of being the <unk w="european"/> currency .

<unk w="however"/> , it is not normal either for us to have taken 10 years to create the euro and then , 10 years after the transition to the euro , we are still passive in the international arena and the strong voice of the euro is not being heard more clearly in the process of restoring some balance to the global monetary system .

Finally , I believe that the euro is much more than just a <unk w="result"/> .

Mr President , 10 years of the <unk w="treaty"/> is indeed a reason to celebrate .

Anyone who had said 10 years ago that the euro would have developed as splendidly as it <unk w="has"/> done would have been laughed at .

Many people have contributed to this success , and I remember many sceptical <unk w="things"/> - it was referred to as a premature baby and an unviable project - and today we know that it was a vision to which many people contributed .

The previous speaker reminded us of <unk w="all"/> those who contributed to this , of <unk w="the"/> milestones , of the <unk w="european"/> monetary system , which was an agreement with the European Central Bank to create central rates , of the <unk w="synthesis"/> report , which provided for the introduction of the monetary union in three stages , <unk w="and"/> the Treaty <unk w="of"/> Maastricht - only two years after the fall of <unk w="the"/> Wall - and of the transitional periods .

<unk w="these"/> people have helped to make <unk w="the"/> euro the successful project it is <unk w="possible"/> .

As the committee chairman , Mrs Berès , has already said , during this period , in particular from 1994 when the implementation of the Treaty of Maastricht began , and up to 2002 , Parliament actively cooperated in the introduction <unk w="of"/> the notes and coins , and in many reports , discussions , opinions and also proposals , and I would like specifically to <unk w="congratulate"/> the two committee <unk w=","/> from that time , Mr von Wogau and Mrs Randzio-Plath , who also represented Parliament to the outside world and who gave this project , although <unk w="was"/> created by the governments , the parliamentary support <unk w="is"/> needed .

On 18 November Parliament adopted , with a large majority , a report in which we describe the successes , challenges , risks and <unk w="speed"/> , and I would like to mention just a few things in addition to what Mrs Berès has said .

The euro has been a great success , and it is a unique project : a <unk w="new"/> <unk w="of"/> policy under the management of the European Central Bank and local budgetary and finance policies .

It is <unk w="clear"/> that , in future , the connection between these two levels of responsibility in the Stability and Growth Pact are retained also during times of <unk w="time"/> .

Without this <unk w="stability"/> and <unk w="stability"/> Pact , without stronger coordination of the budgetary and finance policy , the euro would also in <unk w="fact"/> face risks that are avoidable .

In this regard , I appeal in particular to the Member States <unk w="of"/> the euro area , but also to the whole of the European Union , to take this discipline , this <unk w="is"/> cooperation , more <unk w="so"/> than has been <unk w="the"/> case in the past in connection with <unk w="these"/> issues .

The euro has pushed down inflation considerably and so created confidence and <unk w="clearly"/> , and it has become the second most commonly held reserve currency in a space of time that no one thought it capable of .

<unk w="the"/> <unk w="this"/> has increased the pressure for structural reform in the Member States and therefore , even in the <unk w="process"/> of globalisation , <unk w="has"/> become a ' fitness programme ' for undertakings and for nations .

The institutions <unk w="of"/> the euro area - several were mentioned by the previous speaker - the Ecofin Council , the Euro Group <unk w="and"/> many other <unk w="things"/> have <unk w="created"/> the necessary conditions together with the Commission and the European Central Bank , because they were already operating , because they were in place , because they <unk w="decide"/> independently in order to <unk w="intervene"/> quickly , reliably and correctly in the economic crisis .

We have experienced <unk w="the"/> euro as a lever <unk w="for"/> creating a European financial market .

There are numerous specific <unk w="questions"/> and demands to take the risks seriously : the drifting apart of the national economies , which is associated with considerable <unk w="concern"/> in connection with the growth of wages and with budget deficits , should not be concealed on this anniversary .

An entirely different aspect is the <unk w="balanced"/> development of the interest rates for government bonds .

We are currently <unk w="in"/> the interest rate margin , which has no doubt decreased , increasing again , bringing the possibility of new problems in this regard for individual Member States within the euro area .

I would remind the House that , particularly in connection with the expansion of the euro area , no special <unk w="priority"/> may be given and that all states that are members of the euro area can , and must , <unk w="deal"/> with these conditions of the <unk w="treaty"/> of Maastricht .

It has passed the first test and has provided a unique contribution to the permanent <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of our nations in Europe .

<unk w="mr"/> President , Mr Giscard d 'Estaing , Mr Juncker , Mr Trichet , Mr Almunia , ladies and <unk w="gentlemen"/> , many good points have already been made .

<unk w="for"/> 10 years , the <unk w="country"/> has become a strong symbol for Europe .

<unk w="despite"/> the idea that Europe could create a single <unk w="market"/> , whose foundations were laid <unk w="down"/> in the Bremen agreement on the monetary system <unk w="in"/> 1978 and the creation of <unk w="a"/> ecu , would have been met at the time with scepticism from the markets and the main monetary authorities outside Europe .

We should warmly thank and <unk w="congratulate"/> all those who made the decision and whose names have been mentioned here .

The creation of the euro is the best proof that <unk w="it"/> is capable , given the political will , to take long-term decisions for a <unk w="democratic"/> , prosperous future .

Studies have , in fact , shown that in <unk w="some"/> countries inflation was <unk w="sometimes"/> even though the official figures showed that , due especially to the action of the European Central Bank , monetary stability had been ensured .

When the euro has risen against <unk w="the"/> dollar , we have also heard comments from some manufacturers who for the most part produce <unk w="in"/> the euro area but <unk w="also"/> outside this area .

The European Central Bank has not been without its <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , who <unk w="did"/> not <unk w="merely"/> <unk w="to"/> question its independence but rather its policy on interest rates , which seemed to be too high .

The welcome results of the euro must encourage us to continue and to broaden the coordination of economic policies and <unk w="to"/> respect the principles of the Stability and Growth Pact .

It is true , at present , that exceptions may and perhaps should be accepted , but they can only be temporary and <unk w="the"/> objective of balanced public finances must be retained .

High-quality public finances and economic policies are , in fact , in the <unk w="long"/> run , more than ever necessary .

Mr President , during these times of uncertainty , it is important <unk w="to"/> be able to count <unk w="on"/> something with a reliable value : the euro .

As I was able to play a bit-part as a member of the Ecofin Council during the period of preparation for the future single currency , I could see the doubts on both sides of the argument and the pussyfooting of the Member States , which ultimately made the Eurogroup into a stronger forum for cooperation ahead <unk w="of"/> its time .

I am referring to the Schengen Agreement entailing the free movement of Europeans , which was implemented on the <unk w="basis"/> of five states : France , with President Mitterrand , Germany , with Chancellor Kohl , along with the Benelux countries .

President Mitterrand and Chancellor <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> were also the political architects of the euro , even though there were many who supported this monetary <unk w="package"/> , starting with Jacques Delors .

The Prüm Treaty , which is intended to combat serious crime , is an example <unk w="of"/> this positive enhanced cooperation for Europe .

At a time when the Constitutional Treaty is dead and buried , following the ' <unk w="no"/> ' vote from a strange coalition of political forces not only in France but in the Netherlands too , and when the indigestible piece of legislation known as the ' mini ' <unk w="line"/> of Lisbon is being blocked <unk w="by"/> Ireland and possibly in the Czech Republic as <unk w="well"/> , we should prove that Europe is still functioning by relying on the huge area of enhanced cooperation .

In any case , the attraction <unk w="of"/> the euro remains intact .

Even in the UK voices are being raised , questioning the country 's splendid <unk w="involvement"/> in the face of the pound 's collapse , which has seen its status <unk w=","/> from that of the world 's <unk w="single"/> currency to a run-of-the-mill currency in less than a century .

Thanks to <unk w="the"/> consistent actions of Wim Duisenberg , Jean-Claude Trichet and the likes , the euro has become the <unk w="former"/> 's second reserve currency <unk w="of"/> 10 years .

Of course , the dollar remains king for global transactions , still <unk w="on"/> a safe investment , but the colossal debts accumulated by the United States in getting the <unk w="north"/> of the world to finance their lifestyle will increasingly <unk w="improve"/> the <unk w="interests"/> of doubt as to the ability of the number one economic power to honour its commitments .

In these times of widespread recession , the world <unk w="of"/> <unk w=","/> and new <unk w="technologies"/> .

As Jacques Delors said , the euro <unk w="is"/> the shield <unk w="to"/> protect the whole of Europe , <unk w="but"/> the euro has not <unk w="been"/> the European economy enough so far .

<unk w="at"/> the end of the day , the Commission is only a first-class consultant making suggestions which are generally useful , but the real economic players remain the states themselves which , unfortunately , are operating in a disorganised manner .

Although the effective <unk w="implementation"/> of the cumulative economic power of 27 states could work miracles , the Eurogroup , in spite of the <unk w="concerted"/> efforts of Jean-Claude Juncker , still only remains an informal discussion group .

<unk w="in"/> the spring of 1999 , I was <unk w="going"/> to witness the attempt <unk w="made"/> within the Eurogroup by a few finance ministers , including Oskar <unk w="parents"/> , Dominique Strauss-Kahn , Carlo Ciampi and a few others , to establish economic and monetary cooperation between the European Union and <unk w="the"/> European Central Bank .

The reason for this is <unk w="clear"/> : the ECB is and will remain independent in conducting its monetary policy , but independence does not mean a ban on constructive dialogue between institutions tasked <unk w="and"/> defending the interests and common destiny of 500 million Europeans .

There is <unk w="nothing"/> to prevent states from organising <unk w="a"/> better with regard to achieving proper coordination of their economic policies , whether it is inside the EU or especially when representing Europe externally , as Jean-Claude Juncker so <unk w="far"/> concluded just now .

Mr President , Mr Giscard d 'Estaing , Mr Juncker , Mr Trichet , Mr Almunia , <unk w="ladies"/> and gentlemen , I find it very regrettable that relatively few Members are here <unk w="today"/> <unk w="in"/> this formal sitting , because it really is a <unk w="political"/> event .

We have already <unk w="received"/> from the <unk w="three"/> previous speakers <unk w="so"/> much scepticism there was when the euro was first introduced .

It was felt that the logistical challenges involved in introducing <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> banknotes and coins alone would be unmanageable , and the idea that we could combine a common monetary <unk w="policy"/> with separate fiscal <unk w="measures"/> in the Member States was seen not just as a major challenge but as simply impossible .

This is <unk w="one"/> of a minor political miracle , and once again the words of <unk w="the"/> Hallstein , the first President of the Commission , have proven to <unk w="be"/> true : ' Anyone who does not believe in miracles in European matters is not a realist . '

The doubts of the citizens , many of whom , in many Member States , initially believed that the euro would result in huge price <unk w="prices"/> , have now disappeared .

It <unk w="has"/> become something of a visible European identifier : besides the anthem and the flag , it is one of the <unk w="greatest"/> symbols we have today .

It could , I think , be said that , in the European Central Bank 's first few years , Europe and the European economy <unk w="is"/> sailing in relatively <unk w="small"/> waters , so that the bank found it <unk w="not"/> easy to pursue a policy <unk w="of"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .

Even so , it is worth pointing out that the mean inflation rate over the first 10 years of the euro has <unk w="been"/> approximately 2 % , <unk w="in"/> other words <unk w=","/> or less on the target that the European Central <unk w="bank"/> set itself .

The German mark , on the other hand , which was always held up as a poster child for stability , had a mean inflation rate of 3 % over its 50 years <unk w="of"/> existence .

However , it is now , in this time of crisis , that the European Central Bank is showing <unk w="its"/> true strength , its true quality .

It has become an example for some central banks , both in those European <unk w="countries"/> that are not yet part of the euro area and outside Europe .

It has made it quite clear to the Federal Reserve in <unk w="the"/> United States that it can pursue a successful policy , not despite its independence but precisely because it is politically independent and not subject to instructions from various governments .

We now know that at the moment , after the banking sectors in the individual Member States have been brought under a protective umbrella , the Member States are in the <unk w="interest"/> of developing various economic stimulus plans to absorb the negative impact of the financial crisis on the real economy .

This will present the European Central Bank with further challenges , because <unk w="there"/> is a risk that the differences in approach will result in distortions of competition , and <unk w="in"/> the convergence we have , in part , now <unk w="and"/> between the members of the euro area will be lost and we will see increasingly <unk w="positive"/> developments .

This needs to be counteracted , which is why <unk w="it"/> is so crucial and so important that the Stability and Growth Pact must <unk w="henceforth"/> be undermined or discarded .

That is why it is also so important for the necessary structural reforms , which the Commission and the European Central <unk w="bank"/> have repeatedly called for in the past , actually to be pursued in the individual Member States .

The crisis has taught us <unk w="that"/> we need some kind of European supervision of the financial market , and this is an area where <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="central"/> Bank can play a major role .

It has signalled that it is , in principle , willing to introduce some kind of central European supervisory <unk w="authority"/> analogous to the European System of Central Banks .

The euro area needs to speak with one voice , and also be represented as a unit <unk w="of"/> international organisations such as the International <unk w="monetary"/> Fund and the OECD ( Organisation for Economic Co-operation and <unk w="employment"/> ) .

It is still true that a single currency without a single fiscal economic policy is , <unk w="there"/> will continue to be , a risky undertaking .

The appointment of a president of the euro area was the <unk w="first"/> step in this direction , but it is only the first step : more is now needed .

Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , after 10 years , the growing space carved out by the euro in international trade and its use as a reserve currency <unk w="and"/> that it has become a world benchmark .

It has guaranteed monetary stability and has helped integrate the economies of the <unk w="member"/> States that have adopted it , despite some errors of judgment that created problems for citizens both because of the actual exchange <unk w="rate"/> between national currencies and the euro <unk w=","/> because of the few checks <unk w="are"/> carried out on the prices of goods and services .

It was the result of the free <unk w="trade"/> together of 11 <unk w=","/> who believed in the creation of an economic and monetary union , as laid down in the Treaties , as an essential step in attempting to achieve the <unk w="european"/> union <unk w="and"/> still unfortunately remains out of our grasp .

Some problems that have occurred <unk w="in"/> <unk w="regard"/> to inefficiencies in a system that <unk w="is"/> unprepared for the task of guiding the other great associated phenomenon ; I am talking about the increasing pace <unk w="of"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and the great changes in the way trade is conducted at international level .

The euro has made it possible to face up to a series of difficulties , the most severe of which is the current financial crisis , and it has protected <unk w="itself"/> against the great stresses that have <unk w="sold"/> the markets .

Were it not for the euro , we would <unk w="have"/> repeated the experience of 1992 , only worse .

The measures introduced by the European Central <unk w="bank"/> ( ECB ) and the Commission to combat the current crisis have acted as a buffer and a form of containment but we still maintain , as we have often done <unk w="in"/> this Chamber , that we find it inconceivable to <unk w="have"/> a monetary policy disconnected from economic policy .

Admittedly , the actual situation is somewhat anomalous : 16 Member States <unk w="of"/> the single currency , 27 national economic policies coordinated by the Commission as well as it can , and <unk w="the"/> Member States with national currencies .

Coordinating a monetary policy with an economic policy that does not actually exist is certainly no mean feat , but if the institutions responsible for economic policies in our countries do not <unk w="deal"/> with the central banks and the ECB , which <unk w="seek"/> to pull all those policies together , and vice versa , the European Union will find new difficulties in jointly facing up to the current crisis <unk w="but"/> also the continual challenges that the outside world and globalisation bring home to us .

<unk w="i"/> hope that recent experiences <unk w="and"/> people of the need to face up to change in Europe , restoring the real economy to the centre <unk w="for"/> ensuring better cohesion and connection between the ECB and the European institutions responsible for laying down political and planning strategy .

The very recent energy crisis has also shown us that a common economic policy on the main strategic topics is of vital interest to the public and cannot <unk w="be"/> delayed .

If the political will is <unk w="concerned"/> , the introduction of such a policy will be <unk w="accompanied"/> by the <unk w="nuclear"/> power <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="eu"/> .

Mr President , Mr Giscard d 'Estaing , Mr Juncker , Mr Trichet , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to remind you how , in 1992 , when it was still <unk w="very"/> dubious as <unk w="to"/> whether the French would vote <unk w="in"/> favour of the Maastricht Treaty , Jacques Delors spoke to the general assembly of the French Green Party , which managed to deliver the missing 1 % or 2 % .

He said to us : ' Vote for the <unk w="resolution"/> , then we <unk w="must"/> have a political Europe , because if we do not create a political Europe to control Europe , the people will not accept it ; they will never accept it . '

The Maastricht <unk w="treaty"/> was approved , but no political Europe was created .

This is the <unk w="only"/> problem <unk w="that"/> we are facing today .

Firstly , it seemed to us that the Maastricht criteria were going to drag Europe into at least five years of pro-cyclical recessionary policy and , secondly , the way in which the monetary policy was incorporated into the <unk w="new"/> economic <unk w="protocol"/> by the Maastricht Treaty was not satisfactory .

At the moment , when the world is being threatened by deflation and the situation is being aggravated by the tendency of some countries to hastily cut their VAT rate as part of a Keynesian policy , it is obvious that <unk w="in"/> this target of 2 % is no longer just <unk w="to"/> show .

If we fail <unk w="to"/> keep to this 2 % target we run the risk of having very high real interest rates being forced on us .

<unk w="the"/> second major reform is obviously the reform of <unk w="the"/> Stability and Growth Pact carried out in 2005 , which allows us today to have a policy that is contracyclical and aimed at countering the crisis .

Secondly , the European Central Bank 's objective is not only to maintain a rate close to 2 % but also to <unk w="support"/> Europe 's policy , by that I mean the Lisbon and Gothenburg Strategies .

We need to have a <unk w="need"/> for refinancing and rediscounting private debts by the European Central Bank according to the Gothenburg and Lisbon Strategies .

It is regrettable that we are not taking advantage of <unk w="the"/> opportunity for an in-depth examination of the consequences of implementing neoliberal and monetarist policies - using the <unk w="internet"/> as an excuse - which have contributed to the current <unk w="european"/> social situation and to increasing inequality , unemployment , precarious and poorly paid work , and poverty .

It is <unk w="true"/> that we are holding onto ideological dogmas , such as price stability and the irrational criteria of the <unk w="stability"/> and Growth Pact , which are being used as a pretext in order to pursue privatisation <unk w="and"/> remove responsibility for social functions <unk w="in"/> the state .

This approach also involves <unk w="the"/> idea of the minimal state and the greater efficiency of the private sector , with the aim of imposing acceptance of so-called wage restraint , which actually results in low , nominal wage rises and even a reduction in real wages , as the Portuguese case regrettably clearly demonstrates .

We cannot agree with the false independence of the European Central Bank , which is dragging its heels on the decisions to reduce interest rates and which <unk w="is"/> keeping the euro overvalued solely to protect those countries with more developed economies and the more powerful economic and financial groups , thus worsening the hardships of the more fragile economies and those <unk w="working"/> with fewer financial resources .

This European Central Bank policy has resulted in the contraction of the European economy , clearly demonstrating the need for further reductions in the <unk w="public"/> interest rates .

As the purchasing power of workers , the retired and pensioners has fallen <unk w="over"/> the last 10 years , the profits of economic and financial groups have reached <unk w="the"/> highest <unk w="level"/> in 30 years , resulting in the joy and satisfaction that we have heard in this Chamber .

Even now , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> crisis situation that they have caused , what they are doing is nationalising the damage in order to then privatise the profits , whilst workers , <unk w="especially"/> <unk w=","/> small entrepreneurs , the retired <unk w="and"/> the unemployed suffer the consequences of the crisis , with the right , in the best-case <unk w="sector"/> , only to a few scraps .

Look at what <unk w="is"/> happening in the financial sector , where certain banks have already <unk w="had"/> their spreads more than once since the start of the financial crisis and where the margin charged has doubled in the space of a year , thereby <unk w="making"/> new credit even more .

We therefore insist on the urgent need for a proper break with these neoliberal and monetarist policies , putting <unk w="an"/> end to the Stability Pact , <unk w="tax"/> havens and the false independence of the European Central Bank .

We therefore insist on the need to significantly increase the EU budget based on a fair distribution of income and wealth , so that there is a real policy of economic and social cohesion and so that we reject measures that are just more of the same , in other words ' save yourself if you can ' measures , allowing the richest to become ever richer and the poor to become ever poorer , as <unk w="is"/> demonstrated by the increasing inequalities and disparities among the euro area economies .

We therefore insist on the <unk w="need"/> to support production and micro- , small <unk w="and"/> medium-sized enterprises ; to promote quality public services ; to facilitate credit and improve the purchasing power of families , and not just the most disadvantaged , but also the middle classes ; to create <unk w="new"/> jobs , <unk w="not"/> to reduce the poverty and misery <unk w="and"/> <unk w="millions"/> of people in our countries .

on behalf of the IND / <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> Group . - Mr President , do enjoy the 10th birthday of the euro because I very much doubt you will be celebrating the 20th .

Do you remember when the five-year plans were announced to be successes <unk w="as"/> before they were even launched , with much talk of record harvests and wonderful production figures <unk w="for"/> tractors ?

Much like those days , we have <unk w="been"/> treated <unk w="this"/> morning to a succession of unelected , ageing bureaucrats telling us what a great success the whole thing has been .

It was last July when the European Central Bank put interest rates up , just at the very moment that the markets were going into meltdown <unk w="interest"/> rates were being slashed across the rest of <unk w="the"/> world .

Of course none of this surprises me because what this euro is all about is a political class imposing its will <unk w="on"/> the peoples of Europe .

Remember <unk w="the"/> only two countries - Denmark and Sweden - had a <unk w="impact"/> on the euro and both of <unk w="people"/> said ' no ' , that little word that you try and avoid <unk w="what"/> you possibly can .

The euro zone has <unk w="already"/> been tested but it is about to be .

<unk w="however"/> , as German <unk w=","/> at the time said , should never have joined the euro , but the situation in Greece is , I think , where we should focus our attention .

Thousands <unk w="of"/> young people out on the <unk w="ground"/> demonstrating , demanding their government does something , demanding that their government cuts rates , demanding that their government devalues .

When people have taken away <unk w="from"/> them the ability to determine their own futures through the ballot box , then I am afraid that violence becomes the only logical alternative .

It will <unk w="be"/> leadership , or <unk w="of"/> the inevitable economic meltdown .

You can boo , you can jeer , but remember this : Britain outside of the euro has been able to devalue , has been able <unk w="to"/> slash interest rates .

We have been able <unk w="to"/> do the things that we need to do .

Jeer on if you like , but have you noticed that on the bond markets this morning <unk w=","/> <unk w="there"/> are trading 233 basis points higher than German bonds ?

Now I know that most of you in this room will not even <unk w="do"/> what <unk w="the"/> means and those that do will do their <unk w="best"/> to ignore it .

You can go on burying your heads in the <unk w="chamber"/> if you want .

<unk w="mr"/> President , in the last <unk w="few"/> years there have been at least half a <unk w="few"/> attempts to <unk w="use"/> single currencies or fixed exchange rate mechanisms .

All have failed , all have damaged <unk w="the"/> participants , and so it is with the euro .

Spain 's experience is like the bull <unk w="and"/> the corrida : proud and strong to start with , but bleeding to death in the sand by the end .

Greece 's recent <unk w="report"/> is clearly linked to unemployment , resulting from an overvalued euro .

Bond spreads between <unk w="france"/> and Germany have reached unprecedented <unk w="costs"/> - over 200 basis points .

in writing . - The tenth anniversary of the vote on the proposal , presented to Parliament , on behalf of <unk w="the"/> Council <unk w="of"/> Ministers , by Gordon Brown ( then president of the Council ) , to lock exchange rates at that day 's level and to create the euro , is <unk w="an"/> opportunity to <unk w="wait"/> ten years of success , stability and strength of what is now one of the two leading currencies in the world .

The current economic crisis would have been compounded <unk w="and"/> turmoil on currency markets had we still had the peseta , lira , drachma and <unk w="so"/> on as separate currencies fluctuating wildly against each other .

The euro has been a rock of stability for its members , as <unk w="stated"/> by the contrasting fortunes of Iceland and Ireland .

The anniversary is also an opportunity to debate <unk w="in"/> Britain 's long-term economic future lies with euro membership .

Of course , Britain can manage in the short <unk w="term"/> outside the euro , but over time , we stand to lose <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> : our businesses are handicapped in the European market by conversion costs and hedging costs that their competitors in that market do not face ; and inward investors into <unk w="the"/> European market will prefer to be <unk w="that"/> the major currency area rather than the smaller one .

The formal sitting of the European Parliament marking the 10th anniversary of Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) at a time of serious crisis in the capitalist system follows repeated resolutions and reports by the European Parliament on the same subject and is yet another attempt to gild the <unk w="president-in-office"/> of the anti-grassroots , anti-labour <unk w="behalf"/> of the EU which , following the demise of socialism , proceeded to the Maastricht Treaty and its all-out attack on labour rights and freedoms .

EMU , the establishment of the European Central Bank and the launch of <unk w="the"/> euro are necessary links in the chain of capitalist restructurings being promoted by capital <unk w="in"/> order to defend itself against workers ' claims and safeguard its profitability by stepping up the exploitation of the working class and grassroots classes .

EMU protects the profits <unk w="of"/> the monopolies and facilitates privatisation <unk w="and"/> merger .

This past decade , <unk w="we"/> have seen their incomes shrink , industrial relations worsen , their insurance rights evaporate and health and education services deteriorate and made into privatised commodities .

Workers reject the European one-way street and its supporters , and also the Lisbon Strategy and the Lisbon Treaty , and are fighting against EMU <unk w="and"/> the EU itself <unk w="in"/> grassroots power and a grassroots economy .

In the debate about <unk w="the"/> euro I want to draw attention to three negative aspects of its performance .

Firstly , from the moment when the euro was introduced , in other words from 2002 to 2007 inclusive , the three Member States which were outside <unk w="the"/> euro area ( England , Sweden and Denmark ) developed faster than the countries which were in the euro area .

Gross national income in those countries <unk w=","/> almost twice as fast as the average for the euro area , and the level of unemployment was lower .

Secondly , the battle with the effects of the current financial and economic crisis is clearly more effective in those countries than in the euro <unk w="area"/> .

The central banks of England , Sweden and Denmark <unk w="very"/> quickly and clearly reduced interest rates while ensuring liquidity to commercial banks .

It also seems that <unk w="the"/> fiscal policy pursued by these countries will be more effective than the fiscal policy in the euro area .

Thirdly , new Member States which are preparing to enter the euro area <unk w="and"/> to comply with many monetary and fiscal criteria two years before entry .

Some of these criteria are mutually contradictory , such as the need to be present in the <unk w="european"/> II system - and therefore <unk w="we"/> need to maintain the national currency 's exchange rate against the euro within a fluctuation band of ± 15 % - and at the same time to maintain a low level of inflation .

Counteracting devaluation pressure on the national currency means the need for intervention by central banks , which means putting greater amounts of the national currency into circulation , which <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> increases inflationary pressure .

The euro was 10 years old on 1 January <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> .

This is something the countries that have been left <unk w="out"/> of the euro area have been made painfully aware of .

Although <unk w="the"/> 10th anniversary of the euro is overshadowed by worries of a possible deepening of the <unk w="union"/> , I trust in the euro area 's ability to emerge from the crisis .

This will nevertheless <unk w="make"/> considerable effort on the part of the Union .

According <unk w="to"/> the latest estimates , the effect of the agreed stimulus package will be considerably less than the 1.5 % of gross domestic product planned for the area .

The euro has been an unquestionable success , but <unk w="does"/> not have <unk w=","/> but for the continuous efforts made .

Now we need to strengthen Europe 's role in the <unk w="hands"/> of the financial markets .

We have <unk w="to"/> keep to the basic principles and criteria of Economic and Monetary Union .

On 1 January 2009 <unk w="the"/> euro became the official currency of <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> .

From that date , the double <unk w="ban"/> on three hills from the Slovak flag has also appeared on one-euro and two-euro coins and has been put into circulation <unk w="in"/> the euro area .

That day was a historic moment for Slovakia and we Slovaks are very proud to be the first country from the former Socialist bloc to introduce the euro in this symbolic year of the <unk w="first"/> anniversary of the euro area .

I am appreciative of the fact that the current Slovak Government has subscribed to the commitment of Mikuláš Dzurinda , whose cabinet , in autumn 2004 , adopted a plan to <unk w="reform"/> the koruna with the European currency and fixed the beginning of 2009 as the <unk w="result"/> date .

It also seems appropriate here on the floor of the EP to thank the <unk w="turkish"/> people because it was they , as the main actors in the challenging but necessary ' Dzurinda ' reforms , who persevered <unk w="have"/> helped Slovakia <unk w="has"/> become a successful European country .

From 1 January 2009 the euro will link the people of Slovakia to <unk w="the"/> Union every day .

The finalisation of the <unk w="economic"/> <unk w="and"/> Monetary Union process demonstrated <unk w="member"/> States ' commitment to safeguard the EU 's economic and political unity .

The euro 's success therefore means <unk w=","/> in the process of building an entity designed to promote European values at international level and confirm the European Union as the main player <unk w="on"/> business and financial relations <unk w="in"/> the global economy .

I believe <unk w="that"/> the benefits offered by adopting the euro , involving macroeconomic stability , a significant reduction in price fluctuations , the promotion of job creation and support <unk w="the"/> productivity growth , all underpinned by strengthening resistance to external shocks , justify all the efforts made by the new Member States , especially Romania , to <unk w="satisfy"/> the convergence criteria as soon as possible and join the euro area .

Since the euro was launched on 1 January 1999 , the <unk w="european"/> currency has , in many respects , proven to be an important factor in the stability of the EU economy .

<unk w="the"/> single currency is , first of all , a driving force for European exchanges : the disappearance of exchange rates in the euro countries is an important and visible benefit for citizens , and promotes mobility within the EU .

Finally , though , the euro is <unk w="also"/> a symbol of European integration and the long road that the European people have already travelled together .

Monetary union is the next logical step after economic union , and should also pave the way <unk w="for"/> deeper European integration .

Nearly one <unk w="month"/> ago , when marking the 10th anniversary of the creation of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) and <unk w="economic"/> and Monetary Union ( <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> ) , we highlighted the fact that : ' In the ten years it <unk w="has"/> been in existence , the <unk w="progress"/> achieved by EMU are a resounding success . '

I think that this assessment is quite appropriate as I am a strong believer in the importance of the solidarity which Member States need to show in their joint actions to combat the effects of the financial crisis and reduce the adverse impact of <unk w="the"/> global economic crisis .

Europe is in its <unk w="already"/> precarious economic situation since <unk w="the"/> end of the Second World <unk w="war"/> .

Europe 's competitiveness has to be maintained within the euro <unk w="zone"/> and must be boosted in Member States which are preparing to join the euro area .

Madam President , we do seem to be having rather a lot of roll-call votes at <unk w="the"/> moment , which is a little <unk w="easy"/> for people like me whose machines are not working .

Could I <unk w="therefore"/> record ' yes ' votes for everything and ask for a technician ?

Framework for Community action to achieve a <unk w="better"/> use of pesticides (

Could we not amend the allocation of seats if we want to have <unk w="more"/> cameras here ?

If not , someone really needs to come <unk w="up"/> with a better <unk w="a"/> solution .

Madam President , I have been trying <unk w="to"/> <unk w="respond"/> to an usher throughout the voting procedure in order to give explanations of vote , but because you conducted votes so brilliantly and we got through them so quickly , an usher has not quite made it too <unk w="again"/> yet .

I would appreciate it if you would <unk w="invite"/> me to do that .

Madam President , likewise , if I could have the same <unk w="outcome"/> .

My request is on <unk w="the"/> way to you as well .

I rarely get such an opportunity to make myself heard by so <unk w="much"/> .

I am absolutely in favour of the European Union making it <unk w="as"/> easy as possible for these Balkan states to join <unk w="the"/> European Union .

I believe that it is important for economic aid to be higher than that allocated to date , <unk w="and"/> that we should make it possible to increase links between the Balkan states and Europe , develop tourism and allow all Balkan citizens , young <unk w="people"/> old , to live a better life than they have until now .

In fact , I completely support the McGuinness report on food <unk w="safety"/> - but I will check <unk w="them"/> with the services later .

I particularly <unk w="agree"/> with the point that we need to adapt the CAP to meet <unk w="social"/> security concerns <unk w="about"/> the fact that farmers need a stable policy environment in order <unk w="to"/> plan for the future .

We cannot have certainty , but <unk w="we"/> certainly need to have some stability .

In addition , I support the fact that the market alone cannot provide <unk w="the"/> security for producers and also the call for a detailed impact assessment , in particular , let us say , on the implications for food security .

If we look at particular <unk w="these"/> proposals , for example on plant protection , again we need a proper detailed impact assessment on that , and we need to take food security into consideration when we conduct that assessment .

It presents a clear statement of the view of this House on agriculture policy , not just at the European level , but <unk w="also"/> at a global level .

In particular - and this <unk w="is"/> important - it calls for a refocus on <unk w="competition"/> policy in the developing world , providing assistance to those who can produce food <unk w="to"/> do so locally .

I believe the EUR 1 billion that the European <unk w="union"/> will provide <unk w="for"/> this purpose is a step in the right direction .

I believe it is a blueprint for the future <unk w="in"/> terms of how this <unk w="exchange"/> views agriculture .

Nobody could be against that , <unk w="and"/> I am certainly not against that .

But the problem with the report , in my view , is that it looks and <unk w="better"/> to the common agricultural policy and <unk w="does"/> not address the fact that there is an urgent need for the reform , and further reform , of that <unk w="directive"/> .

Until that <unk w="time"/> is <unk w="far"/> away from the European <unk w="union"/> , then we are going to be in difficulties .

Yes , the objectives <unk w="of"/> the report <unk w="is"/> right , but I am afraid that it fails very badly in addressing the core problem .

( PL ) I fully endorse most of <unk w="the"/> proposals <unk w="and"/> statements contained in the McGuinness report , which was adopted a moment ago .

Sudden fluctuations in food prices are going to occur in the global market with increasing <unk w="competition"/> , which will have negative consequences .

It is just such people who deserve help : the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> needy people , both <unk w="in"/> developing countries and in the European Union .

It is a good idea to establish an international body which will observe the prices of <unk w="the"/> products and factors of their production under the auspices of the Food and Agriculture Organization , in order to monitor these data on a world scale <unk w=","/> to be able to react rapidly to fluctuations .

I think the establishment <unk w="of"/> a world system of storing <unk w="water"/> supplies should also be considered .

I think most people in this Chamber , from whatever part of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="political"/> spectrum they come from , would agree that food security is very <unk w="important"/> .

The problem is that we do <unk w="not"/> agree on what food security is .

<unk w="social"/> security to them means only food produced in the EU for Europeans .

I hear people using the excuse of food security to keep out imports from the rest of the world , thereby condemning the high-quality exports that we see from many of the poorer countries <unk w="in"/> the world and condemning many <unk w="young"/> farmers in poorer countries to poverty .

Madam President , I <unk w="agree"/> with the comments made by my excellent colleague Mr Syed Kamall on this matter .

About three minutes after we voted for this report we were basically ensuring that our <unk w="citizens"/> would not be able to grow enough <unk w=","/> for our <unk w="citizens"/> in the future .

It is a shame that nobody else seems to read some of these reports that <unk w=","/> through <unk w="this"/> place .

Madam President , one of the <unk w="main"/> concerns and one of the keys in relation to global food security is to ensure sufficient , sustainable production and , indeed , food <unk w="production"/> in the so-called developed world , <unk w="such"/> as here in <unk w="the"/> EU , so <unk w="that"/> we can export <unk w="a"/> surplus production and are not competing <unk w="heavily"/> on world markets for food , thereby increasing the prices for those in regions who do not have <unk w="any"/> <unk w="protection"/> , the soil , the <unk w="dollar"/> and the investment to produce their own food .

We have to be <unk w="very"/> careful with our policies to ensure that we are responding not only environmentally but also globally to the necessity for sustainable food production .

( SK ) I voted for the report on the common agricultural policy and global food security because it deals with issues <unk w="which"/> I have <unk w="always"/> been raising in the European Parliament as matters of priority .

The second issue is <unk w="a"/> reduction in <unk w="the"/> volatility of food markets , <unk w="caused"/> by increasing stocks .

The <unk w="second"/> issue concerns halting the decline in the social <unk w="effects"/> of <unk w="irish"/> by increasing public awareness of its unique and irreplaceable role .

The fourth issue concerns ending the random operation of the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) by implementing a <unk w="common"/> organisation of the policy with a focus on long-term objectives .

<unk w="the"/> fifth and final <unk w="thematic"/> involves putting a stop to the agricultural decline in the new Member States caused by the CAP 's discriminatory principles , while significantly boosting utilisation of <unk w="the"/> agricultural potential in these countries , the new Member States .

The public , on being given a <unk w="priority"/> in the Republic <unk w="of"/> Ireland , made it absolutely clear that they do <unk w="not"/> want it and if the <unk w="people"/> of Britain were to be given a chance - and they should have been because they were <unk w="doing"/> it in the last general election by the <unk w="irish"/> Government - they would also vote overwhelmingly to reject this Treaty .

The message should <unk w="be"/> heard loud and clear in the European Union , it really should : people do not want it .

Madam President , first of all I would <unk w="like"/> to say that this is an excellent report .

We are always speaking about <unk w="giving"/> the EU to its citizens and the fact that the EU project cannot proceed without the involvement of EU citizens .

There are two <unk w="pillars"/> of democracy : representative , which we have in this <unk w="chamber"/> , and participative , which is what this report is all about .

However , it <unk w="is"/> important to understand that civil dialogue is two-sided .

Therefore , the concerns and ideas put forward by citizens must be taken into <unk w="account"/> by the EU institutions .

I disagree with the last speaker because I believe , if we do <unk w="everything"/> the Lisbon Treaty , that it gives us the <unk w="opportunity"/> to connect citizens to the EU in a much more meaningful way .

Our role in this House is to ensure , if we pass <unk w="the"/> Lisbon Treaty , that it works effectively .

Madam President , much can be inferred from <unk w="the"/> title of this report : ' Perspectives for developing <unk w="the"/> dialogue under the <unk w="confines"/> of Lisbon ' .

Never mind that , as <unk w="it"/> seems periodically necessary to remind this House , the Treaty of Lisbon is not in force .

Focus rather on the Orwellian Ministry of Love bit of the title ' Perspectives for <unk w="the"/> civil dialogue ' .

Now , ordinary voters unversed in the peculiar idiom of the European Union might not understand those words , as we in this House <unk w="have"/> , to mean creating a new propaganda budget to try and convince people to change their minds .

Madam President , thank you for giving me <unk w="the"/> opportunity to explain the way I voted on this report .

When he was asked about Western civilisation , he <unk w="said"/> , that ' that would be a good <unk w="step"/> ' .

Therefore , when I read this title , ' Civil dialogue under the Treaty of Lisbon ' , I <unk w="hope"/> , ' that would be a good idea , would it not ? '

One of the previous speakers said that dialogue is very much a two-way process , but if <unk w="we"/> look at some <unk w="of"/> the civil society organisations being funded in order to promote the Treaty of Lisbon , we only see organisations that are <unk w="being"/> signed up to promoting this fundamentally undemocratic Treaty .

How many organisations that <unk w="are"/> against the Treaty will be funded or will be allowed to be promoted ?

There is no two-way <unk w="solution"/> , and that is why the citizens of the EU , when they are given the chance and asked about the Treaty of Lisbon , will choose to reject it .

I wanted to speak on this but I have just got too much to say today , I am so excited by all <unk w="the"/> votes that have been going through the Chamber today .

If you want to <unk w="look"/> at a sustainable fisheries policy , you have <unk w="to"/> look at <unk w="their"/> rights and <unk w="other"/> solutions .

That is the <unk w="right"/> way to make sure that we have sustainable fish stocks , not some artificial communistic method where you have central planning in fishing .

That is why we are seeing great <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of fish stocks , and we will all suffer in the end .

We will return <unk w="to"/> the explanations of vote after the formal sitting .

Mr President of <unk w="the"/> Republic of Latvia , the right honourable Valdis Zatlers , it is a very great pleasure for us all to be able to welcome you today on your first visit to <unk w="the"/> European Parliament .

I should like to start by thanking you , as the President of a country which is still a <unk w="completely"/> new Member State of the European Union , for <unk w="example"/> the European Parliament 's invitation to address us today , the day on which we <unk w="are"/> celebrating the 10th anniversary of our common currency , the <unk w="eu"/> .

<unk w="if"/> I take this opportunity to mention once again today the historic significance of the enlargement of the European Union in 2004 .

It took over 60 years to bring your country back into a free and democratic <unk w="state"/> and unify our continent .

Our citizens enjoy prospects that our forefathers <unk w="can"/> only have dreamed of .

It is true that today the European Union faces new and <unk w="new"/> challenges .

It is precisely in times of crisis that we understand the value of membership of a European Union <unk w="based"/> on the principle of solidarity between its peoples .

It is precisely in this time of <unk w="time"/> that we all feel the need for <unk w="better"/> <unk w="and"/> cooperation between our countries and the European institutions .

Together we are stronger , together we can defend our interests and values <unk w="and"/> throughout the world .

That is also why the European <unk w="union"/> hopes the Lisbon Treaty , which gives the European Union a stronger capacity <unk w="to"/> act to overcome these serious challenges , will shortly enter into force .

In this respect , the European <unk w="parliament"/> elections due to take place in June this year are immensely important , because we want to push ahead with the success story of the European <unk w="union"/> and unification project together , in a democratic European Union with a <unk w="european"/> Parliament with codecision powers in nearly every area .

I truly hope that the citizens of Latvia - and of all the other Member <unk w="states"/> of the European Union - will understand that their vote is important because it gives them European powers of codecision and in this sense will turn out in force during the forthcoming elections to the European Parliament .

Mr President , <unk w="ladies"/> and gentlemen , I thank the President for his kind words of introduction and his invitation to address the elected representatives of the nations of <unk w="europe"/> .

I take great pleasure in addressing the European Parliament <unk w="in"/> my mother tongue , especially because for five years now , Latvian has been one of the official <unk w="languages"/> of the European Union .

I thank you for having carried out <unk w="his"/> duties with distinction .

Dear friends , this year , 2009 , is a <unk w="very"/> significant year for Latvia .

It is five years <unk w="to"/> Latvia acceded to the European Union and to NATO .

<unk w="we"/> clearly expressed its wish to participate in <unk w="democracy"/> and transatlantic economic and security structures .

The enlargement of the family of European democratic nations in the first decade of the 21st century represented the most dynamic changes in Europe <unk w=","/> the foundation of the European Union .

European structures were joined by nations that had long been isolated by force from them , even though the values that lie at the heart of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="european"/> Union had historically been rooted in these nations .

Latvia has always felt itself to belong to Europe and its values , even when Latvia and other Central and Eastern European nations were long <unk w="up"/> to a state where many values were looked at through a special ideological prism .

Peace reigned among the nations of the Eastern bloc , but it was the peace of the <unk w="european"/> courtyard .

It was <unk w="also"/> about by the presence of tanks , repression and threats .

We <unk w="have"/> a common history , but our fates have been <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .

This declaration reminds the <unk w="whole"/> of Europe of these tragic events in the history of Latvia <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="whole"/> of Europe .

Today , I should like to <unk w="look"/> at <unk w="the"/> more recent history .

This year marks five years since Latvia became a <unk w="member"/> of the European Union and of <unk w="course"/> .

Firstly , the aspiration to become part of <unk w="has"/> encouraged the consolidation of democracy in <unk w="civil"/> society <unk w=","/> contributed to the development of democratic institutions .

With our accession to <unk w="the"/> European Union , Latvia signalled its determination for its own future , its determination to found its future on a European identity and on our common values : freedom and <unk w="democracy"/> , accountability , the rule of law and human rights , equality , tolerance <unk w="and"/> <unk w="democracy"/> .

' European money ' , as we commonly call <unk w="european"/> Union structural funds , has contributed significantly to the development of <unk w="europe"/> 's economy .

Thirdly , we can <unk w="support"/> the privileges afforded by the free movement of persons .

Free travel in the Schengen area has become so customary and self-evident ; it has become so natural to learn , work and gain experience in <unk w="the"/> European Union Member States .

Every entrepreneur and consumer can operate in a <unk w="way"/> <unk w="manner"/> without borders and without customs duties .

For <unk w="example"/> in a country with a small internal market , this is particularly important .

Fifthly , and most important of all , <unk w="our"/> voices are heard in Europe and European voices are heard in the world .

<unk w="we"/> can be proud that we have at our disposal <unk w="of"/> a unique mechanism of collaboration .

It allows all of us to search together for active solutions to global challenges , climate and demographic change , <unk w="the"/> reinforcement of energy security , the problems of <unk w="safety"/> , and in the case of <unk w="this"/> crisis , <unk w="on"/> a worldwide scale .

Latvia now has at its <unk w="present"/> new political and <unk w="financial"/> instruments , but it must be noted that our nation 's responsibility for the common future of Europe , a responsibility before all the people of Europe , has also <unk w="been"/> increased .

After accession to the European Union , the Latvian government lapsed into a sense of a ' job <unk w="'"/> <unk w="'"/> ' ; it had achieved its goal .

We did not recognise that we were only at the beginning <unk w="and"/> not at the end of the process .

The European Union offers great opportunities , but each <unk w="other"/> and each society must grasp them by itself .

<unk w="and"/> in Latvia have not grasped all the opportunities ; we have not always wisely <unk w="the"/> cohesion <unk w=","/> or <unk w="the"/> use of the financial opportunities we have <unk w="been"/> offered .

Our state institutions had to learn <unk w="how"/> to live <unk w="in"/> the European Union .

We have not been sufficiently determined to adopt the euro ; that is one of the <unk w="greatest"/> mistakes we have made in the euro integration process , something that is acutely evident today in the circumstances <unk w="of"/> the financial crisis .

Yet even <unk w="the"/> most hardened Eurosceptic must admit that Latvia 's membership of the European Union has on the whole been positive .

Is there anyone in Latvia who wants to return to a Europe <unk w="where"/> there <unk w=","/> customs barriers between nations ?

Is there anyone who wants to return to a world where <unk w="there"/> are restrictions on the free movement of workers , on their education and on their gaining experience ?

Ladies and gentlemen , the deterioration of the situation <unk w="of"/> the financial system and economy in recent months has irreversibly changed the role and significance of national governments within economic processes .

Until now , <unk w="the"/> financial markets were able <unk w="to"/> develop very freely .

What we can see from this global crisis , however , is that our financial systems and our economies are suffering from that market , and most important of all , real people are suffering <unk w="from"/> the crisis .

Late enough to still <unk w="be"/> the obstacle - the financial morass - on the road ahead of us , but no longer <unk w="is"/> to avoid it .

In this situation , a <unk w="european"/> approach at national , European and global level <unk w=","/> what is needed .

That will only <unk w="be"/> possible by <unk w="formulating"/> a new architecture and mechanisms for the <unk w="new"/> system .

<unk w="at"/> <unk w="at"/> European level , we have a significant advantage , for we can implement coordinated measures , take united action and achieve a sustainable solution .

It is an important step out of the morass in which <unk w="we"/> find ourselves at this time .

<unk w="thirdly"/> , Latvia is working on measures to <unk w="improve"/> the economy <unk w="in"/> order to stabilise the financial and economic situation swiftly and effectively .

<unk w="this"/> is a difficult task , but we shall succeed in overcoming the <unk w="situation"/> only by <unk w="such"/> a clear way out of it , and not <unk w="to"/> mistaking short-term solutions for a long-term vision <unk w="of"/> economic development .

At the end of last year , six political parties represented in the Latvian parliament , from both government and opposition , agreed on a common stance of support for the economic stabilisation <unk w="process"/> drawn up by the Latvian government .

This agreement <unk w="calls"/> for <unk w="greater"/> attention to be paid <unk w="for"/> monitoring how the <unk w="aid"/> granted to Latvia is utilised .

The plan defines the medium-term priorities <unk w="of"/> Latvia 's economy : support for exports , the promotion of free and fair competition , a significant <unk w="reduction"/> in the current-account deficit in the balance of payments , and the introduction of the euro in 2012 .

It is <unk w="important"/> for Latvia not to be left <unk w="behind"/> in <unk w="the"/> situation .

We are being helped to overcome this difficult time not only by international financial organisations but also by <unk w="the"/> <unk w="countries"/> of the European Union and by the nations <unk w="of"/> <unk w="parliament"/> .

Ladies and gentlemen , each enlargement has not only brought the European Union new Member States , but it has also introduced new accents <unk w="on"/> its agenda , including its foreign policy .

Since that time , there has <unk w="been"/> a particular increase in the European Union 's foreign policy activity towards its eastern neighbours .

Latvia will continue to play an active part in the determination <unk w="and"/> implementation of this policy in the future .

This policy is not just a matter of the European Union 's relations with particular states , that is , with those states with which it shares a land or maritime <unk w="safety"/> .

In the context of this <unk w="directive"/> , we must address the European Union 's place and role in the world .

A new political initiative , the ' <unk w="european"/> Partnership ' has come about , whose mission is to reshape Europe 's common neighbourhood policy and adapt it to the specific characteristics of <unk w="the"/> region , thereby <unk w="making"/> this process more active , more <unk w="effective"/> and more ambitious .

Latvia notes with pleasure the European Commission 's proposals in this <unk w="area"/> .

In developing the Eastern Partnership , attention must be paid to the differentiation principle , individual assessment and the attitude <unk w="of"/> each of the partners .

There are those states who wish <unk w="to"/> see themselves <unk w="as"/> <unk w="the"/> European Union , and there are those states that <unk w="have"/> chosen other goals for themselves .

Our policy will succeed <unk w=","/> if we are able to work <unk w="together"/> with all the states of this region , helping with understanding where necessary .

I also <unk w="see"/> positive signals for extending and deepening cooperation on my <unk w="visit"/> to the Central Asian <unk w="city"/> last October , when I visited <unk w="finland"/> , Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan .

Latvia 's particular contribution to the eastern dimension is the <unk w="eu"/> trust demonstrated <unk w="in"/> our bilateral relations , which <unk w="are"/> rooted in a shared period in history , and the expertise born out of that trust .

Latvia 's <unk w="introduction"/> is to <unk w="make"/> use of this special circumstance which could be lost within the next 10 years .

After several decades , to eastern eyes , <unk w="there"/> will be only one of the Member States of the European Union , not the gateway to Europe .

Making use of these advantages , Latvia will maintain an active political <unk w="solution"/> in order to encourage a better understanding of the European Union <unk w="and"/> its values in the neighbouring states and so clarify the <unk w="visibility"/> of the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Eastern Partnership .

<unk w="this"/> is of mutual benefit , and we have an opportunity to hear how neighbouring states perceive their future relations with the European Union .

Ladies and gentlemen , the question of energy security <unk w="has"/> very recently become topical during the first days of the Czech Presidency .

Questions associated with energy security and sustainable energy sources are , however , always <unk w="on"/> Europe 's <unk w="social"/> agenda and that of the world .

<unk w="this"/> means that this question cannot be viewed divorced from the world situation .

Even quite <unk w="clearly"/> , European Union Member States regarded energy as an issue <unk w="to"/> be resolved at the national and not at the European Union level .

The events of the last year in the energy sector , the interruptions to energy supply , the shrinking of energy resources and price volatility have helped <unk w="to"/> create a common understanding in European Union Member States of the need for a common energy <unk w="policy"/> .

At the <unk w="level"/> of energy <unk w="and"/> politics , <unk w="the"/> main task is to secure a regular , sufficient , economic , sustainable and environmentally <unk w="sustainable"/> energy supply .

You have to admit that the European Union has had <unk w="a"/> mixed success in this sphere .

On some issues , of which the development of an environmentally friendly energy economy is an example , we have <unk w="very"/> ambitious goals at the European level , which we must now begin to achieve .

On other issues - <unk w="electricity"/> of energy sources at European level and creation of a single energy market - we are right at the beginning of our <unk w="debate"/> .

The events of the last few days , involving a cut-off of gas supplies from Russia , has opened eyes to the need to find the quickest possible solution at <unk w="european"/> level .

We must not allow our resolve to vanish <unk w="it"/> with this spring 's snow .

The energy security question <unk w="can"/> only be successfully resolved by an active dialogue with the transit and supplier countries for energy resources .

Its initiative to <unk w="strengthen"/> energy security and solidarity also includes the development of the interconnection plan for the <unk w="european"/> energy market .

This will allow for a progressive integration <unk w="of"/> the Baltic States into the single European energy market .

I am convinced that strong regions from <unk w="the"/> Mediterranean to the Baltic Sea make for a strong European Union .

Ladies <unk w="and"/> gentlemen , the initial aim of the European Union - <unk w="the"/> security and wellbeing of the people of Europe - has not altered .

What has altered is the environment in <unk w="which"/> we must achieve this aim .

It is only with coherent , far-sighted and , most important of all , common <unk w="position"/> by the European Union that we can hope <unk w="that"/> <unk w="will"/> be <unk w="the"/> losers in this global <unk w="market"/> struggle .

Only thus can we attain the goal for which the <unk w="citizens"/> of our nations have cast their votes , in support of our participation in the European Union .

The European Parliament has already shown that it has a broad vision of the future <unk w="of"/> the European Union .

This is especially true of its uniform and <unk w="centralised"/> approach to the Union 's enlargement policy .

This growth is Europe 's potential , which it must exploit , so that the Union can , even several decades from now , <unk w="be"/> an equal economic partner for the rapidly growing Asian and Latin American economies .

It is <unk w="worth"/> yourselves in particular , as the democratically elected representatives of Europe 's nations , <unk w="i"/> feel the responsibility for this process most acutely .

<unk w="it"/> is important to unite in our multiformity and diversity .

<unk w="it"/> is a task that all Europeans <unk w="can"/> take on together .

It <unk w="is"/> essential to prevent <unk w="enlargement"/> of the European Union .

The agreement reached in <unk w="the"/> Council last month for the furtherance of the Lisbon Treaty is welcome .

The Lisbon Treaty is <unk w="a"/> legal precondition for <unk w="the"/> future fully effective functioning of the European Union .

Only by putting the principles of the Lisbon <unk w="summit"/> into practice shall we be able fully to realise the positive potential that the new , united Europe offers .

How effectively the <unk w="ec"/> Treaty will work in practice depends on the political will of the Member States and institutions and their ability to unite <unk w="and"/> achieving Europe 's goals .

Ladies and gentlemen , until 2004 , Latvia 's goal was <unk w="one"/> of the <unk w="european"/> Union .

We can define and achieve Latvia 's <unk w="growth"/> only if they match Europe 's common vision of the future .

For their part , Europe 's <unk w="citizens"/> are attainable if they correspond to the vision of every <unk w="member"/> State .

The <unk w="european"/> Union was built <unk w="up"/> <unk w="to"/> be strengthened on a base of common values .

Only public discussion can tease out those values that <unk w="are"/> common to all of us .

<unk w="so"/> in unison can we agree on those values that we are going to place alongside those on which the European Union was founded .

The post-crisis economic world will have <unk w="insight"/> into several economic power centres .

Europe will have the will and the ability to be united , for only union will afford us the chance <unk w="to"/> fulfil our tasks .

Moreover , the European Union will still be open to all those <unk w="involved"/> who <unk w="attend"/> its values .

The European Union will have expanded , <unk w="but"/> it will not lose the capability of effective action .

The European Union <unk w="must"/> be able to look after its own security and provide for stability in its neighbours .

Education and culture will be the <unk w="country"/> joining the different experiences of <unk w="the"/> European Union 's Member States and that will help to regain Europe 's leading role in the <unk w="balkans"/> in the realms of science and culture .

There will <unk w="no"/> longer be old and new , small and large European nations .

Europe will be united , and <unk w="european"/> unity will be secured by powerful regions , which while defending their own interests will work closely together with others , <unk w="thereby"/> creating a network of wellbeing and development throughout Europe .

That will <unk w="be"/> a time when Latvia will have emerged from the crisis .

Latvia 's capital city , Riga , will be <unk w="one"/> of the flourishing centres of the Baltic economic region .

In 2015 , for <unk w="the"/> first time in the history <unk w="of"/> the independent state , Latvia will be entrusted with solving questions on the European and global scale as the presiding Member State <unk w="of"/> the European Union .

Latvia and our region will be <unk w="a"/> bridge to the East , just as the Mediterranean states will join both shores of <unk w="the"/> sea .

Ladies and gentlemen , 2015 is not far away ; only six <unk w="people"/> stand between us .

Europeans will be proud that they live in Europe and <unk w="not"/> belong to <unk w="their"/> own nation .

Unity in diversity , development , preservation of values and every citizen 's <unk w="party"/> towards his or her nation and for the European family <unk w="as"/> a whole , that is <unk w="europe"/> 's future .

I call on you , as Members of the European Parliament , to <unk w="the"/> <unk w="citizens"/> ' understanding of our common goals and of how they will affect the life of every European in his or her own home .

I thank you , ladies <unk w="and"/> gentlemen , for your work in this session .

Mr President , may I thank you <unk w="on"/> behalf of the European Parliament for your <unk w="support"/> , for your European courageousness <unk w=","/> for your European determination .

We were of course <unk w="delighted"/> to hear that you value the European Parliament , and rightly so .

We have a very responsible Commissioner , a compatriot of yours , Andris Piebalgs , who acquitted himself admirably last week and during the <unk w="border"/> dispute with Russia and Ukraine , but especially with Russia .

Mr President , my <unk w="own"/> remark is this : you spoke about <unk w="how"/> you are learning and Latvia is learning .

If <unk w="we"/> are prepared to listen to each other and to learn from each other , <unk w="but"/> we <unk w="can"/> all be the better <unk w="for"/> it .

Thank you , President <unk w="prodi"/> , it was a joy to <unk w="inform"/> you here today .

( CS ) Madam President , I welcome the compromise , which will force governments of EU countries to create a timetable <unk w="to"/> draw up action plans to limit risks from the use of pesticides .

The restrictions on spraying by aircraft will surely be welcomed by EU citizens , as will the buffer zones for protecting drinking water <unk w="and"/> <unk w="genetically"/> organisms .

I voted for the directive because it is in <unk w="line"/> with <unk w="our"/> views on health <unk w="issues"/> .

<unk w="mr"/> President , I voted in favour of <unk w="this"/> compromise because it makes sense that we have sustainable use of pesticides .

I think the real problem is that there are such different rules across <unk w="member"/> States : <unk w="developing"/> countries apply training and education of operators in a very strict <unk w="way"/> and , therefore , have good sustainable use of pesticides , but not all countries do so .

I think this piece <unk w="of"/> legislation will make it appropriate <unk w="that"/> we have higher standards across the European <unk w="union"/> .

That is good both for those who operate sprays and for those who come into <unk w="contact"/> with them .

I think we are talking about a <unk w="very"/> sensible package here , so I was very happy to support it , and I congratulate the rapporteur .

There is no question that we need a regulatory <unk w="framework"/> for pesticides .

The Klaß report extends the range of controls <unk w="and"/> limits the use of PPPs to essential use .

Interestingly , while there was a very vexed <unk w="and"/> <unk w="of"/> hazard-versus-risk on <unk w="mrs"/> Breyer <unk w="report"/> , I have always felt that this issue is more suitable to the actual use as distinct from placing on the <unk w="ground"/> - in <unk w="other"/> words , this report .

Pesticides are only hazardous if the handler does not know what he or she is doing , if the application equipment is faulty , if the aquatic environment is ignored or if they are improperly stored and not part <unk w="of"/> an integrated pest-management plan .

The concept of quantitative use reduction needs careful management , as less frequent spraying with higher concentration of pesticide could <unk w="be"/> .

At the end of the <unk w="day"/> , these substances must be used to the <unk w="same"/> extent possible , as every farmer knows .

( CS ) Madam President , I would like to <unk w="say"/> again to yesterday 's plenary debate .

I consider <unk w="the"/> mutual recognition of approved pesticides according to geographical zones to be a positive achievement for our Parliament .

The preparation <unk w="of"/> a list of banned substances is <unk w="just"/> a step forward - <unk w="to"/> include carcinogens , genotoxic substances and also substances with neurotoxic and immunotoxic effects - and is based on scientific knowledge .

As the <unk w="commissioner"/> said yesterday , it seems that it applies to a relatively small percentage <unk w="of"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> substances still used today .

Commissioner , I also wanted to <unk w="have"/> a say on other reports but I was not given the floor .

Since I was a child there has been one vegetable that I hate : <unk w="""/> .

But I have the misfortune to represent Britain 's largest growing pea-growing <unk w="country"/> , <unk w="which"/> has given me a huge problem with the Breyer report .

I <unk w="agree"/> with the aims of <unk w="community"/> legislation to promote the health of our environment , the health of us as individuals , but it really potentially threatens a huge <unk w="oil"/> industry in my region .

<unk w="so"/> much soul-searching , I have abstained , but I wish to make it clear <unk w="that"/> I <unk w="commend"/> our legislative procedure in this respect was flawed .

We had so much information at the <unk w="moment"/> - conflicting and otherwise - <unk w="and"/> I , and I think many others , would have welcomed the possibility of a third <unk w="country"/> , or of conciliation , to make sure that we have <unk w="our"/> <unk w="our"/> interests .

I felt that the report was , in general , very well-balanced and constructive , and <unk w="it"/> was certainly designed to ensure a high level of <unk w="protection"/> for human health , animal health and the <unk w="environment"/> .

One of my concerns <unk w="is"/> that , when I talk to citizens about the EU , one of the issues <unk w="which"/> constantly raise with me is that , at times , the EU 's <unk w="position"/> is not always proportionate .

<unk w="however"/> , there is the precautionary principle , <unk w="but"/> we need to be mindful of this , but decisions also need to be evidence-based , and I would have liked a little more evidence in this matter .

Madam President , the efficient and effective use of pesticides <unk w="is"/> a necessity .

Whilst the protection of the environment and safeguarding of public health go hand-in-hand , I believe we have to balance the needs of consumers <unk w="and"/> producers .

Whilst I welcome <unk w="the"/> aims of the Breyer report to reduce red tape , I am not able to support this .

My biggest worry is that there has not been a proper impact assessment by the Commission and there is no clear indication of what this report will <unk w="be"/> for agriculture .

At a time of rising food prices around the world , I <unk w="do"/> not think that now is the time for us to have a knee-jerk reaction to introduce measures which may have adverse effects on food production .

That is why my <unk w="group"/> introduced an amendment for a thorough and long overdue impact assessment .

Madam <unk w="president"/> , like other colleagues , I should like to say that this was a very <unk w="important"/> dossier .

While Diana Wallis was concerned about peas , <unk w="i"/> can imagine that , in <unk w="fact"/> , potatoes were certainly on our menu and on the agenda .

<unk w="let"/> me say a few things about this - and I will end up with the key <unk w="points"/> .

I think we are now in a position where farmers need to lobby the agrochemical industry to produce safer <unk w="equipment"/> so that they can continue to produce food , and I think as much energy should go into that lobby as has gone heretofore .

When it comes to food <unk w="production"/> , the Commission need to address the genuine concerns of EU farmers and producers that they will be banned from using certain substances but third countries continue to use them .

We need <unk w="an"/> explanation of that in order to bring farmers with us .

The rapporteurs yesterday boasted <unk w="the"/> standardisation , and yet this is allegedly a Union of diversity .

If there were one area where judgement , discretion and diversity are needed , it is <unk w="worth"/> this .

This was essentially an agricultural issue , but the Danish Commissioner for agriculture was nowhere to be seen at <unk w="the"/> time , and that is a disgrace .

Farmers in my part of the world feel totally let down and frankly <unk w=","/> by the fact that there are some assumptions here that they do not know what they are doing , and they need to be told .

Essentially you have added yet another group to those in the <unk w="commission"/> who frankly <unk w="welcomed"/> the European Union 's interference .

Madam President , exaggerated claims have <unk w="been"/> made and fears expressed by all sides on this report .

It <unk w="now"/> has been difficult to <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> fact from <unk w="this"/> and to come to a decision on how to vote .

<unk w="so"/> I recognise the concerns of the soft fruit industry , the potato industry and the cereal farmers in Ireland who have <unk w="talk"/> to me about this , I supported the compromise .

The five-year derogation , renewable if <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> for essential plant protection projects , is an important safety net and also encourages the agrochemical industry to research and produce alternatives .

<unk w="mr"/> President , I think that , when one considers the European project , there is a dialectic at its heart .

We talk about democracy , yet we <unk w="hope"/> the democratic will as expressed in referenda in France , the Netherlands and Ireland .

We talk about food security , yet we vote on a report which has the potential to undermine <unk w="outermost"/> production in the European Union .

We talk about helping citizens and farmers in poorer countries , yet there will now be , as a result of this vote , a call to ban <unk w="them"/> from farmers who have used pesticides that are now banned in the European Union .

I simply have a plea to my <unk w="colleagues"/> in Parliament and to <unk w="the"/> Commission : Please , let us think in future about the unintended consequences of our legislation .

I agree it has been rushed through and I think we all agree that there has been an <unk w="environmental"/> impact assessment on a scientific basis .

Madam President , I tried to undermine the compromise <unk w="and"/> voting against those parts of this report .

I will <unk w="explain"/> why by reading out a letter to me from James Mowbray , who is a farmer near Skegness in my region .

I have always applied products with a <unk w="new"/> approach to other human beings as well as wildlife .

I therefore find it distressing that the possible withdrawal of many products , including the triazole fungicides , is based on less than scientific arguments and will <unk w="do"/> my business not particularly viable and reduce the availability of home-produced food ' .

I received these comments from him and from literally hundreds of other people , from Empire World Trade , based in Spalding in Lincolnshire , John Manby <unk w="and"/> Parker Farms in Leicester , John Clark , who is based in <unk w="democracy"/> , Jonathan Reading and hundreds more names .

Madam President , now that this vote is over and the arguments have been <unk w="made"/> , I would like to come back to something that ran through the debate here and in the committee .

In <unk w="this"/> experience <unk w=","/> is the opposite of the truth .

<unk w="however"/> , farmers have also been the basis of our health .

I would urge you to renew our faith in <unk w="young"/> farmers , <unk w="who"/> are doing their best to feed us in very difficult situations , circumstances of weather , pest and , of course , EU policy .

in writing . - We have just voted on an <unk w="instrument"/> for civil aviation safety .

Although travel <unk w="of"/> air <unk w="is"/> one of the safest means of travel , however , one can never take measures which are too safe .

Just like the issue <unk w="of"/> <unk w="that"/> one can never be too secure .

<unk w="however"/> , it is when we feel too secure that terror strikes again .

Of course , one has to find a <unk w="balance"/> between civil liberties and rights and security measures ; however , when it <unk w="comes"/> down to a choice one has to prioritise .

But surely <unk w=","/> security measures will enable an in-depth analysis not possible at the frontiers .

<unk w="many"/> civilians are purposely targeted and <unk w="the"/> civilians of certain countries preselected .

In such an environment surely we are not expecting these countries to abstain from doing all that which is possible to protect the interests of <unk w="european"/> citizens .

The negotiated agreement reflects <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and large the structure of a conventional aviation safety agreement ; it is based on mutual trust in each other 's systems and on the comparison of regulatory differences .

<unk w="the"/> <unk w="our"/> obligations and methods for cooperation between exporting and importing authorities .

However , <unk w="the"/> means of achieving this objective , namely cooperation and mutual acceptance of each other 's certification findings in the areas of airworthiness and maintenance , are set out in the annexes to the agreement , unlike in conventional agreements , where <unk w="these"/> measures are usually set out in separate non-binding agreements at civil aviation authority level .

The origins of the <unk w="fisheries"/> agreements between the European Community and the United States ( US ) lie in and are based on <unk w="the"/> liberalisation of air transport .

<unk w="these"/> agreements established at EU level ( or <unk w=")"/> , by the European Community - the only body that exists in law - and <unk w="the"/> single Community market , which they intend to fully liberalise ) are meant to prevail over any bilateral agreements established between various Member States and the US .

As in other resolutions previously adopted by the European Parliament , we would highlight that we are obviously the <unk w="right"/> to be interested in ensuring a ' high level of civil aviation safety ' and measures ' to minimize economic burdens on the aviation industry and operators from redundant regulatory oversight ' .

However , we must safeguard two important aspects : ( 1 ) the <unk w="legal"/> and presumed basis of these processes must not <unk w="serve"/> to create and facilitate the conditions for increasing the liberalisation of air transport , through the harmonisation of standards ; ( 2 ) these processes must not promote harmonisation through a lowering of safety standards and rules , in particular where , <unk w="on"/> safety , minimisation of burdens and liberalisation are mixed together , it is profit and concentration that prevail .

I agree in <unk w="particular"/> with Paolo Costa 's report on civil aviation .

It is important for the EU and the US to agree on a <unk w="budget"/> line with the help of this agreement .

Criteria <unk w="are"/> <unk w="be"/> found to which both parties must adhere .

In the event of contempt on the part of either the EU or the US , a rescindable variation in <unk w="the"/> agreement will be indispensable .

I voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of an <unk w="agreement"/> between the European Community and the United States of America on <unk w="terrorism"/> in the regulation of civil aviation safety .

I agree with the rapporteur 's proposal on the conclusion <unk w="of"/> this agreement .

I think that the objectives of the agreement , namely facilitation of trade in the goods and services covered by the agreement , maximum limitation of the duplication of assessments , tests and controls to significant regulatory differences and use of the certification system of either party to check conformity with the requirements of the other party are <unk w="two"/> objectives .

It establishes sound conditions for boosting trade in goods and services in the civil aviation sector between the European <unk w="union"/> and the United States , which undoubtedly benefits Europe .

In these conditions , we can hope that <unk w="the"/> European Single Sky principles will be extended in the future to apply to transatlantic cooperation and that cooperation will be widened in the field of research , as well as <unk w="the"/> implementation of new technologies in this field , based on collaboration between SESAR and NextGen .

I believe that this agreement will facilitate <unk w="in"/> the long term the mutually beneficial extension of the cooperation framework between the EASA and <unk w="the"/> FAA , from which airlines , the aviation industry <unk w="will"/> , more significantly , passengers will directly benefit .

The future of the external transport policy requires good relations between <unk w="the"/> European Community and the United States .

As a result , one <unk w="of"/> the fundamental <unk w="objectives"/> of this cooperation agreement on the regulation of civil aviation safety is mutual trust in each other 's systems and the comparison of regulatory differences .

The objective of this agreement is to facilitate trade in goods and services in the aviation sector , by <unk w="not"/> as much as possible the duplication of assessments , tests and controls <unk w="are"/> significant regulatory differences between the two parties .

We therefore believe <unk w="that"/> a framework is being created which will work smoothly on a <unk w="daily"/> basis and <unk w="will"/> <unk w="to"/> allow technical issues arising from its implementation to be solved through a system of continual cooperation and consultation .

This agreement is another fundamental step in the external dimension of the European transport policy , which is why I voted in <unk w="favour"/> of this report .

Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to state that I voted in favour <unk w="of"/> Mr Costa 's <unk w="report"/> on <unk w="the"/> conclusion of the agreement between the European Community and the United States of America on cooperation in the regulation <unk w="on"/> civil aviation safety , as <unk w="set"/> out in the proposal for a Council decision .

I concur with <unk w="the"/> rapporteur in considering that <unk w="it"/> must declare itself in favour of the conclusion of the agreement because this would clearly streamline the trade in goods and services between the parties in the airworthiness and maintenance <unk w="of"/> , avoiding the redundant duplication of assessments and checks on compliance with safety requirements , which until now have had to be repeated even if they are <unk w="not"/> similar to one another .

I believe , however , that the agreement should be applied provisionally at first , so that we can identify any practical <unk w="political"/> implementation difficulties and remove them before proceeding to final approval .

I voted in <unk w="favour"/> of the report on the common system of taxation applicable to mergers , divisions , partial divisions , transfers of assets <unk w="and"/> exchanges <unk w="and"/> shares concerning companies of <unk w="the"/> Member States as these legal transactions result in fundamental <unk w="legal"/> <unk w="of"/> commercial companies ' legal status .

I also supported it because I am a lawyer and I will continue to support in the European Parliament every effort made to harmonise and <unk w="looking"/> at European <unk w="union"/> fiscal , economic , civil and criminal regulations .

I voted in favour of this report as the Rules of Procedure of the Court of First Instance lack any provision as to the language required <unk w="to"/> be used in appeal proceedings ( against decisions of the Civil <unk w="criminal"/> Tribunal ) .

There is , in fact , no equivalent to Article <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice .

However , by its active engagement in the <unk w="agreements"/> which existed , the EU confirmed that the Balkans are an important region for us and are an integral part of Europe .

We are therefore obliged to <unk w="help"/> these countries in their efforts to achieve stability and full democracy .

I endorsed the Belder report because it underlines <unk w="the"/> need to assist the Balkan states , while treating them as <unk w="well"/> , independent partners .

Furthermore , it is good that the report underlines the <unk w="need"/> to establish a common energy policy .

The diversification of sources <unk w="are"/> urgently needed , and this <unk w="will"/> benefit not only the EU , but the whole of Europe .

in writing . - The report by Mr Belder considers the current situation of the European Union 's trade and economic relations with this increasingly stable <unk w="country"/> , where many countries hold <unk w="responsibility"/> for EU membership .

The role of the EU as a major partner for the area in maintaining trade and economic relations while pushing <unk w="for"/> a stable , lasting peace in the area is a very important one .

The EU 's strength as an economic partner , but <unk w="also"/> as a model for a strong civil society , government and dynamic institutions , should be used to push for the development of <unk w="the"/> region .

A threefold and differentiated approach , taking into account the relative differences between countries in the region as well <unk w="as"/> association agreements and further support , provides a clear way to address <unk w="matters"/> of underdevelopment and shore up intensive regional and international economic cooperation .

I know the Belder report only deals with the <unk w="economic"/> and commercial relationships with the Western Balkans and the evident need for the European <unk w="union"/> to assist in their reconstruction , in the economic , legal , political and social fields .

Above all , this <unk w="is"/> , always quick to condemn violations of human rights around the world or to demand ' human rights ' clauses <unk w="in"/> international cooperation agreements , has achieved the master stroke <unk w="and"/> voting for a report on the Balkans without once mentioning the dramatic and inadmissible situation of the Serb populations in Kosovo , who have become pariahs in the historical land of their fathers .

The consolidation of <unk w="our"/> relations with the Western Balkans is of immense importance both to the EU and to the Western Balkans .

In <unk w="view"/> of the fact that the future of the countries of the Western <unk w="balkans"/> lies with the <unk w="people"/> , their economic and political rapprochement to the EU is very important .

In order to tie these countries to the EU in the long term , the development of their market economies and regional cooperation <unk w="must"/> be fostered .

That is <unk w="a"/> constructive and positive signals from the European Parliament are also important .

It is in the interests of the EU to champion the creation of political stability , legal security <unk w="and"/> hence good framework conditions in these countries for foreign investment .

I am convinced that a positive development in <unk w="the"/> relations between the EU and the Western Balkans will be of benefit to all countries on the continent of Europe and I <unk w="welcome"/> the implementation of our proposals with anticipation .

Madam President , ladies <unk w="and"/> gentlemen , I voted in favour of the report by Mr Belder on trade and economic relations with the Western Balkans .

I agree with my fellow Member <unk w=","/> considering that the European Union <unk w="has"/> a vital part to <unk w="play"/> in the process of economic and political revival of countries in the Western Balkan area , with a view to their membership of the European Union , firstly in terms of stabilising the political situation and secondly in economic and trade terms .

I refer in particular to Croatia and the numerous Italian expatriates who continue to be <unk w="unfairly"/> discriminated against in that country , despite Croatia 's official application for admission to the EU .

This aspect is , in my opinion , at odds with the situation of Serbia , a country that has only been granted the status of potential candidate and <unk w="in"/> which the Union should be more open than it has been until now .

At the same time , linking the economic and trade policies of the countries in the Western Balkans to the European Union 's policy <unk w="to"/> support the stabilisation and association agreements signed between the EU and these countries .

I voted in favour of this report because economic <unk w="adjustments"/> may also lead to political stability in <unk w="this"/> area , which has been particularly troubled over the years .

The EU <unk w="must"/> use all available means <unk w="in"/> order to motivate the Western Balkans region and persuade <unk w="them"/> to carry out essential reforms .

The expansion of regional economic cooperation appears to be especially significant in this context , <unk w="and"/> also is the prospect of membership for states in the region .

Extensive <unk w=","/> stable economic <unk w="agreements"/> between particular countries would lead to specific economic integration , which <unk w="will"/> definitely help to limit the threat of conflict in the future .

The Balkans have already <unk w="demonstrated"/> huge advances on the road to rapprochement with the EU , but the prospect of accession will most certainly encourage states to continue their efforts at integration with the Community .

I would like to emphasise , however , that alongside instruments of <unk w="community"/> support , initiatives which aim to integrate Balkan society with the EU <unk w="is"/> equally significant .

Therefore the introduction of changes , which should <unk w="be"/> as far-reaching as possible <unk w=","/> which would make the movement of people easier , is very important , as also is broad support for the region 's young people .

Only if the people of <unk w="the"/> Balkans feel that they have equal rights with the other citizens of Europe will we be able to say that we have achieved success .

I totally agree with what Mr Belder had to say and with his recommendations on <unk w="how"/> to improve trade and economic relations with the Western Balkans .

The EU has a key role to play <unk w="in"/> the recovery of that region .

<unk w="it"/> is true that the level <unk w="of"/> development and adoption of the acquis communautaire is not the same in all the countries <unk w="in"/> that region , and so , in defiance of having a single strategy , it is <unk w="free"/> to choose specific approaches , which must be tailored to the needs in <unk w="future"/> .

The progress of the accession negotiations ( or their opening in the case of potential candidate countries ) with <unk w="the"/> Western Balkan states should , obviously , depend on full compliance with the Copenhagen criteria and unconditional respect for the principles of democracy and human rights .

Let it be clear , though , that all those countries have a future in the EU and that their membership will ensure <unk w="that"/> the dreadful conflicts which have typified that region for centuries are now a thing of the past .

The European Union has played an <unk w="extremely"/> important role in the process of economic and political reconstruction of the countries of the former Yugoslavia .

In connection with this , the EU is currently faced with the <unk w="long-term"/> task of reconstruction of the entire region .

<unk w="in"/> undertaking its actions , however , the EU must bear in <unk w="mind"/> the membership of some of the countries in the EU and the status of the others as potential candidates for membership .

It is difficult not to agree with the rapporteur that a basic condition for development of the countries under discussion is membership of the <unk w="free"/> Trade Organization ( Croatia , Albania and the former Yugoslavia are already members ) .

While appreciating the progress already made in terms of modernisation in the region , full integration of the Western <unk w="balkans"/> with the EU economic system should be <unk w="defined"/> .

in <unk w="afghanistan"/> . - ( SV ) The report on the common agricultural policy and global food security discusses important issues such as the consequences of rising food prices in <unk w="large"/> and rich countries and the importance of securing access to food for everyone .

We Swedish Social Democrats decided to vote against the report , as it contains problematic wordings in <unk w="relation"/> to agricultural policy .

Among other things , we would <unk w="like"/> to see a reduction in the proportion of the EU budget allocated <unk w="to"/> agricultural policy , the retention and development of cross-compliance and the adaptation of the system to the market .

in writing . - Securing sustainable food supply is one of the greatest <unk w="challenges"/> that faces us .

The current population growth rate is over <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> million per year .

This means providing food for 70 million <unk w="of"/> people every year .

This report is an acknowledgment of this and a recognition that the EU <unk w="has"/> high standards and wealth of agricultural experience can be of a wider value in addressing global food security , including by <unk w="the"/> funding for fertilisers and high-yield <unk w="projects"/> , as well as training and <unk w="financial"/> support for farmers and food <unk w="supplements"/> .

<unk w="in"/> writing . - ( DA ) Anne E. Jensen and Niels Busk have voted in favour of Mrs McGuinness 's own-initiative report on the common agricultural policy and global <unk w="social"/> security , <unk w="in"/> the majority of the report is excellent and it is only possible to vote either in favour or against .

in writing . - ( DA ) The Danish Members of the Socialist Group in the <unk w="european"/> Parliament have <unk w="voted"/> against the own-initiative report on the common agricultural policy and <unk w="on"/> food security , as the report opposes the liberalisation of agricultural policy and criticises EU rules on the restriction of pesticides .

We believe it is necessary <unk w="to"/> have balanced access to the global food <unk w="chain"/> , but that <unk w="it"/> will not be helped by either maintaining or extending the EU 's agricultural <unk w="policy"/> .

The global food problem is increasing rather than shrinking and affects all grassroots classes , not only in the less developed countries , but <unk w="also"/> in the more developed countries .

The main <unk w="purpose"/> of this situation is that the basic criterion for the production of agricultural produce and food is profit rather than global food requirements .

The trading of foodstuffs on international exchanges has resulted in spiralling price increases and , hence , spiralling profits for the food multinationals , a perceptible reduction <unk w="in"/> rural output and global food reserves and an increase in the number of malnourished people .

In order to address this unacceptable situation , which condemns one billion people to malnourishment and starvation , the report confines itself <unk w="to"/> <unk w="the"/> lists which are cancelled out by its insistence on abiding by the same policy : support for the common agricultural policy and its reviews and ' health check ' , <unk w="the"/> completion of <unk w="negotiations"/> in <unk w="the"/> World Trade Organization , the decoupling of aid from production and the continuing production of biofuels , <unk w="on"/> the pretext of the environment and using land which could <unk w="be"/> used to produce food .

The MEPs from the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report because , despite its findings and ' wishes ' , it <unk w="is"/> the anti-grassroots , pro-monopoly policy which is condemning more and more people to malnourishment and starvation .

in <unk w="afghanistan"/> . - ( SV ) It is important that we combat and alleviate starvation .

In this <unk w="respect"/> , I welcome the content of Mrs McGuinness 's own-initiative report on the common agricultural policy and global food security .

I <unk w="would"/> , nevertheless , chosen to abstain , because the report was strongly protectionist in places .

We are seeing <unk w="it"/> now in large <unk w="parts"/> of Africa , in particular .

the <unk w="fact"/> that the policy shift <unk w="has"/> resulted in a loss of potential market opportunities for EU producers and has led to increased reliance on imported food from outside the European Union , produced to very different production standards , thereby placing <unk w="more"/> agricultural products at a disadvantage ;

<unk w="we"/> concern that dramatic increases in agricultural production costs may result in less usage and reduced output , which will exacerbate the food crisis in Europe and the world ;

the concern about increasing market concentration in the food retail sector , which has led to the development of monopolies , and the need for alternative <unk w="charges"/> in negotiations with retailers , in favour of small farmers .

the increased orientation of the common <unk w="fisheries"/> policy towards the market and the devaluation of food sovereignty , with the emphasis solely being placed on food security , forgetting that this is difficult without food sovereignty .

Following the recent crisis in food <unk w="production"/> , food <unk w="production"/> should be an EU priority .

Bearing in mind that developing countries will probably not be able to produce food in sufficient quantities to supply their increasing populations , the industrialised countries will continue to have the <unk w="priority"/> task of producing and exporting food .

The common agricultural policy must therefore once again become a European priority and form the <unk w="establishment"/> of the <unk w="european"/> food security policy , <unk w="and"/> that , in a time of financial and economic crisis , it is more important than ever .

The Dutch People 's Party for Freedom and Democracy ( VVD ) <unk w=","/> has voted in favour of the McGuinness report on the common agricultural policy and global food security , despite the fact that it disapproves of some of the content in this report .

The VVD delegation would have liked to have seen the report clearly stipulate that the barriers to trade in the developing world should be phased <unk w="out"/> with reciprocity .

These still fall under the same procedure as ordinary <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> products , despite the fact that they make use of genetic materials from within the same species .

in <unk w="nice"/> . - The McGuinness report deals with issues of immense global importance .

Pressure on global food stocks are also coming from relatively new sources <unk w="such"/> as the move towards increased use of bio-fuels .

I welcome the general thrust of this report and , accordingly , voted <unk w="in"/> favour .

<unk w="mr"/> President , I voted in favour of <unk w="adopting"/> the report by Mrs McGuinness , but I would like to draw attention to <unk w="the"/> following issues in <unk w="committee"/> .

For the first time <unk w="in"/> the 1970s , we have been facing an acute worldwide <unk w="economic"/> crisis .

<unk w="this"/> crisis actually began before <unk w="the"/> present global economic crisis , at a time when world maize and wheat prices <unk w=","/> in a very short time .

It is dreadful to think that , even before the <unk w="challenges"/> posed by the current food <unk w="chain"/> , around a billion people worldwide suffered from chronic hunger <unk w="or"/> malnutrition .

Food security - access to a sufficient , safe and nutritious food <unk w="production"/> - must now become a key political priority both here and elsewhere .

We cannot tolerate a situation where , while worldwide famine increases and the price of food soars , we in <unk w="europe"/> are winding down agriculture drastically and for the oddest of reasons .

The food industry has a massive impact on employment , as it provides work <unk w="for"/> more than four million people in Europe .

There is an <unk w="urgent"/> need to protect these people 's jobs during these times of food and economic crisis .

in writing . - ( SV ) It is interesting to note that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has not chosen to include in its report a key issue proposed by the Committee on Development , which reads : ' the European Parliament calls on the Council and the Commission , in close consultation with the ACP countries , to give priority to the question of the impact on the ACP countries of EU subsidies on the export <unk w="of"/> EU agricultural products and to commit to <unk w="the"/> specific , sustainable responses aimed at avoiding dumping , in <unk w="accordance"/> with the commitments made in this area . '

However , in the report it <unk w="is"/> claimed that the EU has addressed the potentially trade-distorting elements of EU agricultural policy that can negatively impact on farmers in the developing world .

These two claims in the report are controversial , to say the least , and not something that all the political forces within the EU would agree <unk w="with"/> .

The report is also against reductions in aid payments within agriculture and is <unk w="not"/> <unk w="to"/> any reform of the common agricultural policy .

Regrettably , the issue of international trade is often missing from such <unk w="issues"/> , thus leading to the search for solutions which ignore the positive potential that increased world consumption can have .

The medium- <unk w="and"/> long-term profitability of European agriculture and rural development should <unk w="be"/> the <unk w="way"/> used in the common agricultural policy and its reform .

This report looks more like a defence of the current common agricultural policy than a comprehensive <unk w="series"/> of food security in a starving world .

Despite this I have supported it , because it draws attention to the importance of securing access to credit for farmers in developing countries so that they can modernise agricultural production and increase the output and quality of their <unk w="lives"/> .

I regret that the report paid little attention to the risks of land being bought up in the world <unk w="and"/> poorest countries for growing and exporting the cheapest possible food to the rest of the world , at the expense <unk w="of"/> the economic development and needs of local populations in countries suffering from chronic food shortages .

I <unk w="share"/> the concerns expressed by my <unk w="fellow"/> Member and draw attention to the need , which is more pressing than ever , for appropriate measures to be taken to guarantee all citizens access to healthy , nutritious food , whether they are resident within the European Union or elsewhere in the world .

I <unk w="want"/> to emphasise that our efforts <unk w="must"/> be viewed from a medium- to <unk w="the"/> perspective and not focused merely on the short term .

It will not be enough to earmark substantial funding for poor and developing countries unless this <unk w="is"/> backed <unk w="by"/> a serious commitment <unk w="to"/> industrialised countries <unk w="to"/> ward off the speculation on <unk w="the"/> prices of staple foods that we have seen recently and introduce international agreements that take into account the very varied situations of countries that belong to the World Trade Organization .

Otherwise the negotiations , which have already broken down , <unk w="will"/> continue to have little likelihood of success .

We <unk w="must"/> make sure that we play our part in the EU ensuring <unk w="that"/> the hungry across the world are fed .

The purpose of the common agricultural policy is not only to increase agricultural productivity <unk w="and"/> ensure rational development of farming production through optimal use of production factors , especially the workforce , <unk w="but"/> also to provide rural populations with a suitable standard of living , guarantee security <unk w=","/> supplies and ensure reasonable prices for supplies to consumers .

Access to sufficient supplies of safe and nutritious food is <unk w="therefore"/> a key political priority at EU and world <unk w="level"/> .

It <unk w="is"/> disturbing that food prices are higher than in previous years , and world food stocks have fallen to a critically low level .

There is a danger that the world financial crisis may induce developed countries not <unk w="to"/> honour their obligations in the area of aid to developing countries .

Medium- and long-term action is needed to safeguard world food production and to support <unk w="the"/> <unk w="people"/> who are most seriously affected in terms of basic nutritional needs .

The greatest challenge now is to develop a policy for agriculture and food which will meet the <unk w="objectives"/> of the increasingly numerous world population , which , according to estimates , by the year 2050 will have grown by 40 % , while world food demand is expected to double in the same <unk w="way"/> .

This is of fundamental importance <unk w="in"/> terms of safeguarding food production .

If the market is not able to ensure this , it should <unk w="be"/> done through appropriate policy .

in writing . - The Labour delegation will be voting in favour of the CAP and Global Food Security report , despite the strong reservations we have on <unk w="the"/> stance taken on the CAP .

We do not agree with the prominent role attributed to the CAP in ensuring food security nor with the criticism of the <unk w="middle"/> <unk w="presidency"/> , which has seen a shift away from quantity <unk w="for"/> quality production , the implication <unk w="considers"/> that this has undermined our food security .

Our position is that we need to modernise our agricultural policy , and not return to a production-based policy that encouraged massive over-production and a <unk w="shortage"/> of markets , undermining <unk w="the"/> ability <unk w="of"/> other countries to produce and trade agricultural goods .

We do , however , feel that the report raises many <unk w="of"/> <unk w="these"/> points on the issue of global food security , such as recognising the importance of food security as a key political priority for the EU , urging for greater cooperation on a global level , calling for more investment in developing countries to build up their production capacities , and urging for agriculture to be placed at the heart of <unk w="the"/> EU 's development agenda .

All of these points are equally important and demand that we look beyond the narrow focus of those using this issue as justification <unk w="for"/> a more interventionist and protectionist <unk w="approach"/> and that we support the report .

in writing . - ( SV ) We Swedish Social Democrats voted in favour of the report by Mrs Grabowska on <unk w="financial"/> perspectives <unk w="for"/> developing civil dialogue <unk w="with"/> the Treaty of Lisbon .

Strengthening the dialogue with civil <unk w="society"/> is important for creating an EU that listens to and represents <unk w="the"/> views of its citizens .

However , we would like to make it <unk w="clear"/> that we believe it to be wrong for churches and religious communities <unk w="must"/> be given a special status among civil society organisations .

Churches and religious communities should take part in the dialogue with the Union 's institutions in the same way as all other <unk w="countries"/> .

Madam President , every initiative which aims to bring citizens closer to the institutions which act on <unk w="their"/> behalf should be supported .

However , care should be taken to <unk w="ensure"/> that the proposed initiative is not by its own <unk w="caution"/> transformed into another institution .

I endorsed the report because every step taken to bring citizens closer to the authorities which make <unk w="sense"/> for them is a step towards a better and more transparent democracy .

However , I want to emphasise that , as is the case in every dialogue , so also in the one concerning the <unk w="maastricht"/> Treaty the opinion of <unk w="my"/> party should <unk w="be"/> taken into account .

It is therefore highly presumptuous , <unk w="not"/> to say arrogant , to be invoking the name of the Lisbon treaty as if it was already a fact of life .

In case you had forgotten : the Lisbon treaty was <unk w="rejected"/> by the democratic will of the <unk w="republic"/> of Ireland .

Ireland has been bullied into holding a <unk w="new"/> vote , but the Irish people are unlikely to take kindly to being treated with such contempt .

It <unk w="also"/> serves to expose the EU 's arrogant disregard for democratic opinion .

in writing . - ( NL ) I may be <unk w="calling"/> on a different planet , but I seem <unk w="to"/> remember that the Dutch and French people rejected the European Constitution in a democratic referendum in 2005 .

That Constitution is <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and buried , at least <unk w=","/> we call ourselves democrats .

The cursed Treaty of Lisbon , which is <unk w="also"/> an airbrushed version of the Constitution , suffered exactly the same fate , rejected , as it was , in a democratic referendum by the Irish people .

Europe , however , refuses to accept <unk w="the"/> opinion of the people and wants to ram the Constitution down the throats of Europeans through the <unk w="process"/> , pretending that everything in the garden is rosy and talking of a so-called ' dialogue with the citizen in the framework of the Treaty of Lisbon ' with the greatest cynicism .

This is supposed to be a ' dialogue with <unk w="the"/> citizen ' , ' a strong culture of consultation and dialogue ' , whereby the rapporteur , in her cynicism , quotes once more Article 10 of the Treaty on European Union : ' Every citizen shall have the right to participate in the democratic life of the Union ' .

<unk w="in"/> writing . - This report by Genowefa Grabowska provides for increased mechanisms of participation and for vehicles for civil dialogue within the European <unk w="union"/> .

It addresses the gap between members of the Union <unk w="and"/> the relationship they have with the institutions <unk w="to"/> serve them .

It recognises the need to <unk w="encourage"/> civil dialogue to maintain <unk w="its"/> engagement with the aims of the European project .

The recent rejection of the Lisbon Treaty in Ireland was in part due to differences <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="countries"/> of the Union and the reality of the Union .

Central to this proposal is the insistence that dialogue is reciprocal , that the opinions expressed need <unk w="to"/> be heeded and respected .

For this report , Ms <unk w="mollar"/> highlights both transparency and representativeness as essential components of active civil dialogue and a genuine participatory democracy .

A more open and accessible Council , increased and more integrated inter-institutional cooperation , better use of <unk w="the"/> media <unk w="as"/> a means to connect with citizens and providing assistance to civil society institutions will help bring Europe closer together .

in writing . - We support any and all efforts to empower citizens , communities and civil society <unk w=","/> with regard <unk w="to"/> political <unk w="and"/> <unk w="ministry"/> , including the EU .

Furthermore we believe that for the proposed Citizens Initiative to be meaningful , the <unk w="eu"/> should be under a legally binding obligation to produce a White Paper outlining a response to the proposal , <unk w="but"/> the Treaty basis for not taking action .

This report is yet another one which goes against the majority of the <unk w="european"/> Parliament in its efforts to try and ' sell ' the Treaty of Lisbon project at any cost , a task <unk w="that"/> has not proved easy , judging by the results of previous referendums .

These repeated efforts have at least <unk w="great"/> merit : they clearly show how difficult and even <unk w="if"/> it is for the Treaty 's advocates to find arguments <unk w="to"/> promote it .

No propaganda exists - and this is the subject of the report - which can disguise the anti-democratic nature of the insistence by the EU 's leaders on forcing another referendum in Ireland in order <unk w="to"/> impose this proposed Treaty .

We do not share the narrow view of those who consider that developing a ' <unk w="new"/> dialogue ' or a ' citizens ' initiative ' is sufficient to counteract <unk w="the"/> nature of a proposal which , <unk w="as"/> a whole , prevents the citizens of each Member State from defining <unk w="a"/> collective future , and which insists on measures resulting in precarious <unk w="conditions"/> , increased working hours , <unk w="collective"/> redundancies and the privatisation of public services .

If the Europe of Brussels wishes to hear the citizens , let it take note of the French and Dutch ' no ' to the European <unk w="union"/> and abandon the Treaty <unk w="in"/> Lisbon , which is a mere copy of the Constitution .

If opinion polls ought to be taken into account , as the rapporteur would like , put a stop <unk w="to"/> <unk w="the"/> negotiations for Turkey 's membership , because <unk w="the"/> majority of Europe 's citizens oppose it .

If it is right to <unk w="ignore"/> the principle that decisions should be taken as close as possible to the citizens , let Europe cease to rule over our daily lives .

in writing . - ( SV ) I voted in favour <unk w="of"/> the report by Mrs Grabowska <unk w="on"/> the perspectives for developing civil dialogue under the Treaty of <unk w="nice"/> .

I also <unk w="disagree"/> with the demands in the report for work in the Council to be more open in order to enable civil <unk w="society"/> to participate in the dialogue in a meaningful way .

It is also wrong for churches <unk w="or"/> religious communities to be given a special status among civil society organisations .

I agree with <unk w="the"/> <unk w="debate"/> on the <unk w="need"/> for developing civil dialogue under the Treaty of Lisbon .

I consider civil dialogue to be very important , <unk w="so"/> that the citizens of the EU can gain an insight into the areas of activity of their elected representatives .

I should like to highlight the comment that dialogue between the EU and the Union citizens should be a two-way dialogue , because it is not enough <unk w="to"/> inform our home countries about the implementation of projects ; we also have to listen to individual people and take their opinion seriously .

in writing . - ( SV ) The Treaty <unk w="of"/> Lisbon <unk w="has"/> not been adopted .

It was rejected by the voters of Ireland in a referendum and <unk w="it"/> must be considered dead .

What was , essentially , the same draft treaty had already been rejected in referendums <unk w=","/> <unk w="luxembourg"/> and the Netherlands .

However , the European Parliament <unk w="'s"/> federalist majority is unwilling to listen , insisting , instead , on a Union that is governed to an even greater extent at the <unk w="european"/> level , despite the fact that its citizens <unk w="have"/> shown their scepticism in multiple referendums and that , given the chance , they <unk w="must"/> show this scepticism in even more countries , too .

The way of working demonstrated by the European Parliament 's federalist majority <unk w=","/> what sort of a civil dialogue it is that they want .

Outside the legislative procedure , the <unk w="report"/> we have before us is not particularly impressive .

Paragraph 9 of the report states that all EU institutions should maintain up-to-date <unk w="control"/> of all relevant non-governmental organisations .

However , the worst aspect of the report is the call , <unk w="in"/> paragraph 22 , <unk w="to"/> give European associations and European civil society organisations a shared legal basis at EU level .

This <unk w="afternoon"/> is yet another step towards constructing an EU state .

It may sound really nice to talk of a public debate on the Treaty of Lisbon in <unk w="all"/> the languages .

Despite all the camouflage manoeuvres , the people have understood full well that a treaty that is 95 % <unk w=","/> keeping <unk w="with"/> the rejected <unk w="and"/> Constitution is no Columbus 's egg , even if the EU establishment is trying to market it as such .

It <unk w="is"/> also interesting , given that we want to conduct this dialogue in all the <unk w="countries"/> , that we <unk w="are"/> not even in a position to ensure that the President-in-Office of the Council has an integrated website in the most widely spoken languages in the Union , namely English , French and German .

We must also look <unk w="for"/> ridiculous to our citizens in praising the new civil initiatives provided for in the Constitution as a step towards more democracy , given that referendums are being repeated until the result wanted by <unk w="the"/> EU is obtained .

I voted in favour of this report as civil society plays an important role in Europe in the European integration process , by passing <unk w="that"/> the opinions and requests of EU citizens to Europe 's institutions .

For the <unk w="european"/> Union to be able to achieve its aims <unk w="and"/> objectives , it needs a broader public debate , a more effective civil dialogue and development of political <unk w="dialogue"/> , all aspects recognised in this report .

The report also highlights the importance of the expertise which civil society makes available to institutions and emphasises the role and significance of functions for informing and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="those"/> involved in <unk w="this"/> dialogue .

I am referring in <unk w="this"/> instance to initiatives such as Europe by Satellite , Citizens ' Agora and other citizen forums on various topics .

I hope that this report will encourage the European Union 's Council to facilitate <unk w="and"/> simplify access <unk w="of"/> its proceedings , as this is a basic condition for initiating a proper dialogue with <unk w="civil"/> society .

Ladies and <unk w="gentlemen"/> , I welcome the fact that the report draws attention to the need <unk w="for"/> social dialogue at a <unk w="time"/> when European <unk w="countries"/> are experiencing a democratic crisis .

People either do not understand or are not <unk w="involved"/> in <unk w="an"/> unrelated to their everyday concerns .

The low turnout in European elections is a logical consequence of the fact that <unk w="our"/> citizens do not know what positive contribution European legislation can make <unk w="to"/> them and they do not believe their <unk w="they"/> can have any influence .

However , it is necessary to ensure that they are representative and <unk w="not"/> .

I have backed the report also because it includes a request for the Commission to <unk w="examine"/> lists <unk w="of"/> the non-governmental organisations that have applied its proposals during the legislative preparations .

I also <unk w="share"/> the view that the election campaign for the European Parliament provides a great opportunity for responsible <unk w="interest"/> to explain what decisions we make in Strasbourg , how civil society participates in our work and how it will be able to participate <unk w="the"/> adoption of the Lisbon Treaty .

This is binding on <unk w="other"/> EU policies and spheres of activity .

The success of dialogue depends on representativeness , and therefore on the strong commitment <unk w="of"/> <unk w="legal"/> entities .

It should be admitted that <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> has a lot of ground <unk w="to"/> make up in the area of communication , and indeed especially in the area of dialogue with citizens .

The citizens of the <unk w="union"/> must be sure that no decisions at European level will be <unk w="involved"/> without their involvement , and that by <unk w="the"/> in elections they will have a real influence on the form of those decisions .

I fully support the call by <unk w="the"/> rapporteur to encourage the promotion of initiatives in the area of dialogue with citizens .

in writing . - It <unk w="is"/> premature to be talking about what will happen once the Lisbon treaty comes into effect .

While this remains the case , we should not be acting as if the Lisbon treaty is <unk w="currently"/> in force .

Furthermore , I am not in favour of EU funds <unk w="being"/> spent on promoting the Lisbon treaty through civil dialogue or any other <unk w="country"/> .

We have free media and vigorous democracies in the Member States and are quite capable of conducting this <unk w="debate"/> on our own terms without the Commission trying to influence matters .

The Grabowska report is <unk w="just"/> another example of the scandalous way in which this Parliament handles the principles <unk w="which"/> claims to serve .

' Dialogue with the citizen in the <unk w="light"/> of the Treaty of Lisbon ' : what a joke !

The Treaty of Lisbon , which is the ex-European Constitution in disguise , was <unk w="added"/> to the waste paper <unk w="and"/> in referendums in the Netherlands and <unk w="in"/> France , and subsequently also in Ireland .

If the outcome of a referendum is not to the liking of the Eurocratic nomenclatures , this does not necessarily mean that the voting public is lacking <unk w="in"/> brain cells .

<unk w="at"/> any rate , I emphatically voted against <unk w="the"/> report again .

However , particular interest groups , lobbies that do not <unk w="have"/> the common good , <unk w="must"/> not be allowed to <unk w="accelerate"/> the legislative process under the guise of a dialogue with civil society .

I insist that <unk w="we"/> should be especially <unk w="the"/> associations that give a voice <unk w="to"/> the poorest individuals and families .

The fight against extreme poverty and social inequalities will have no lasting success without a permanent <unk w="dialogue"/> with the families and individuals who experience extreme poverty in their daily lives .

In terms of best practice , we should recognise the work <unk w="of"/> the European Economic and Social Committee and the International Movement ATD Fourth World which , since 1989 , have been organising European sessions of Fourth World People 's Universities , which allow structured dialogue between representatives of the authorities and people with direct experience of extreme poverty .

in writing . - I abstained on this vote because , <unk w="like"/> I and the UK Independence Party fully support equality between men and women , the UK already has equality legislation which can be changed or improved when required by our own democratically elected and accountable Parliament .

The idea of creating a blacklist <unk w="of"/> unfair commercial practices , not only for business-to-consumer <unk w=","/> but also for business-to-business relations , is laudable .

I also support the mechanisms for monitoring and enforcement of the implementation of legal regulations in the area of consumer protection concerning unfair practices , and I support the initiative to <unk w="make"/> a publicly accessible database of national measures adopted in transposition of the Directive concerning unfair commercial <unk w="safety"/> .

From the point of view of the Polish and the European consumer , the <unk w="most"/> <unk w="is"/> valuable .

We abstained on the Weiler report on protecting consumers and companies against unfair practices <unk w="and"/> misleading advertising as we have major criticisms of it .

The first is that the European legislation on these issues is presented <unk w="in"/> a directive , in <unk w="other"/> words the Member States are relatively free in the resources they implement <unk w="to"/> achieve the objectives assigned to them .

The rapporteur 's wish for uniformity , both in the substance and in the form of national legislation , <unk w="will"/> remain a wish unless there is unacceptable interference <unk w="in"/> the European Union in the legal and administrative systems of the Member <unk w="states"/> , with no real benefit to consumers .

The second is that the <unk w="european"/> added value that <unk w="the"/> European Union brings <unk w="into"/> these areas is the help in resolving cross-border disputes .

This issue has <unk w="not"/> been properly resolved either in the current applicable texts or in those called for .

The Directive <unk w="requires"/> unfair commercial practices <unk w="in"/> the Directive concerning misleading and comparative advertising have immense significance in terms of giving consumers more confidence and ensuring legal certainty for businesses in <unk w="the"/> internal market .

National consumer protection authorities are still <unk w="facing"/> difficulties in taking appropriate action in the target country in the case of <unk w="commercial"/> transactions .

Unfortunately , a number of Member States have not yet fulfilled this obligation , which does not contribute to the <unk w="balance"/> of appropriate relationships between businesses and consumers .

<unk w="we"/> <unk w=","/> the European <unk w="union"/> used for the first time the ' EU Sweep ' as a tool to check and enforce the implementation of consumer protection legislation as regards <unk w="national"/> websites .

Irregularities were confirmed on as many as 43.6 % of the websites reviewed , which only confirms <unk w="the"/> necessity of greater monitoring in relation to the enforcement of existing provisions .

in writing . - The EU has made significant progress <unk w="towards"/> improving consumers ' rights .

It is disappointing that some Member States have yet to transpose the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive ; <unk w="and"/> this House has today sent a clear message that those Member States should address this shortcoming .

However , we still refuse to protect citizens <unk w=","/> Internet callers , unwanted advertising calls and Scammer & Co .

If <unk w="we"/> manage to catch any of these companies , they are sentenced to ridiculously small fines , which have no deterrent effect whatsoever .

<unk w="we"/> here need to be drastically increased , especially for repeat offences .

I welcome the debate on the report on the transposition , <unk w="implementation"/> and <unk w="application"/> of Directive 2005 / 29 / EC concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial <unk w="safety"/> in the internal market and Directive 2006 / 114 / EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising .

While these directives form the backbone of consumer protection in the EU , they must be <unk w="correctly"/> applied in the Member States , especially for Internet purchases .

I must draw your attention to <unk w="the"/> <unk w="fact"/> that some Member <unk w="states"/> , including the Czech Republic , have been late in transposing the directives <unk w="into"/> their national legislation .

It is also necessary <unk w="for"/> European institutions to support greater cooperation between the national councils for radio and television broadcasting which have to monitor compliance with the directives in the mass media and it is in <unk w="an"/> interest for the supervision to be applied consistently across the entire EU .

Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I am voting in favour of Mrs Weiler 's report on the transposition , implementation and enforcement of <unk w="directive"/> 2005 / 29 / EC concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the <unk w="internal"/> market and Directive 2006 / 114 / EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising .

I am firmly convinced that the proper <unk w="implementation"/> of <unk w="this"/> directive will make it possible for the public to be fully aware of their rights .

I agree with the rapporteur when she states that appropriate transposition , implementation and enforcement of the Directives on unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices and on misleading <unk w=","/> comparative advertising are of fundamental importance to the achievement of <unk w="the"/> aims laid down in the Directives , particularly in the light of the different application and implementation <unk w="of"/> and systems used in the Member States , the complexity <unk w="of"/> some of the legal concepts contained in the Directives , the <unk w="multiple"/> and exhaustive nature of national standards governing unfair commercial practices and misleading advertising and also the extensive range of application of the Directive .

Lastly , I am delighted by my fellow Member 's initiative , the aim of which is the legal regulation of a topic that is of paramount importance to <unk w="the"/> Community .

I definitely endorse Barbara Weiler 's report on the transposition , implementation and enforcement of the Directive concerning unfair commercial practices in the internal market and <unk w="the"/> Directive concerning misleading and comparative advertising .

The <unk w="problem"/> of misleading and comparative advertising in business-to-business transactions has been regulated by the introduction of a single , consolidated directive .

The issue of unfair commercial <unk w="trade"/> in business-to-consumer relations has been regulated <unk w="by"/> Directive <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> / 29 / EC .

The Directives were prepared to give <unk w="citizens"/> more confidence ( their protection has increased due to the drawing up of a ' blacklist ' of commercial practices <unk w="'"/> should be prohibited , and thanks to better harmonisation of the protection of consumers against unfair practices ) and also to provide businesses with greater legal certainty .

A greater degree of protection could <unk w="have"/> been achieved if the provisions of the Directive were accompanied by legal measures allowing effective enforcement .

Member States must therefore screen <unk w="the"/> legal systems and increase <unk w="the"/> clarity of the transposition process .

The changes introduced must be supported by clear procedures for implementation and effective measures for redress , which will <unk w="give"/> consumers the right to bring claims for <unk w="respect"/> for losses incurred in connection with <unk w="international"/> commercial practices , like the mechanisms for monitoring consumer protection in relation to airline websites first used in 2007 .

We believe that the report does not make it <unk w="clear"/> that the fisheries policy must be devised with environmental and sustainability criteria as the starting <unk w="point"/> .

In addition , the report focuses far too much on holding back on the necessary reforms of the fisheries policy and protects the interests of <unk w="the"/> large-scale fishing industry .

Summarised very briefly , this own-initiative report of the European Parliament aims to integrate the Community requirements for the conservation <unk w="of"/> the marine environment with the common fisheries policy ( CFP ) , which has , as one of its operational objectives , the gradual application of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management .

Alternative management systems should be quickly established and , against this backdrop , I consider that the EU should be swifter in discussing alternative approaches , given that some , such as management based on fishing rights ( for example ) , form <unk w="a"/> cornerstone in countries such as the United States , New Zealand , Norway and <unk w="germany"/> , all with a strong tradition <unk w="of"/> great potential in the fisheries sector .

It will <unk w="be"/> particularly important to reaffirm and defend these objectives and principles ( as <unk w="the"/> Portuguese Communist Party ( PCP ) has consistently done ) , many of which <unk w="are"/> not respected by the common fisheries policy ( CFP ) ( even though some are included in it ) , when the European Commission announces the presentation , next April , of a green paper on the future of the common fisheries policy , indicating a possible reform of this <unk w="directive"/> by 2012 .

Given the objectives and intentions which have been set out by the European Commission and other EU institutions on the future of the <unk w="audiovisual"/> industry , this sector in Portugal - which is in <unk w="the"/> crisis , the causes of which lie in the onerous policies followed <unk w="by"/> decades at national and Community level - <unk w="should"/> be alert to <unk w="we"/> should mobilise against new and even more <unk w="effective"/> measures .

The report correctly notes <unk w="that"/> EU fisheries policy should promote the modernisation and sustainable development of the fishing industry , safeguarding its socio-economic viability and the sustainability of fisheries resources , and guaranteeing <unk w="the"/> supply <unk w="of"/> fish to the public and food sovereignty and security , the preservation of jobs and improved living conditions for fishermen .

This is the opposite <unk w="of"/> what the CFP has achieved over the last three decades , and accordingly I support the repatriation of fisheries management .

It is of fundamental importance not to confuse sea or ocean policy <unk w="and"/> fishing policy : I totally agree with the rapporteur on this score .

A fishing policy must be based on the principle that an interdependence exists between the wellbeing of the fishing community and the sustainability of the ecosystems of which they form an integral part , particularly by acknowledging the specific nature and importance of small-scale coastal fishing <unk w="and"/> artisanal fishing .

If we adopt this approach , we will take a further step towards achieving the goals laid down <unk w="by"/> the European Union .

In this case also , the final compromise has ended up taking into account several of the criticisms that we <unk w="have"/> <unk w="in"/> the initial proposal , specifically with regard to reduction indicators <unk w=","/> targets , measures and timetables to reduce the risks and dangers associated with pesticides and the dependency on pesticides .

We also welcome the fact <unk w="that"/> the exemption from mandatory inspection of the equipment and accessories <unk w="covered"/> by the Commission 's initial proposal is maintained and that the mandatory inspection of everything , including equipment and accessories used on small-scale family-based holdings , has been dropped .

<unk w="however"/> , it should always be remembered that it was not family-based holdings and the non-intensive method of production <unk w="has"/> led to BSE , dioxins , nitrofurans and other food disasters ...

The entry into force of this directive will be extremely important in terms of increasing pressure for the urgent amendment of the pesticide risk reduction policy , which in the EU has been characterised by a certain lack <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> inspection of practices and products .

It also prohibits aerial spraying ( permitted in cases of absolute necessity and where <unk w="there"/> are no alternatives ) .

I abstained from voting on the ' pesticides package ' to protest against this anti-democratic method of submitting compromises to the European Parliament negotiated in informal trialogues between the Council , the Commission and <unk w="members"/> of the European Parliament , which are based solely <unk w="on"/> compromises reached in a single parliamentary committee .

In fact , by dispensing with <unk w="a"/> democratic debate during a first reading , not only is every Member 's right to make amendments removed but this <unk w="also"/> produces European legislation which is conceived in defiance of any democratic transparency .

In addition , the legislation finally adopted is <unk w="in"/> many ways excessive , bureaucratic and counter-productive .

Madam President , I consider the <unk w="annual"/> reports on pesticides and plant protection products to be the best we could achieve , as well as realistic and fruitful , and that is why I gave them my support .

Although at the last moment in plenary some Members tabled amendments that they thought would have ensured that the legislation was founded on stronger scientific evidence , at the same time <unk w=","/> the possibility of derogations for individual Member States , it was clear to the majority that it would be audacious to start disregarding the outcome of negotiations between Parliament and the Council , even if the amendments were valid .

It was the report on <unk w="the"/> placing of plant protection <unk w="and"/> on the market that particularly aroused passions . Differing national interests and approaches and the <unk w="commission"/> that was absent in the <unk w="report"/> were reflected in the mood of Parliament .

The debate was a heated one within our <unk w="group"/> too .

Nevertheless , the feedback from stakeholders in the sector shows that the legislation is consistent and will enable the realisation of the EU-wide targets set <unk w="for"/> them to improve and protect both <unk w="the"/> environment and public <unk w="health"/> .

It is important that <unk w="this"/> draft gives farmers in the Union the means to protect their crops .

Without this , crop <unk w="which"/> will fall off markedly and there <unk w="will"/> also be a <unk w="real"/> impact on livestock production .

Entire agricultural sectors could be condemned in France and in <unk w="particular"/> and the very role of <unk w="women"/> , which is to feed our citizens with healthy and varied produce , would be threatened .

Without questioning the need to protect consumers and users , the new regulation must not threaten innovation or <unk w="the"/> diversity of chemical families .

This is the only solution to avoid the <unk w="problem"/> of a large amount of agricultural production and the jobs and wealth that go with it .

Faced with these crucial challenges for farmers , as the producers of vegetables , fruit and cereals , we need to remain vigilant in <unk w="the"/> face of the current reforms and the measures taken to apply them at national level .

I voted <unk w="in"/> favour of both the compromises reached in the difficult trialogue negotiations between <unk w="parliament"/> , the Council and the Commission .

I <unk w="would"/> , of course , satisfied that account has been taken of my resolution adopted in November , so that particular care must be taken when licensing pesticides which are toxic for bees to ensure that pesticides which are proven to harm bees are not licensed .

I still of course have concerns about the actual effects of the regulation on agriculture , viniculture and horticulture in terms <unk w="of"/> their <unk w="relationship"/> with pesticides and the prices of them and we are still in the dark as to the effects on the industrial sectors affected .

Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of <unk w="the"/> report presented by Mrs Klaß on the framework directive for the sustainable use of pesticides .

I am fully in agreement with the adoption <unk w="of"/> the European Parliament and Council directive .

The aim of the directive is to reduce the impact of pesticides on human health and the environment : a quantitative reduction in pesticide use should therefore <unk w="be"/> one of the practical <unk w="results"/> , to be achieved by specifically setting targets and implementing national action plans .

Controls must also be much more restrictive in order to <unk w="protect"/> <unk w="their"/> public health .

Yesterday I mentioned during <unk w="the"/> debate that I consider the present compromise to be an honourable one and that the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance in the European Parliament will be endorsing it .

I wish to stress , however , that , in order to reach agreement with the <unk w="industrial"/> lobby and the pesticides industry , we had to make a few concessions .

I still regret the fact that we dropped the <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> % objective .

It is perfectly possible for Member States not <unk w="to"/> be too ambitious , which can lead to too much reserve .

In addition , the result <unk w="is"/> in relation to the establishment of buffer zones adjacent to waterways has been moderated .

This , too , <unk w="is"/> now being <unk w="up"/> to the Member States .

A European minimum distance would have <unk w="been"/> preferable from an environmental and public <unk w="health"/> <unk w="points"/> of view .

What is positive , <unk w="however"/> , is that public places frequented by vulnerable groups ( parks , sports and recreational <unk w="training"/> , schools and suchlike ) will be better protected .

This area had <unk w="not"/> received attention in Flanders and is now set to receive attention from all the governments of Europe .

in writing . - This legislation has the EU written all over it - a <unk w="particular"/> case of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut .

Undoubtedly , our hard-pressed <unk w="we"/> will be faced with yet more bureaucratic headaches .

The Commission has failed to carry out a sufficiently comprehensive and up-to-date <unk w=","/> assessment study .

in writing . - ( <unk w="sv"/> ) We have today voted in favour of Mrs Breyer 's report on the placing of plant protection products on the market .

Since its first reading in the European Parliament , analyses have shown there to be a risk of the regulation being extremely far-reaching and inflexible , and it may make the commercial-scale cultivation of common <unk w="sense"/> ( <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and onions , for example ) impossible in Sweden .

The situation is not improved by the fact <unk w="that"/> the impact assessments of the rules differ in respect of important <unk w="principles"/> , for example between those of the Swedish Chemicals Inspectorate <unk w="and"/> its British equivalent , the Pesticides Safety Directorate .

We regret the fact that in this second reading in Parliament there has been <unk w="an"/> opportunity to vote for clarification of this , but we would point out , at <unk w="the"/> <unk w="same"/> time , that the adopted <unk w="report"/> contains improvements on that from Parliament 's first reading .

We would have <unk w="liked"/> to have seen the agreement reached between the European Parliament and the <unk w="commission"/> taken into account , which would have the effect <unk w="of"/> clarifying the regulation so that dangerous use would be more clearly prohibited while plant protection that is necessary , responsible and safe - which is now at risk <unk w="of"/> being prohibited - would continue to be permitted .

This <unk w="is"/> particularly <unk w="important"/> in countries <unk w="such"/> as Portugal , which is seriously affected by certain insect pests on fruit and vegetable crops , potatoes and olives and by certain diseases such as pinewood nematode and chestnut blight , and where , not least due to <unk w="the"/> lack of effective plant protection campaigns , these pests and diseases are causing serious <unk w="damage"/> , particularly to family-based holdings .

Although <unk w="i"/> have many doubts about certain specific aspects of the compromise , such as the issues of non-chemical methods of control or prevention , and of pest and crop management , we <unk w="think"/> it is correct to apply the principle of mutual recognition of plant <unk w="and"/> product authorisations and <unk w="the"/> creation of zones encompassing regions with similar soil and climate characteristics .

However , we insist on the need for studies <unk w="to"/> give us a true picture of the consequences of these measures on productivity and , as a result , on farmers ' incomes , so that this cost can be shared by the whole of society , given that we are talking about environmental and food safety <unk w="standards"/> .

<unk w="there"/> has been a degree of unnecessary scaremongering in Britain about this report meaning ' the end of conventional agriculture as we know it ' .

This is <unk w="why"/> the position taken by farmers in <unk w="the"/> Member States .

Nevertheless , <unk w="its"/> real impact is unclear with the <unk w="need"/> to provide a satisfactory impact assessment on the proposal in its current form .

I therefore <unk w="welcome"/> the idea of a derogation post 2015 when current authorisations lapse <unk w="in"/> the event of any Member State having serious concerns <unk w="about"/> the availability of a pesticide having serious effects on crop yields .

I agree with the report adopted , particularly because the application of the principle of mutual recognition of plant protection product authorisations will end the competitive imbalances that exist between different Member States ( with different sizes <unk w="("/> market ) and <unk w="to"/> especially reduce environmental and food safety concerns .

The problem with endocrine disrupting substances is <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , <unk w="whether"/> carcinogens or mutagens , they do not have <unk w="any"/> parameters , but produce a variety of effects <unk w="resulting"/> from minor hormone imbalances to genital malformations and / or cancer .

It is important <unk w="to"/> regulate substances which <unk w="have"/> a proven adverse effect on human health .

That pesticides which are hugely harmful to health can finally be banned is progress , although there is still far too <unk w="many"/> research here .

The extent to <unk w="which"/> documentation and <unk w="what"/> are really effective is open to doubt .

The <unk w="political"/> scandals in recent years show quite clearly how easy <unk w="to"/> fraud is .

<unk w="these"/> recommendations are not <unk w="focused"/> on sound science , but more on emotional fears about the causes for the alarming worldwide disappearance of honey-bees and on fears about human health ;

Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of the report presented by Mrs Breyer <unk w="on"/> the placing of plant protection products on the market .

I <unk w="agree"/> with the purposes and goals , which are to ensure a high level of protection for human <unk w="beings"/> and the environment .

The European Union has always placed particular emphasis on topics relating to the environment and this regulation is another <unk w="step"/> designed to achieve this aim .

I am also convinced that it is right to provide for experiments on animals to be kept to a minimum and carried out only in the event of absolute need <unk w=","/> for the use of alternative methods to be promoted so that animals are spared needless suffering .

in writing . - I have decided to vote against <unk w="this"/> report for two reasons .

Firstly , we need to give our farmers the tools they <unk w="can"/> to do their job and this proposal will limit their ability greatly , especially for those farmers who work in damper and wetter climates and need to use pesticides <unk w="to"/> protect crops and their livelihood .

Yesterday I mentioned during the debate that I consider the present compromise to be an honourable one <unk w="and"/> that the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance <unk w="and"/> the European Parliament will be endorsing it .

I wish to stress , however , that , <unk w="in"/> order to reach agreement with the farming lobby and the pesticides industry , we <unk w="need"/> to make a few concessions .

Whichever <unk w="if"/> you look at it , what was achieved in terms of the cut-off criteria is a watered-down result when compared to the EP 's position at first reading .

<unk w="the"/> idea of three zones across such a vast expanse strikes <unk w=","/> <unk w="is"/> problematic because the environmental circumstances within any <unk w="of"/> those zones can vary <unk w="greatly"/> .

What is positive , <unk w="however"/> , is that the legal basis is founded on agriculture , <unk w="the"/> internal market and public health , with the concern for public health being given top priority <unk w="for"/> <unk w="the"/> relevant recitals and in Article 1 .

Equally , the cut-off criteria for substances that have <unk w="disastrous"/> effects on bees are a welcome addition .

Whilst the outcome could have been better , we voted on an <unk w="acceptable"/> compromise .

in writing . - The continued lack of a <unk w="environmental"/> impact assessment means that the EPLP is unable to support the <unk w="overall"/> package negotiated between the Council and the <unk w="european"/> Parliament rapporteur , as there is no clear indication of its impact on food production .

Labour MEPs do wish to see better and safer pesticides , but we also <unk w="have"/> a responsibility to both producers and consumers to be sure what the eventual effects of the current proposals on agricultural production and food prices would be .

Whilst the deal certainly would not have <unk w="the"/> catastrophic effects that have been predicted in certain quarters , the uncertainty involved <unk w="are"/> great enough for the EPLP to be unable to support the compromise package .

in writing . - <unk w="but"/> we have abstained from the vote on this plant protection legislation .

The emphasis of this <unk w="report"/> <unk w="focus"/> clearly on health <unk w="and"/> the links between chemical substances and cancer .

While this package seeks to limit the availability of carcinogens , Member States may allow substances <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="country"/> where there is a serious threat to <unk w="public"/> health .

The proposal seeks to <unk w="protect"/> bees and reduce red tape for substance authorisation .

<unk w="following"/> a gradual withdrawal of substances until 2016 , we would urge industry to come up with biologically sound and effective products .

In addition , the definition of " endocrine disruptor ” has not been agreed at scientific level and we <unk w="have"/> tabled amendments to <unk w="clarify"/> the opinion of Commission experts to address this .

With this text limiting the <unk w="production"/> and sale <unk w="of"/> pesticides , and the accompanying text setting out the framework for their use , <unk w="which"/> has finally achieved exemplary standards for pesticides .

Whilst allowing low-risk products onto the <unk w="market"/> , it bans <unk w="these"/> substances deemed to be very harmful .

If we are <unk w="to"/> hope eventually for rational agriculture around the world , we must welcome this advance by the European Union .

However , with these texts , the EU will have the most rigorous <unk w="approach"/> in the fight against toxic pesticides .

These are formed of collective investment schemes , which , having obtained an <unk w="agreement"/> in a Member State , are able to use this ' passport ' <unk w="in"/> the Union without the need for further examination .

In these times of generalised financial insecurity , the regulation of financial dealings must <unk w="be"/> <unk w="transparent"/> and consistently applied to bolster confidence in the sector .

Wolf Klinz 's report proposes the introduction of ' passports ' for management companies ( MC ) which are engaged <unk w="in"/> UCITS fund promoters .

This proposal allows <unk w="for"/> the cross-border management of funds <unk w="from"/> the current requisite for fully functioning management companies being set up .

It is <unk w="clear"/> that sufficient fund managers are available to maintain a proper watch on MC passports .

Mr Klinz has presented a compromise document that I <unk w="fully"/> support .

The UCITS framework Directive , to which the Klinz report refers , ensures cost <unk w="discipline"/> - and something which is particularly important at a time of economic and financial crisis in <unk w="the"/> EU - a high degree of investor protection .

There is <unk w="therefore"/> a need to review the UCITS package , adapt it to investor needs and ensure the competitiveness of the EU fund industry .

The changes <unk w="proposed"/> by the rapporteur are primarily the introduction of new provisions concerning fund mergers ( so that they will be treated as domestic mergers and will retain tax-neutrality ) , the introduction of a document which <unk w="the"/> key investor information ( replacing the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> prospectus ) and simplification of the existing notification procedure by using direct regulator-to-regulator information exchange .

in writing . - ( SV ) We support the report , as we believe that sustainable public <unk w="transport"/> are very important .

However , we object to the wording in paragraph 8 , which states that a gradual and sharp reduction in the tax burden on mid to low-level salaries and pensions must be introduced , with tax deductions , revised tax rates and <unk w="measures"/> for fiscal drag .

We believe that these <unk w="are"/> matters that should not be dealt with at EU level , but are issues that the Member States should decide on themselves .

The report on public finances in the Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) adopts the anti-labour decisions made by the Council and the Commission which are designed to strengthen the competitiveness of monopolies in order <unk w="to"/> safeguard the profits of capital and shift the burden of the deep capitalist crisis onto the workers ' shoulders .

The anti-grassroots framework shaped by the <unk w="union"/> with the Stability Pact and the <unk w="pre-accession"/> Strategy for the Member States , especially those in the EMU , in order to exercise financial policy is being strengthened .

The European Parliament , like the Commission , is trying to contain the centrifugal trends and the logic of ' <unk w="a"/> man for himself ' by calling for even greater dedication to completing the internal market , harmonising taxes <unk w="and"/> strengthening competition and the rules of the market .

Criticism of the fact that the huge sums made available <unk w="to"/> deal with the crisis are not reaching small and medium-sized <unk w="enterprises"/> , let <unk w="them"/> the workers , is misleading .

The outdated and failed models of state intervention to cover the shortcomings of the market are wishful thinking and an attempt to disorientate the workers by <unk w="the"/> social consent to a rotten system .

The only solution is for the workers to fight for grassroots power and a grassroots economy to overturn <unk w="their"/> <unk w="market"/> .

It is actually quite interesting that <unk w="this"/> report recognises <unk w="that"/> the analysis of the public financial situation in 2007 and the first part of 2008 ' clearly shows a change in the economic trend and the looming prospect of a slowdown in the economy and growth , coupled with a continued lower rate of inflation and increasing income disparities ' .

However , to tackle the crisis , it then fundamentally sets out the same <unk w="criteria"/> that led <unk w="to"/> the current situation , <unk w="and"/> of taking advantage of this opportunity to propose changes to the neoliberal and monetarist policies that <unk w="have"/> contributed to the current serious social situation of increasing inequality , unemployment , precarious and poorly <unk w="at"/> work , <unk w="and"/> poverty .

It therefore insists <unk w="on"/> price stability and the Stability and Growth Pact , albeit with a degree of flexibility , and on the Lisbon Strategy , which , as we know , has been used as a pretext in order to pursue privatisation and remove responsibility for social functions from the state .

This approach also involves the idea of the minimal state and the greater efficiency of the private <unk w="sector"/> , with the aim of imposing acceptance of so-called wage restraint , which actually results in a loss of purchasing power for wages .

What I take from Mrs Gottardi 's report on public finances is that <unk w="turkey"/> has learned no lessons from the world crisis .

Mrs Gottardi qualifies as ' market failure ' and ' insufficient supervision ' what is in reality the failure of a system which , for years , has been imposed <unk w="on"/> us : that of deregulation , of extreme world-wide free market philosophy , of absurd financialisation of the economy , where <unk w="the"/> market rules and is supposedly self-regulating .

We need to call <unk w="on"/> <unk w="all"/> the <unk w="european"/> dogmas to which we are <unk w="not"/> subject .

It has also shown that the Nation-State <unk w="is"/> <unk w="an"/> appropriate and effective level for decision , action and reaction , even if Mr Sarkozy felt he had to be <unk w="borne"/> everywhere by Mr Barroso to make people believe that the European Union was useful in this situation .

<unk w="as"/> I <unk w="abstained"/> in the vote because of the report 's adherence to the flawed Lisbon Strategy , emphasis on competitiveness , support for flexicurity and the implicit threat to pension schemes , public health <unk w="and"/> long-term care under the guise of ' structural reform ' .

The <unk w="next"/> item is the report by Mr Coelho , on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , on the proposal for a regulation of <unk w="the"/> European Parliament and of the Council amending <unk w="council"/> Regulation ( EC ) No 2252 / 2004 on standards for security features and biometrics in passports and travel documents issued by Member States - C6-0359 / <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> - .

<unk w="mr"/> President , Mr Barrot , ladies and gentlemen , the proposal we are discussing today <unk w="is"/> aimed at changing the regulations approved in 2004 , which improved and harmonised the security regulations relating to the protection of EU <unk w="citizens"/> ' passports and travel documents <unk w="or"/> fraudulent <unk w="but"/> , at the same <unk w="time"/> as it <unk w="has"/> elements of biometric identification .

I want to thank the French Presidency and Commissioner Barrot for the enormous commitment they have made in this case with a view to reaching agreement <unk w="at"/> first reading .

This solution was necessary , if we bear in mind that this regulation came into force in 2004 , and as from June this year at the latest , all the Member States would <unk w="like"/> to collect the fingerprints of children from birth .

<unk w="secondly"/> , according to the existing studies resulting from pilot projects conducted in several Member States , it is very difficult to take or even <unk w="take"/> on fingerprints of children under six years of age .

It is true that <unk w="the"/> national legislature could <unk w="prevent"/> derogations from this obligation .

However , <unk w="this"/> would mean that up to the age limit for which <unk w="the"/> exemption was granted only temporary passports could be issued .

It would <unk w="be"/> an excessive burden for parents to have to obtain a passport for each of their children whenever they wanted to travel outside the Schengen area .

<unk w="we"/> therefore succeeded in reaching an agreement stipulating a period of four years during <unk w="which"/> the age limit will be set at 12 years , with an escape clause which should allow those States which have already adopted legislation enshrining a lower limit to apply this , provided that limit is not lower than six years .

A revision clause was also expected , taking into account the <unk w="impact"/> of the study which we requested the Commission to carry <unk w="out"/> <unk w="improving"/> the credibility of children 's fingerprints , stipulating that the age limit will be definitively set and harmonised for all the <unk w="member"/> States in four years ' time .

A second derogation was introduced relating <unk w="to"/> persons who , for various reasons , are physically unable to provide fingerprints .

The International Civil Aviation Organization 's ' <unk w="the"/> person-one passport ' recommendation was also accepted .

As <unk w="regards"/> <unk w="of"/> Data Protection Supervisor said , it is a further benefit in the fight against child trafficking .

I must confess that we are struggling with the issue of the Union 's reduced competence in this matter : the issuing of passports is a national prerogative and the European Union can only intervene with regard to the reinforcement of biometric data in passports and travel documents , with the aim of improving <unk w="the"/> security of those documents within the framework of border control .

I have to say that we have established rules that safeguard the exercise of the Community competence , <unk w="of"/> which types of data will <unk w="be"/> included - fingerprints and photographs - and also the limits on the use that will be made of them .

They may only be used for the purposes provided for in <unk w="the"/> regulation - border control - and to <unk w="support"/> the authenticity of the document and ascertain whether whoever carries it is <unk w="and"/> is not its legitimate bearer .

We also reached agreement on two studies : one on <unk w="the"/> so-called ' breeder documents ' , to guarantee that the documents which enable passports to be issued deserve the same trust as the passport we want to safeguard , and another on data matching in border controls , in order to be able to <unk w="give"/> the false rejection rates .

As a result of these studies , and bearing in mind the four-year revision clause , at some point <unk w="the"/> necessary changes should be introduced through a codecision procedure , without forgetting that it is important to consult the European Data Protection Supervisor , a rule which was unfortunately not taken into account when drafting this proposal .

Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I firstly wish to thank the chairman of the Committee on Civil <unk w="society"/> , <unk w="justice"/> and Home Affairs .

I also wish to warmly thank the rapporteur , Carlos Coelho , for his remarkable report and also for the excellent cooperation maintained with the Commission on a delicate and <unk w="sensitive"/> issue .

In addition , the Commission wanted to protect children from human trafficking by making <unk w="an"/> internationally recognised principle of ' one person-one passport ' legally binding .

I <unk w="welcome"/> the European Parliament 's efforts to achieve an agreement on this proposal <unk w="at"/> first reading on the inclusion of fingerprints in passports issued by Member States <unk w="on"/> 28 June 2009 at the latest .

Had an agreement not been found , everyone would have been obliged to provide fingerprints , including the new-born , whenever they travelled <unk w=","/> with a passport .

Now the Commission will set about the task of the <unk w="commission"/> requested and required by the European Parliament as <unk w="soon"/> as <unk w="possible"/> .

on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Mr President , I <unk w="am"/> happy to support <unk w="the"/> proposals presented today .

I believe there is an urgent need to create a common set of standards for <unk w="the"/> verification of biometric data .

Colleagues <unk w="may"/> not be aware that at present there are wide discrepancies between countries as to how rigorously , for example , <unk w="to"/> verify passport <unk w="costs"/> .

Many countries require that the citizen applying <unk w="such"/> a passport actually present him or herself in person , <unk w="together"/> with their documents and photographs , and in these cases the officials at the passport-issuing office can see if that person bears a resemblance to the photo presented .

However , in some countries - maybe most notably in the United Kingdom - applications by post are the norm , and the authenticity of the photo is only confirmed by a so-called ' professional person ' who has known the applicant for at least <unk w="three"/> years .

This verification can be made by your optician or your dentist , but also by a professional photographer or a fire service official - <unk w="and"/> disrespect to members of these professions .

It <unk w="is"/> also interesting that fairly lax rules on verification exist in the United States .

<unk w="out"/> of photos for passports for first-time applicants can be carried out at so-called ' acceptable facilities ' .

So , in order to make passports secure , we really need to bring in much <unk w="more"/> reliable biometric data , namely fingerprints .

We also need to ensure <unk w="that"/> the agency responsible for their collection and verification complies with the same standards , not only <unk w="within"/> the EU but also in those nations whose citizens do enjoy visa-free travel to Europe , to assure us that they too are meeting the same stringent requirements as are our citizens here in Europe .

Mr President , when the regulation on <unk w="the"/> features <unk w=","/> the inclusion of biometric details in European passports was <unk w="adopted"/> in 2004 , the Member States did not envisage any derogation from the obligation to provide fingerprints .

Current experience shows that the existing technology still does not <unk w="mean"/> that the fingerprints of children under the <unk w="age"/> of 12 <unk w="is"/> reliable enough <unk w="to"/> allow them to be used as a security feature in passports .

I therefore welcome the compromise found with the Member States to set 12 as the age limit for the collection <unk w="of"/> biometric data , and which includes a clause <unk w="for"/> revision in three years .

The <unk w="purpose"/> of this type of data would only be <unk w="possible"/> if it truly offered protection to our children .

We remain , however , open to any positive changes in the technology <unk w="in"/> this field .

Our priority is to ensure the safety of children travelling alone to avoid <unk w="conflict"/> and trafficking of children .

<unk w="the"/> inclusion of this data in passports gives a false sense of security as <unk w="it"/> does not prevent a child from crossing a border without parental consent .

The compromise found with the <unk w="member"/> States will allow the Commission to present a report on the requirements for minors travelling alone across external borders .

Finally , the biometric data in passports must only be used to verify the authenticity of the document and the use <unk w="of"/> <unk w="a"/> personal <unk w="data"/> such as biometric details is only acceptable in conjunction with strict <unk w="legal"/> protection rules .

Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , firstly I wish to congratulate our rapporteur , Carlos Coelho , and the former French Presidency which , as expected , is not with us , for bringing about <unk w="an"/> agreement at first reading .

I have a special word of congratulation for Mr Coelho , our rapporteur , because his explanatory statement , which I invite <unk w="my"/> colleagues to read , is a little gem of intelligence and political skill .

Proper analysis of the text before us will reveal a major principle , which is also this report 's revolutionary <unk w="debate"/> .

This revolutionary <unk w="debate"/> has nothing to do with biometric data .

This raises the issue of children , and the age at which children 's <unk w="lives"/> can be taken .

Some , like Mr Coelho at <unk w="the"/> outset , wanted this <unk w="to"/> be at the earliest possible age , to give children the earliest possible protection .

Yet this would require reliable biometric data , which at the <unk w="moment"/> cannot be guaranteed .

Finally , the following compromise <unk w="has"/> been achieved : children 's fingerprints are obligatory from <unk w="the"/> age of 12 .

Those States that collect them earlier may continue to do so for four years , but in no case will the age limit be less than six and the Commission will , in coming years , report on an assessment of the system as it is operating and , if <unk w="necessary"/> be , and this is included in the <unk w="report"/> , any modifications .

We must therefore hope for major progress in the technology , <unk w="be"/> the ideal for child protection <unk w="must"/> be to have reliable , comparable biometric data as soon as possible .

With this in mind , we can register our agreement with this text , which I again <unk w="recall"/> , and I congratulate the rapporteur , the Commission for its initial proposal and the Council for its sense of compromise .

As the rapporteur for the EU strategy on the rights of the child , it falls to me to stress certain important points in Mr <unk w="galeote"/> 's report , even though other fellow Members have already done so .

Firstly , the principle of guaranteeing a common <unk w="approach"/> to regulations protecting children who cross our external borders is very welcome .

Secondly , the principle of ' one <unk w="'"/> passport ' is important , because it directly links the biometric data to the document holder .

This does away <unk w="with"/> all the procedures currently in use that allow for children to be added to their parents ' passports .

This practice makes it much more difficult and unreliable to check the identity of the child , making it <unk w="possible"/> to snatch children involved in disputes and also to trade and exploit children .

Thirdly , <unk w="the"/> report also envisages that the Commission <unk w="will"/> submit a report examining the technical feasibility of using fingerprints for the purposes of identifying children under the age of 12 .

It is very important to work <unk w="to"/> improve the system <unk w="to"/> ensure <unk w="that"/> reliability , particularly for child protection .

Although we all have different political <unk w="prisoners"/> , he did his best in order to achieve a compromise .

The Verts / ALE Group strongly opposes the <unk w="overall"/> introduction of biometrics until its necessity is proven beyond a reasonable doubt .

Therefore , we are satisfied that the compromise with <unk w="the"/> Commission and <unk w="the"/> Council is achieved , the age limit of 12 years is established for <unk w="the"/> Member States where fingerprinting of children does not take place and the <unk w="time"/> limit of <unk w="ten"/> years is established for other Member States .

We strongly believe that biometrics in passports can be used <unk w=","/> for verifying the authenticity of the document <unk w="on"/> the identity of the holder .

We cannot agree that everyone holding the European passport is a <unk w="country"/> suspect whose fingerprints are to be stored .

That is our position , but I would <unk w="like"/> to stress once more than we congratulate Mr Coelho and the Commission and Council on this compromise .

Children must be <unk w="removed"/> from the requirements to provide biometric fingerprints for passports .

It is therefore right to create an exemption here <unk w="for"/> children .

There is still no secure knowledge about the use of biometric fingerprints from children under the age <unk w="of"/> 12 .

If we were simply to use these data , we might achieve the opposite of what we are trying <unk w="to"/> do , namely less instead of more security .

The compromise which has now been <unk w="reached"/> with the Council reflects these concerns and , thanks to Parliament 's insistence and thanks to the excellent work by the rapporteur , it is based on an age limit of 12 for a transitional period of four years , during which time a broad study will be <unk w="carried"/> out in order to investigate the reliability of children 's biometric data .

Unfortunately , the compromise also provides for exemptions for those Member States which <unk w="still"/> have laws allowing fingerprints to be taken from children under the age of 12 .

It is therefore even more important that we expressly establish during the course of the compromise reached that the European legal act on security <unk w="and"/> <unk w="the"/> biometric data in passports and travel documents cannot under any circumstances be used as grounds for appeal in order to set up databases containing these data at national level .

on behalf <unk w="of"/> the IND / DEM Group . - Mr President , I am very pleased to say that the UK is excluded from this regulation because it is not part of the Schengen zone .

However , the British Government has said that it will keep in step with the regulation to ensure that <unk w="these"/> documents are not perceived as second class .

This implies that it <unk w="and"/> the proposals are first class and then it will be bound by the substance of the regulation anyway .

What kind of originating <unk w="we"/> are used for the initial <unk w="part"/> of the applicant , and how can it be sure <unk w="that"/> <unk w="they"/> are authentic ?

The report acknowledges that there should be highly secure storage mediums for keeping such information , but we all know from experience in Britain that there is no such thing as a highly secure medium for storing such <unk w="time"/> .

Personal and highly sensitive information for literally millions of people has been lost or disclosed from government databases over <unk w="the"/> last few years .

In fact the <unk w="european"/> Passport Service 's biometrics enrolment trial in 2004 showed a failure rate of 1 in 3 for facial recognition , 1 in 5 <unk w=","/> fingerprints <unk w="of"/> 1 in <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> for iris scans .

<unk w="this"/> identification is an attractive idea , but it is not the fail-safe mechanism we all might imagine .

The <unk w="national"/> Independence Party will therefore be voting against this report .

( NL ) Mr President , in my opinion the rapporteur is quite right to draw attention to a number of points which largely arise from the fact that the collection , processing and comparison of biometric passport data <unk w="in"/> relatively recent developments .

<unk w="however"/> , it would also be sensible <unk w="to"/> review the <unk w="authorisation"/> procedure , as suggested , in three years ' time .

It is also of the utmost importance that we introduce a degree of harmonisation <unk w="as"/> regards the <unk w="protection"/> of biometric data , because a chain is no stronger than its weakest link .

In theory , the <unk w="abolition"/> of internal borders in the European Union should have resulted in improved supervision of external borders , <unk w="but"/> in reality it is apparent that the system continues to exhibit quite glaring vulnerable spots .

If we want a more efficient border supervision system , it is , in any case , high time that biometric data constituted <unk w="an"/> effective part of that system .

( NL ) Mr President , I too would like to thank the rapporteur , my colleague , Mr Coelho , for <unk w="their"/> contribution .

He has already succeeded in achieving a <unk w="dialogue"/> with the Council and the Commission at first reading and I strongly support that compromise , including the ' one person-one passport ' principle .

However , I would like <unk w="to"/> explore this issue in a little <unk w="more"/> detail .

This principle should make <unk w="it"/> possible to offer greater protection against crimes such as child trafficking and child abduction , because every child should receive <unk w="his"/> or her own passport with a chip containing his or her biometric data .

In the Netherlands , the maximum cost of a passport <unk w="is"/> <unk w="upwards"/> of EUR 48 and the cost of including a child on his or her parent 's passport is EUR 8.50 .

Of course , every parent would happily hand over that amount if it contributed to their child <unk w="'s"/> safety .

Yet is it not true that , if it is possible to abduct a child , it is also <unk w="possible"/> to get hold of his or her passport ?

Once <unk w="the"/> amended regulation is in place , it will no longer be possible to include children on their parents ' passports .

However , is it not <unk w="the"/> case that including a child on his or her parent 's passport <unk w="in"/> some cases actually serves the very interest of the child 's safety , as it indicates <unk w="which"/> parent has custody of the child ?

How will it then <unk w="be"/> possible to carry out effective checks of parental authority ?

Within the next three years the European Commission will have to <unk w="review"/> the need for an additional regulation , for example Community <unk w="rules"/> concerning the crossing of borders by children .
