<unk w="it"/> is important <unk w="for"/> me to take advantage of the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> anniversary of this key event <unk w="at"/> European <unk w="union"/> to pay homage , in my turn , to those men who created the euro , such as <unk w="the"/> Werner , <unk w="the"/> Kohl , François <unk w="example"/> , Jacques <unk w="delors"/> , Valéry Giscard d <unk w="'"/> and others .

I would like , <unk w="once"/> again , to applaud their vision , their determination and their unfailing commitment <unk w="to"/> Europe .

Those I have mentioned , and many others who <unk w="mentioned"/> them , could not have imagined the rapid success of their <unk w="european"/> project .

Since 1 January of <unk w="the"/> year , 16 <unk w="member"/> States have been participating in the Economic and Monetary Union and the euro is the currency of almost 330 <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> European citizens .

The euro , then , <unk w="has"/> become the <unk w="only"/> tangible <unk w="objective"/> of <unk w="european"/> integration .

As a tangible sign <unk w="of"/> around the world , the <unk w="eu"/> is a measure of stability .

It is <unk w="for"/> its citizens from the <unk w="equally"/> serious consequences of <unk w="the"/> economic crisis .

After 10 years , <unk w="it"/> has to be recognised that the <unk w="euro"/> is an unquestionable success .

Now , anniversaries only have value if they are bridges to the future , as <unk w="we"/> have to recognise <unk w="and"/> , despite our collective <unk w="agreement"/> as we congratulate ourselves , the true tests for the <unk w="quality"/> and coherence of <unk w="the"/> euro area <unk w="before"/> us .

This <unk w="means"/> , 2009 , will be an extremely difficult year for <unk w="the"/> euro area economies and for European citizens and there will be many <unk w="problems"/> facing us , both internally and externally .

Internally , <unk w="the"/> area governments will have to act together to contain the effects of the economic crisis and invest in the structural bases of the economy to <unk w="make"/> a <unk w="solution"/> to the post-crisis world .

<unk w="we"/> must not <unk w="lose"/> sight of the fact that the euro , this protective screen we have built around our economies , did not just fall into <unk w="the"/> laps .

The euro area economies are better protected against negative economic developments because being <unk w="part"/> of the euro <unk w=","/> is a mark of quality <unk w="and"/> that its members have a real capacity for implementing prudent macroeconomic policies and policies <unk w="based"/> on sustained growth <unk w="and"/> prosperity for its citizens .

The protection afforded by <unk w="the"/> euro is therefore directly <unk w="linked"/> to our credibility , which rests on the <unk w="need"/> to <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> such policies .

<unk w="this"/> credibility is the foundation of the <unk w="process"/> of <unk w="economic"/> and Monetary Union and <unk w="we"/> must maintain it <unk w="to"/> continue fully to <unk w="benefit"/> from the benefits of the single currency .

<unk w="however"/> , we have to learn the political <unk w="will"/> from the international financial and economic <unk w="situation"/> .

There is a direct causal link <unk w="between"/> the current crisis , with its origins in the United States , and <unk w="the"/> persistence of major world imbalances .

<unk w="the"/> lack <unk w="of"/> sufficient transparency , responsibility and integrity in the <unk w="audiovisual"/> sector therefore acted <unk w="as"/> a catalyst for the crisis .

The re-establishment of stability in <unk w="the"/> financial and the real economy on a world scale implies a profound <unk w="review"/> of <unk w="the"/> financial system <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="framework"/> of the major imbalances in the mix of global consumption and <unk w="energy"/> saving .

This balancing demands the active cooperation of the <unk w="european"/> economies in America , Asia and Europe .

<unk w="the"/> noticeable progress , the euro 's <unk w="bad"/> image <unk w="is"/> , too often , overly fragmented <unk w="at"/> national <unk w=","/> too <unk w="to"/> win <unk w="precedence"/> over the common <unk w="position"/> , preventing <unk w="the"/> euro area <unk w=","/> fully assuming the <unk w="primary"/> responsibility that <unk w="lead"/> to its economic <unk w="growth"/> and <unk w="in"/> achieving all of the economic benefits deriving from Economic and Monetary Union .

<unk w="economic"/> and Monetary Union is , of course , an <unk w="important"/> project , but it is , first of <unk w="all"/> , a political <unk w="solution"/> .

As a result , we must take advantage of the euro 's second decade <unk w=","/> perfect <unk w="the"/> Economic and Monetary Union by strengthening its political bodies , both internally and <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .

Mr President , Prime Minister , Chairmen of the committees , <unk w="ladies"/> and gentlemen , I am sure that I am echoing the <unk w="opinion"/> of the <unk w="vast"/> majority of <unk w="the"/> Chamber in saying that , 10 years after its launch , I , as a European , am proud of the success of the euro .

I <unk w="would"/> like to congratulate <unk w="parliament"/> on its <unk w="unwillingness"/> to commemorate the 10th anniversary of our single currency here , in this Plenary <unk w="session"/> of <unk w="the"/> European Parliament in Strasbourg .

The <unk w="political"/> and Economic <unk w="and"/> Monetary <unk w="union"/> have undeniably been a success .

Over these 10 years , the euro has brought <unk w="more"/> benefits to all its <unk w="fleets"/> and <unk w=","/> to <unk w="do"/> so <unk w=","/> amid a deep economic <unk w="and"/> financial crisis .

Within the short period of a decade , the euro <unk w="has"/> earned a well-deserved reputation <unk w="of"/> strength and stability .

The <unk w="first"/> is the second of the world <unk w="national"/> currencies and , thanks to <unk w="the"/> role in the international economy , <unk w="is"/> already comparable in some respects to the dollar as <unk w="an"/> instrument of commerce and means of payment in international finance .

Above <unk w="all"/> , <unk w="however"/> , the euro is part of the daily <unk w="lives"/> of nearly 330 million people in 16 countries of the European Union .

We all carry in <unk w="the"/> wallets this symbol of a <unk w="new"/> European identity : because the euro , as well as being a <unk w="priority"/> , <unk w="is"/> a central element of our European project , reminding <unk w="ourselves"/> in a tangible way of the benefits of <unk w="european"/> integration <unk w="and"/> that began <unk w="by"/> half a <unk w="year"/> ago .

<unk w="the"/> euro <unk w="has"/> given <unk w="very"/> low inflation and <unk w="special"/> interest <unk w="rate"/> , thanks to a macroeconomic <unk w="strategy"/> directed at stability .

The euro has provided a clear boost <unk w="to"/> trade <unk w="and"/> investment among its Member States .

The euro has also <unk w="proposed"/> the creation of 16 <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> jobs over <unk w="the"/> last 10 years <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="free-trade"/> area , three times the corresponding figure from <unk w="the"/> previous decade .

The euro has encouraged financial integration and the development of the single market ; it has protected <unk w="the"/> members of <unk w="the"/> euro area from <unk w="community"/> disruption ; and it has been and continues to be a pole of stability , <unk w="not"/> just for the European <unk w="union"/> , but also for the global economy .

<unk w="this"/> crisis <unk w="management"/> , <unk w="as"/> a <unk w="result"/> , a touchstone for the euro .

However , those who think that the Economic <unk w="and"/> Monetary <unk w="union"/> is not <unk w="prepared"/> to face <unk w="the"/> consequences of this crisis are <unk w="not"/> mistaken .

On the contrary , <unk w="if"/> the single currency did not exist , the <unk w="negative"/> effects of the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> would be <unk w="much"/> greater .

Many Member States would now be facing <unk w="an"/> volatility in their exchange rates <unk w="and"/> , <unk w="however"/> , might even be suffering speculative attacks <unk w="on"/> their currencies .

The spread of their public <unk w="health"/> securities would be <unk w="much"/> greater than currently , and their <unk w="need"/> for combating the crisis <unk w="and"/> fiscal stimuli would be narrower .

The Stability and Growth <unk w="pact"/> , <unk w="back"/> in 2005 , has encouraged governments to sort out <unk w="their"/> public accounts , leading in <unk w="according"/> to the lowest budget deficit for 25 years , which is now enabling them <unk w="to"/> face <unk w="a"/> crisis in a <unk w="difficult"/> situation .

Throughout this crisis , the <unk w="dream"/> of the European <unk w="central"/> Bank have done nothing but reinforce <unk w="the"/> solid reputation that it had <unk w="been"/> earned <unk w="in"/> the early years of Economic <unk w="and"/> Monetary Union .

<unk w="by"/> decisively adopting <unk w="the"/> necessary measures and taking the lead in <unk w="cooperation"/> with <unk w="the"/> other <unk w="central"/> banks in industrialised countries , the European Central Bank has served as our guide <unk w="for"/> this period and has substantially contributed <unk w="to"/> preventing huge financial <unk w="resources"/> .

The economic situation <unk w="is"/> not as we would have hoped as we celebrate this anniversary , <unk w="the"/> events <unk w="worth"/> highlighting more than ever the advantages of Economic and Monetary <unk w="union"/> .

For those countries which have not yet joined , <unk w="the"/> euro area is an <unk w="extremely"/> attractive <unk w="one"/> , as demonstrated last week in Bratislava when <unk w="we"/> welcomed Slovakia as the newest - the 16th - member of the <unk w="european"/> family .

The European Commission and Parliament <unk w="will"/> continue <unk w="cooperation"/> with Member States , the Eurogroup , the European Central Bank and the international community in order to place <unk w="our"/> economies <unk w="along"/> the path to the sustainable resumption of growth .

<unk w="in"/> this regard , the Commission <unk w="'s"/> recommendations in the report that we <unk w="had"/> a <unk w="few"/> months ago <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="last"/> 10 years of Economic and Monetary Union , which was recently debated in this Chamber , are as <unk w="a"/> or even more valid <unk w="as"/> than they were last spring .

Increased budgetary vigilance , its extension to other <unk w="social"/> aspects , the link between macroeconomic policies and structural <unk w="funds"/> , the external image of <unk w="the"/> euro and improved <unk w="coordination"/> of the Economic and Monetary Union are , and must continue to be , the core themes on which to base <unk w="the"/> euro <unk w="for"/> second decade , with at least <unk w="the"/> many successes <unk w="of"/> this first one .

Mr President , I <unk w="would"/> like <unk w="to"/> conclude by paying tribute to the vision and ambition of <unk w="the"/> founding <unk w="fathers"/> of the euro , <unk w="the"/> imagination and resolute action bequeathed <unk w="giving"/> us a currency of which all Europeans can be proud .

The crisis has opened up a new chapter <unk w="in"/> the global economy , in which <unk w="the"/> Economic and Monetary <unk w="union"/> must continue to play a relevant role <unk w="in"/> serving the <unk w="economic"/> interests and ambitions of <unk w="the"/> Europeans .

Mr President , Mr Juncker , Mr Trichet , ladies and gentlemen , everyone who has been involved in <unk w="adopting"/> the <unk w="european"/> currency <unk w="is"/> grateful to you , Mr President , <unk w="president-in-office"/> to you , ladies <unk w="and"/> gentlemen , for this very fine <unk w="report"/> which you have <unk w="participated"/> in commemorating <unk w="the"/> 10th <unk w="manner"/> of <unk w="the"/> birth <unk w="of"/> the euro .

I am one of those people <unk w="who"/> think that it is <unk w="important"/> to avoid <unk w="an"/> ever-increasing number of <unk w="member"/> ceremonies , <unk w="and"/> this one is justified because it marks the greatest contribution to European <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> since the election of the European <unk w="union"/> by universal suffrage in 1979 .

<unk w="we"/> have certainly come a long way and <unk w="doing"/> this pleasant , friendly <unk w="country"/> does not <unk w="cover"/> the whole picture .

I would like to pay tribute <unk w="to"/> all those who mapped out this course <unk w=","/> those who have followed it .

<unk w="we"/> can find <unk w="the"/> distant origins in the report from <unk w="the"/> Luxembourg prime minister , Pierre <unk w="rapporteur"/> , your predecessor , <unk w="in"/> 1970 .

It <unk w="is"/> , however , the monetary crisis in the years that followed and the currency flotation which triggered action in this area .

As long as the currency exchange rates were fixed , the <unk w="current"/> system did not upset our attempt to create a common market .

However , as soon as they were floating , this <unk w="parliament"/> raised its head .

After the <unk w="death"/> attempts to <unk w="build"/> a monetary <unk w="policy"/> , <unk w="a"/> strong <unk w="freedom"/> from France and <unk w="germany"/> between 1975 and 1980 led to the meeting in Bremen , in <unk w="east"/> Germany , <unk w="took"/> the decision to create the European Monetary System <unk w="to"/> introduce <unk w="new"/> ecu , the euro <unk w="has"/> precursor .

This <unk w="has"/> had the <unk w="right"/> and <unk w="commitment"/> of our partners in the Benelux <unk w="union"/> and Italy .

<unk w="over"/> a period of little activity between <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> and 1988 , the process was given new <unk w="problems"/> with <unk w="the"/> creation by <unk w="the"/> Council of the committee chaired by Jacques Delors , resulting in the <unk w="protocol"/> of the Maastricht Treaty .

<unk w="let"/> us salute the pioneers who have been involved in <unk w="them"/> along the way , as you yourself have recently , Mr President , as <unk w="well"/> as my friend , Chancellor <unk w=","/> Schmidt <unk w="in"/> his <unk w="head"/> of State , Manfred <unk w="example"/> ; Bernard Clappier , the <unk w="use"/> of the <unk w="irish"/> de France at the time and co-author of Robert <unk w="guinea"/> 's Declaration in 1950 ; Alexandre Lamfalussy , who provided <unk w="us"/> with <unk w="the"/> great , almost unique <unk w="interest"/> during the work of the committee on European monetary union which we set up with Helmut <unk w="need"/> to <unk w="assist"/> the project ; Jacques Delors , President of the European Commission , who took over ; <unk w="however"/> , last but not <unk w="least"/> , the negotiators and signatories of the Maastricht Treaty <unk w="has"/> drafted <unk w="an"/> excellent text , which has <unk w="not"/> actually been touched since then , headed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl <unk w=","/> President François Mitterrand , whose determination must <unk w="be"/> mentioned in particular , along with their <unk w="other"/> colleagues .

<unk w="but"/> we must say a big ' thank you ' to all <unk w="of"/> them .

On this occasion of the 10th anniversary , <unk w="which"/> celebrated at a time of crisis , <unk w="how"/> can we say in support of the euro ?

What fine words can we use in <unk w="european"/> anniversary toasts ?

First of <unk w="all"/> , <unk w="the"/> euro 's success has <unk w="increased"/> expectations , not only of all its opponents , <unk w="of"/> course , but even of <unk w="its"/> its supporters .

I will not <unk w="go"/> into detail as you have only given <unk w="the"/> five minutes .

During the <unk w="debate"/> which I <unk w="disagree"/> with the most <unk w="important"/> monetary <unk w="policy"/> between <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> and 2000 , they were <unk w="little"/> sceptical about <unk w="the"/> possibility of introducing the euro and making it a success .

In 10 years the <unk w="crisis"/> has become the number two currency <unk w="in"/> the world and , as has <unk w="been"/> mentioned <unk w="just"/> now , one of <unk w="the"/> most respected <unk w="here"/> .

Its sound <unk w="policy"/> has <unk w="been"/> a protective shield against the crisis and a <unk w="need"/> for non-inflationary growth .

Without the existence of <unk w="the"/> euro , mainland <unk w="farming"/> would be currently turned upside <unk w="out"/> by a monetary tornado , which would deepen the <unk w="current"/> crisis .

We are expecting the monetary policy to try to <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , within the limits <unk w="of"/> the currency 's power , <unk w="the"/> depressing impact of the <unk w="environment"/> and <unk w="will"/> pave the way for the return to non-inflationary growth , which we <unk w="are"/> not tackling yet , <unk w="at"/> which time the sizeable public deficits and <unk w="lack"/> of debt triggered by the crisis ought to have <unk w="been"/> cleared .

In this respect , <unk w="we"/> are putting our trust <unk w="in"/> the managers and staff at the European Central <unk w="bank"/> , who have demonstrated <unk w="its"/> considerable expertise since the <unk w="completion"/> of the crisis .

We must be careful not to try to give the euro a global dimension , which would flatter <unk w="be"/> vanity , but would multiply <unk w="the"/> risks we face .

The euro is Europe 's currency <unk w="and"/> must express <unk w="its"/> distinct culture , promoting a <unk w="modern"/> and <unk w="cooperative"/> model among the world <unk w="and"/> other currencies .

Finally , I <unk w="do"/> not <unk w="forget"/> that the general public will need to <unk w="be"/> too long for banking regulation to be restored in <unk w="the"/> euro area .

It seems to <unk w="me"/> that we could call on <unk w="the"/> European Central Bank to carry out this process <unk w="in"/> restoring order and supervise <unk w="its"/> implementation , according to Article 106 ( 5 ) of the <unk w="ec"/> Treaty .

Indeed , we need a strong impetus , expertise <unk w="and"/> a decision timetable which the European Central Bank could draw up and which the <unk w="council"/> of Ministers for the euro <unk w="zone"/> , presided by your good self , Mr Juncker , could then adopt and implement .

I will conclude , <unk w="mr"/> President , <unk w="by"/> saying that <unk w="this"/> symbol of integration represented by the euro 's <unk w="republic"/> must <unk w="give"/> us the <unk w="opportunity"/> to take the next step in creating this increasingly united Europe as recommended under the various treaties and which we are <unk w="trying"/> to achieve .

Let us <unk w="remind"/> the inevitability of failure with <unk w="the"/> energy <unk w="and"/> success .

That success today goes by the <unk w="new"/> name of the euro .

Mr <unk w="president"/> , the euro is the successful outcome <unk w="of"/> a vision and <unk w="political"/> will , and not <unk w="the"/> product of the market .

It demonstrates the best that <unk w="we"/> can achieve <unk w="by"/> everyone joins forces .

I also want , of course , on this occasion <unk w="to"/> salute and thank on our behalf , on our children 's behalf and on <unk w="everyone"/> else 's <unk w="father"/> , the founding <unk w="fathers"/> and the architects of this <unk w="city"/> : Pierre Werner , who is with us , Chancellor Helmut <unk w="schmidt"/> , <unk w="the"/> Giscard d <unk w="burg"/> , the President <unk w="of"/> the European Commission Jacques <unk w="prodi"/> , Chancellor Helmut <unk w="parliament"/> , President François <unk w="prodi"/> , <unk w="the"/> Alexandre Lamfalussy , Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa , Philippe Maystadt and everyone else whom I have not mentioned .

I would also , however , like to pay tribute to <unk w="the"/> actions of your predecessors , Mr President , the actions of my predecessors , Karl von Wogau , <unk w="who"/> is still with us , and <unk w=","/> Christa Randzio-Plath , <unk w="it"/> is <unk w="wrong"/> with us <unk w="all"/> .

The actions of <unk w="this"/> Parliament played a <unk w="major"/> role in <unk w="this"/> , <unk w="at"/> the time of the transition to the euro , we were not only concerned <unk w="with"/> the transfer of <unk w="power"/> in the banks but <unk w="also"/> about our <unk w="citizens"/> , so that they could <unk w="have"/> to , get used to and adopt <unk w="a"/> new currency which was <unk w="going"/> to be theirs .

I also believe that <unk w="the"/> action <unk w="of"/> our <unk w="eyes"/> must be recalled and given credit .

I am also <unk w="convinced"/> that this <unk w="debate"/> can take place here , <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="european"/> Parliament , the home of democracy for all Europe <unk w="'s"/> citizens .

After all , the euro is first and <unk w="then"/> the concern of us all , <unk w="and"/> then of the banks .

It is certainly the concern of <unk w="us"/> , as they <unk w="are"/> happy to tell us .

However , Europeans <unk w="will"/> have adopted the euro <unk w="with"/> a <unk w="series"/> of belonging <unk w="to"/> the European Union .

There were <unk w="all"/> of us to start with , and now there are 16 .

However , I do get the feeling that this crisis is tempting some <unk w="way"/> to reconsider <unk w="that"/> they should <unk w="go"/> to the euro area or <unk w="not"/> .

I <unk w="believe"/> that <unk w="it"/> is the best <unk w="opposite"/> of our success .

Europe makes progress , as is so often the <unk w="case"/> , by demonstrating its efficiency <unk w=","/> on this occasion <unk w="to"/> mark <unk w="the"/> 10th anniversary , we can clearly see that the assessment <unk w="of"/> the euro is largely a positive one .

Some countries which were hesitant <unk w="and"/> now <unk w=","/> on <unk w="the"/> door of the euro <unk w="externally"/> .

We can only encourage them to do <unk w="so"/> under <unk w="the"/> terms of the Treaty , which have never <unk w="been"/> revised and which are useful terms allowing Europe to progress in economic and monetary matters on the <unk w="basis"/> of the two pillars of <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and enlargement .

However , an anniversary is also a <unk w="matter"/> for looking to <unk w="the"/> future .

The euro , <unk w="which"/> has been <unk w="adopted"/> by these <unk w=","/> 10 years , must now open up new areas for development , <unk w="and"/> that we have not dealt with these at <unk w="all"/> , but <unk w="also"/> because they <unk w="can"/> still work in progress <unk w="all"/> of us .

On the subject of <unk w="horizontal"/> cooperation , <unk w="the"/> Juncker described <unk w="the"/> crisis that we <unk w="are"/> going <unk w="on"/> .

In this <unk w="way"/> crisis we all know that , <unk w="if"/> we had made progress <unk w="in"/> the Economic Union as quickly as we <unk w="have"/> in the Monetary Union , <unk w="it"/> would be <unk w="much"/> better off today .

It <unk w="is"/> not normal <unk w="for"/> us to focus on the budget deficit balances and not on <unk w="the"/> quality of <unk w="public"/> spending .

<unk w="it"/> is not normal for Member <unk w="states"/> to <unk w="arrive"/> at such different rates <unk w="of"/> interest when they <unk w="have"/> the same <unk w="problem"/> and the <unk w="interest"/> rate of interest set <unk w="by"/> the European Central Bank .

The same applies when it <unk w="comes"/> to <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> the financial markets .

President Giscard d 'Estaing mentioned Article 105 ( 6 ) , which is our common platform , allowing <unk w="us"/> to make progress .

I think that <unk w="one"/> of the lessons from <unk w="this"/> crisis is that it actually shows that the European Central Bank will need to have a supervisory role .

We do not want to disconnect <unk w="the"/> supervision of <unk w="the"/> financial <unk w="resources"/> from macroprudential <unk w="countries"/> .

However , to achieve this , we will also need , as <unk w="european"/> leaders , to <unk w="talk"/> about achieving a balance .

<unk w="will"/> the European Central <unk w="bank"/> sees its <unk w="role"/> strengthened , it will have to <unk w="be"/> indicated how <unk w="the"/> institutional balance on the <unk w="balance"/> needs to be established in the future .

I would like to <unk w="make"/> one final remark <unk w="on"/> the international role <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="commission"/> .

I agree that we must not <unk w="forget"/> the exorbitant privilege of being the reserve <unk w="bank"/> .

However , <unk w="it"/> is not normal either for us to have taken 10 <unk w="years"/> to <unk w="make"/> the euro and then , 10 years after the transition to <unk w="the"/> euro , we are <unk w="much"/> passive in the international arena <unk w=","/> the <unk w="israeli"/> voice <unk w="of"/> the euro <unk w="is"/> not being heard <unk w="more"/> clearly in the process of restoring <unk w="the"/> balance to the <unk w="european"/> monetary system .

Finally , I believe that <unk w="the"/> euro is much more than just a currency .

This <unk w="is"/> why it is a <unk w="political"/> issue <unk w="for"/> this Parliament .

<unk w="this"/> is a <unk w="step"/> at the service <unk w="of"/> our citizens who are <unk w=","/> through the deepest crisis in <unk w="colombia"/> .

We must then <unk w="do"/> this wonderful <unk w="approach"/> , this symbol <unk w="of"/> Europe <unk w="can"/> help <unk w="our"/> citizens come through this crisis in <unk w="the"/> best conditions possible .

<unk w="mr"/> President , 10 <unk w="%"/> of the <unk w="treaty"/> is indeed a reason to celebrate .

Anyone <unk w="who"/> had said <unk w="ten"/> years ago that the euro would have <unk w="been"/> as splendidly as it has done <unk w="to"/> have <unk w="been"/> laughed at .

Many people <unk w="have"/> contributed to <unk w="this"/> success , and I remember <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> sceptical <unk w="points"/> - it was <unk w="referred"/> to as a premature <unk w="combination"/> and an unviable project - and today <unk w="i"/> know that it was a vision to which <unk w="the"/> people <unk w="""/> .

The previous speaker <unk w="reminded"/> us of all those <unk w="who"/> contributed to this , of the milestones , of the European monetary system , which <unk w="is"/> an agreement with the European Central Bank to create central <unk w="banks"/> , of the Delors <unk w="union"/> , which provided for <unk w="the"/> introduction of the monetary <unk w="union"/> in <unk w="all"/> stages , <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="treaty"/> of Maastricht - <unk w="or"/> two <unk w="years"/> after the fall of the Wall - and of <unk w="the"/> transitional periods .

Many people <unk w="have"/> helped <unk w="to"/> make <unk w="the"/> euro the successful project it is today .

As the committee chairman , Mrs <unk w="karamanou"/> , has already said , during this period , in particular from 1994 when the implementation of the Treaty of Maastricht <unk w="does"/> , <unk w="leading"/> up to <unk w="us"/> , Parliament actively cooperated <unk w="with"/> the introduction <unk w="of"/> the notes and coins , and in many reports , <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , opinions and also proposals , and I would like specifically to thank <unk w="the"/> two committee chairmen <unk w="at"/> that time , Mr von Wogau <unk w=","/> Mrs <unk w="karamanou"/> , <unk w="who"/> also represented Parliament <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="third"/> world and who gave this project , although originally created <unk w="by"/> the governments , <unk w="the"/> parliamentary support it needed .

We <unk w="are"/> working <unk w="together"/> , too , under the chairmanship of Mrs Berès , <unk w="on"/> the same representation .

On 18 November Parliament adopted , <unk w="by"/> a large majority , a report in which <unk w="you"/> describe <unk w="individual"/> successes , <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , risks and problems , <unk w="and"/> I would <unk w="like"/> to mention just a <unk w="few"/> things in addition <unk w="to"/> what Mrs Berès has said .

<unk w="the"/> euro has <unk w="been"/> a <unk w="great"/> success , and it is a unique <unk w="objective"/> : a central monetary <unk w="policy"/> under the management of the European <unk w="central"/> Bank <unk w="on"/> local <unk w="communities"/> and finance policies .

It is important that , in <unk w="fact"/> , <unk w="the"/> connection between <unk w="the"/> two levels of responsibility in the Stability and Growth Pact are retained also during <unk w="times"/> of crisis .

Without this <unk w="purchase"/> and Growth <unk w="policy"/> , without stronger <unk w="reform"/> of the budgetary and finance <unk w="programmes"/> , the euro would also <unk w="in"/> future face risks that are avoidable .

In this regard , I appeal in particular to the Member States of the euro <unk w="zone"/> , <unk w="but"/> also to the whole of the European Union , to take this discipline , <unk w="through"/> coordinated cooperation , more seriously <unk w=","/> has been the case in <unk w="the"/> past in connection with certain issues .

The <unk w="commission"/> has pushed down <unk w="them"/> considerably and so created confidence and <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , and it <unk w="has"/> become the second <unk w="largest"/> commonly held <unk w="a"/> currency in a <unk w="period"/> of time that no one <unk w="makes"/> it capable of .

The euro has <unk w="increased"/> the pressure for <unk w="the"/> reform in the <unk w="member"/> States and therefore , even in the age of globalisation , has <unk w="created"/> a ' fitness programme ' for undertakings and for nations .

The institutions of the <unk w="european"/> area - several were <unk w="caused"/> by <unk w="the"/> previous <unk w="speakers"/> - <unk w="the"/> Ecofin Council , the Euro <unk w=","/> and many other <unk w="countries"/> have <unk w="created"/> the necessary conditions together with the <unk w="commission"/> and the <unk w="european"/> Central Bank , because <unk w="we"/> were already operating , because they were in place , because <unk w="they"/> worked <unk w="on"/> in order to <unk w="intervene"/> quickly , reliably and correctly in <unk w="the"/> economic crisis .

We have experienced the euro as a lever for <unk w="creating"/> a European financial market .

<unk w="the"/> political conclusion <unk w=","/> these common successes is that states with a common currency and a common internal <unk w="market"/> have <unk w="proved"/> a unique level of integration that will <unk w="bring"/> peace and prosperity .

<unk w="however"/> , we <unk w="must"/> necessarily take <unk w="the"/> euro <unk w="for"/> granted in future .

There <unk w="are"/> numerous specific requests and demands to <unk w="take"/> the risks seriously : <unk w="the"/> drifting apart <unk w="from"/> the <unk w="national"/> economies , which <unk w="are"/> associated with considerable risks in <unk w="accordance"/> with the growth of <unk w="employment"/> and <unk w="the"/> budget deficits , should <unk w="not"/> be concealed on this anniversary .

An entirely <unk w="different"/> aspect <unk w="of"/> the varying <unk w="aspects"/> of the interest rates for government bonds .

<unk w="we"/> are currently seeing <unk w="an"/> interest rate margin , which has no doubt decreased , increasing again , bringing the possibility <unk w="of"/> new problems in this regard for individual Member States within <unk w="the"/> euro <unk w="zone"/> .

I would remind <unk w="the"/> House that , particularly in connection <unk w="with"/> the expansion of the <unk w="free-trade"/> area , no special <unk w="protection"/> may <unk w="be"/> given and <unk w="that"/> all <unk w="those"/> that are <unk w="part"/> of the euro area can , <unk w="and"/> must , comply <unk w="with"/> these conditions <unk w="in"/> the Treaty of Maastricht .

It has passed <unk w="the"/> first test and has provided a unique contribution to <unk w="the"/> permanent integration of our nations in Europe .

Mr President , Mr <unk w="parish"/> d 'Estaing , Mr Juncker , Mr Trichet , Mr Almunia , ladies and <unk w="gentlemen"/> , many good points have already been <unk w="mentioned"/> .

Yet the idea <unk w="of"/> Europe could <unk w="create"/> a single currency , whose foundations were <unk w=","/> especially <unk w="for"/> the Bremen agreement on the monetary system in <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> and the <unk w="rest"/> of the ecu , would have been met <unk w="at"/> the time with scepticism from the markets <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="international"/> monetary authorities <unk w="in"/> Europe .

We should warmly thank and congratulate all those <unk w="who"/> made the decision and whose names have been mentioned here .

The creation of <unk w="the"/> euro is the best <unk w="way"/> that Europe <unk w="is"/> capable , given <unk w="the"/> political <unk w="will"/> , <unk w="to"/> take long-term decisions for a common , prosperous future .

This anniversary , then , gives <unk w="it"/> a particularly <unk w="clear"/> message of hope for today 's times .

<unk w="it"/> must be <unk w="said"/> , however , that among <unk w="our"/> fellow citizens and until <unk w=","/> there were mixed perceptions of the <unk w="commission"/> .

For those <unk w="who"/> travel , the <unk w="creation"/> of a single currency <unk w="is"/> obvious .

<unk w="all"/> those who do not , the euro was associated with price rises .

Studies have , <unk w="in"/> fact , shown that in most countries inflation was felt even though the official figures showed that , <unk w="and"/> especially to the action of the <unk w="european"/> Central Bank , monetary stability had been ensured .

The reality is that some definitely <unk w="take"/> advantage of the euro to <unk w="take"/> up some <unk w="sectors"/> and perhaps consumers were not vigilant <unk w="either"/> .

When <unk w="the"/> euro has risen against the dollar , we have <unk w="just"/> heard comments from some manufacturers who for the most part produce in <unk w="the"/> euro area <unk w="to"/> sell outside this <unk w="country"/> .

<unk w="the"/> European Central Bank has <unk w="always"/> been <unk w="on"/> its <unk w="eyes"/> , who <unk w="has"/> not called into question its independence <unk w="or"/> rather <unk w="a"/> policy on interest <unk w="issues"/> , which seemed to be too high .

We all understand that the euro is a determining factor in <unk w="which"/> the <unk w="negative"/> repercussions <unk w="of"/> a crisis <unk w="resulting"/> from the United States .

The European Central Bank <unk w="has"/> certainly been the most <unk w="important"/> central bank .

What would the <unk w="commission"/> have <unk w="been"/> if the various <unk w="member"/> States had each had to defend their <unk w="own"/> individual currency ?

Devaluations would have been inevitable and we would not have avoided a <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> crisis .

The welcome results <unk w="of"/> the euro <unk w="will"/> encourage us to continue <unk w="how"/> to broaden <unk w="the"/> coordination of economic policies and to respect the principles <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="stability"/> and <unk w="stability"/> Pact .

It is true , at present , <unk w="that"/> exceptions may and <unk w="they"/> should be accepted , but they can only be temporary and the objective of balanced public finances must be <unk w="defined"/> .

High-quality public finances and economic policies are , in fact , in the long <unk w="term"/> , more than <unk w="the"/> necessary .

They are the condition <unk w="for"/> the solidity of our currency , the euro .

Mr President , during these <unk w="years"/> of uncertainty , it is important to be able to count on something with a reliable <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> : <unk w="the"/> euro .

<unk w="so"/> I was able to play a bit-part as a member of <unk w="the"/> Ecofin <unk w="and"/> during the period of preparation <unk w="for"/> the <unk w="european"/> single <unk w="market"/> , I could <unk w="have"/> the doubts on <unk w="both"/> sides of the <unk w="mediterranean"/> and the pussyfooting of the <unk w="member"/> States , which ultimately made <unk w="barnier"/> Eurogroup into a stronger forum for cooperation ahead <unk w="of"/> its time .

<unk w="however"/> , two <unk w="of"/> Europe 's finest achievements came about through the determination of a few states <unk w="to"/> forge <unk w="ahead"/> in making integration <unk w="is"/> real for <unk w="all"/> our fellow citizens .

I am referring to the Schengen Agreement <unk w=","/> the <unk w="free"/> movement of Europeans , <unk w="which"/> was implemented on the <unk w="basis"/> of <unk w="member"/> states : France , with President Mitterrand , Germany , with Chancellor Kohl , along with the Benelux countries .

Switzerland <unk w="is"/> now <unk w="the"/> part of <unk w="the"/> Schengen area , but the British <unk w="of"/> Irish are still shying away from <unk w="the"/> people 's Europe .

President Mitterrand <unk w="and"/> Chancellor Kohl were also the political architects of the euro , even though there were many who supported this monetary success , starting with <unk w="jacques"/> Delors .

The <unk w="second"/> lesson I would like to draw from this is that anyone who wants a <unk w="new"/> Europe <unk w="will"/> not be <unk w="capable"/> of intergovernmental action , especially if <unk w="there"/> is a <unk w="result"/> of <unk w="action"/> which really want to <unk w="bring"/> Europe forward .

The <unk w="maastricht"/> Treaty , which is intended <unk w="to"/> combat <unk w="organised"/> crime , is an <unk w="example"/> of this positive enhanced cooperation for Europe .

<unk w="at"/> a time when the Constitutional Treaty <unk w="is"/> dead and buried , <unk w="on"/> the ' <unk w="people"/> ' vote from a strange coalition of political forces not only <unk w="in"/> France <unk w=","/> in <unk w="the"/> Netherlands too , and <unk w="on"/> the indigestible piece of legislation known <unk w="as"/> the ' mini ' Treaty <unk w="in"/> Lisbon is being blocked in <unk w="colombia"/> and <unk w="ineffective"/> in <unk w="the"/> Czech Republic <unk w="as"/> well , we should <unk w="remember"/> that <unk w="there"/> is still functioning <unk w="by"/> relying <unk w="on"/> the huge <unk w="impact"/> of enhanced cooperation .

<unk w="in"/> any case , the attraction of the euro remains <unk w="possible"/> .

<unk w="we"/> are <unk w="talking"/> about not being able to benefit more <unk w="from"/> the protective <unk w="measures"/> provided by <unk w="the"/> euro .

Even in the <unk w="individual"/> voices are <unk w="also"/> raised , questioning the country 's splendid isolation in the face of the pound 's collapse , which has seen its status <unk w=","/> from that of the world 's reserve currency to a run-of-the-mill currency <unk w=","/> less than a century .

Thanks to <unk w="the"/> consistent actions of Wim <unk w="immigration"/> , Jean-Claude Trichet and the <unk w="commission"/> , the <unk w="eu"/> has become <unk w="the"/> world <unk w="and"/> second reserve currency in <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> years .

Of <unk w="course"/> , the dollar <unk w="and"/> king for global transactions , still providing a safe investment , but the colossal debts accumulated by the United States in <unk w="all"/> the rest of the world to finance <unk w="the"/> lifestyle <unk w="and"/> increasingly sow the <unk w="event"/> of doubt as to the ability of the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> one economic <unk w="and"/> to honour its commitments .

In fact , the financial <unk w="perspective"/> is tending towards a euro / dollar <unk w="state"/> .

Any monetary duopoly regularly goes through parity <unk w=","/> which often occur suddenly .

In <unk w="recent"/> times of widespread recession , the world <unk w="and"/> stability <unk w="and"/> new <unk w="technologies"/> .

The <unk w="commission"/> will have a key <unk w="role"/> to play <unk w="in"/> this new <unk w="role"/> .

The European Central <unk w="bank"/> ( ECB ) has done what it needed to do <unk w="in"/> the face of a global financial crisis ' made in the USA ' .

As Jacques Delors said , the <unk w="commission"/> is the shield to <unk w="make"/> the whole <unk w="of"/> Europe , but the euro has not stimulated the European economy enough so far .

<unk w="at"/> the end of the <unk w="day"/> , the Commission is only a first-class consultant making <unk w=","/> which <unk w="are"/> generally useful , but the real <unk w="political"/> players remain the states themselves which , unfortunately , are operating in a disorganised manner .

<unk w="but"/> the effective harmonisation of the cumulative economic <unk w="organisation"/> of <unk w="member"/> states <unk w="to"/> work miracles , the Eurogroup , in spite of the commendable efforts <unk w="of"/> Jean-Claude Juncker , still <unk w="there"/> remains <unk w="an"/> informal discussion <unk w="today"/> .

In the spring <unk w="of"/> 1999 , I <unk w="was"/> able to <unk w="see"/> the attempt made <unk w="by"/> the Eurogroup by a <unk w="special"/> finance ministers , including <unk w="the"/> Lafontaine , Dominique Strauss-Kahn , <unk w="and"/> Ciampi <unk w=","/> a few <unk w="days"/> , to establish <unk w="economic"/> and monetary cooperation between the European <unk w="union"/> and the European Central <unk w="bank"/> .

Wim Duisenberg made the cutting retort : ' there never will be <unk w="any"/> ex-ante coordination with the European Central <unk w="bank"/> as you are always <unk w="going"/> to have to react ex-post to our <unk w="citizens"/> . '

The reason for <unk w="this"/> is obvious : the ECB is and will remain independent in conducting its monetary policy , <unk w="the"/> independence <unk w="does"/> not mean a ban on constructive dialogue between institutions tasked with defending the interests and common destiny <unk w="by"/> 500 million Europeans .

There is nothing to prevent states from organising themselves better with regard to <unk w="the"/> proper coordination of their <unk w="common"/> policies , <unk w="and"/> it is inside the EU or especially when representing Europe externally , as Jean-Claude Juncker so sensibly concluded <unk w="just"/> now .

Mr <unk w="president"/> , Mr Giscard d 'Estaing , Mr Juncker , Mr Trichet , <unk w="mr"/> Almunia , ladies and gentlemen , I find it very regrettable that <unk w="very"/> few Members are <unk w="present"/> today for this formal <unk w="debate"/> , <unk w="but"/> it <unk w="still"/> is a historic event .

We have already heard from the <unk w="honourable"/> previous <unk w="and"/> how much <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> there was when the <unk w="sitting"/> was first <unk w="time"/> .

It was <unk w="clear"/> that the logistical challenges <unk w="involved"/> in introducing billions of banknotes and coins <unk w=","/> would <unk w="be"/> unmanageable , <unk w="and"/> the idea that we <unk w="can"/> combine a <unk w="european"/> monetary policy with separate fiscal <unk w="measures"/> in the Member <unk w="states"/> was <unk w="simply"/> not <unk w="just"/> as a major challenge but <unk w="is"/> simply impossible .

European monetary union is a reality ; <unk w="the"/> euro has been in <unk w="force"/> for 10 years today .

<unk w="it"/> is <unk w="one"/> of a <unk w="good"/> political miracle , <unk w="and"/> once again the words of Walter Hallstein , the first <unk w="president"/> of the Commission , have proven <unk w="to"/> be <unk w="said"/> : ' Anyone who <unk w="does"/> not believe in <unk w="stockholm"/> in <unk w="these"/> matters <unk w="is"/> not a realist . '

The doubts <unk w="about"/> the citizens , many of whom , in many Member States , <unk w="we"/> believed that <unk w="the"/> euro would result <unk w="in"/> huge price <unk w="prices"/> , have <unk w="not"/> disappeared .

The euro <unk w="has"/> now been accepted , <unk w="and"/> even enthusiastically welcomed by <unk w="the"/> citizens .

It has become something of a visible European identifier : besides the <unk w="flying"/> and the flag , it is one of the few symbols we have today .

It <unk w="is"/> , I think , be said that , in <unk w="the"/> European Central Bank 's first few years , Europe and the European <unk w="union"/> were sailing in relatively calm <unk w="terms"/> , so <unk w="that"/> the <unk w="latter"/> found <unk w="it"/> pretty easy to pursue a <unk w="series"/> of <unk w="it"/> .

Even <unk w="more"/> , it is worth pointing out that the mean inflation rate <unk w="for"/> the <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> 10 <unk w="%"/> of the <unk w="eu"/> has been approximately 2 % , in <unk w="other"/> words <unk w=","/> or <unk w="even"/> on the target that the <unk w="european"/> Central Bank set itself .

<unk w="the"/> German mark , on the other hand , which was always held up <unk w="by"/> a poster <unk w=","/> for stability , had a <unk w="low"/> inflation rate of 3 % over its 50 years of existence .

<unk w="it"/> can therefore be said that the European <unk w="central"/> Bank has performed very <unk w="carefully"/> .

However , it is now , in this time of <unk w="time"/> , that the European Central <unk w="bank"/> is showing its true strength , its true quality .

It has proven itself to <unk w="be"/> independent , <unk w="transparent"/> and self-confident , and it acts decisively <unk w="very"/> quickly .

It has become <unk w="an"/> example for some central banks , both <unk w="in"/> those European countries that are not <unk w="a"/> part of the euro area and <unk w="in"/> Europe .

<unk w="it"/> has made <unk w="it"/> quite clear to the Federal Reserve in the United States that it can pursue a successful policy , not despite <unk w="its"/> independence but precisely because it <unk w="is"/> politically independent <unk w=","/> not subject <unk w="to"/> instructions from <unk w="national"/> governments .

We now know that at the moment , after the banking sectors in the individual Member States have been <unk w="eligible"/> under a protective <unk w="procedure"/> , the Member <unk w="states"/> are in <unk w="the"/> process <unk w="of"/> developing <unk w="the"/> economic <unk w="development"/> plans to absorb the negative impact <unk w="of"/> the financial crisis on <unk w="the"/> real <unk w="problem"/> .

This will present <unk w="the"/> European Central <unk w="bank"/> with further <unk w="details"/> , because there is a risk that the differences in approach will result in distortions of competition , and <unk w="in"/> the convergence we have , in part , now achieved between <unk w="the"/> members of the euro area will be lost <unk w="and"/> we will see increasingly <unk w="positive"/> developments .

This needs <unk w="to"/> be counteracted , which is why it is so crucial and so important that the Stability <unk w="and"/> Growth Pact must not be undermined or discarded .

That <unk w="is"/> why it is also so important for <unk w="the"/> necessary structural <unk w="changes"/> , which the Commission and the European Central <unk w="bank"/> have <unk w="consistently"/> called for in the past , actually to be <unk w="done"/> in the individual <unk w="member"/> States .

The European Central Bank will gain a new task in the <unk w="coming"/> years .

The crisis has taught <unk w="us"/> that we need <unk w="a"/> kind of European supervision of the financial market , and this <unk w="is"/> an <unk w="area"/> where <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="central"/> Bank can play a major role .

It has signalled that <unk w="there"/> is , in principle , willing to introduce some kind <unk w="of"/> central European supervisory system analogous to the European System of Central Banks .

The <unk w="free-trade"/> area needs to speak with one <unk w="another"/> , <unk w="will"/> also be represented as a unit in international organisations such as the International Monetary Fund and the <unk w="commission"/> ( Organisation for Economic Co-operation <unk w="and"/> Development ) .

It is still true that a single currency without a single fiscal economic policy is , and will continue <unk w="to"/> be , a risky <unk w="one"/> .

The <unk w="problem"/> is still facing some major challenges : we are facing high , and unfortunately <unk w="not"/> , levels of unemployment , <unk w="climatic"/> changes , migratory <unk w="flows"/> , <unk w="and"/> poverty in <unk w="all"/> sectors of society , and stiffer competition <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="challenges"/> of globalisation .

The euro area will only be able <unk w="to"/> meet these challenges if the <unk w="internal"/> policies of the Member States can <unk w="work"/> more closely interlinked .

<unk w="the"/> appointment <unk w="is"/> a president of the euro <unk w=","/> was the first step <unk w="in"/> this direction , but it is only the first step : more is now needed .

Mr President , ladies <unk w="and"/> gentlemen , after <unk w="ten"/> years , the growing space carved out by <unk w="the"/> euro <unk w="of"/> international trade and its use as a <unk w="single"/> currency show that it has become a world benchmark .

It <unk w="has"/> guaranteed monetary stability and <unk w="posselt"/> helped integrate the economies of the Member States <unk w="that"/> have adopted it , despite some <unk w="sort"/> of <unk w="problems"/> that created problems for citizens <unk w=","/> because of the actual exchange rates between national currencies <unk w="in"/> the euro and because <unk w="only"/> the few checks subsequently carried out <unk w="at"/> the prices of <unk w="ships"/> and <unk w="consumers"/> .

The <unk w="eu"/> was <unk w="not"/> without being imposed from outside and without <unk w="the"/> wars of conquest or political hegemonies .

<unk w="this"/> was the result <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="council"/> coming <unk w="out"/> of <unk w="the"/> governments who believed in the creation of an economic and monetary union , as <unk w="laid"/> down in the Treaties , as an essential <unk w="factor"/> in attempting <unk w="to"/> achieve the <unk w="european"/> union that still unfortunately remains out of our grasp .

<unk w="the"/> problems <unk w="we"/> have <unk w="to"/> are due to inefficiencies in a system that was unprepared for the task of guiding the other great associated <unk w="countries"/> ; I am talking about the increasing <unk w="number"/> of internationalisation and the great changes in the way <unk w="it"/> is conducted at international level .

The euro has made it possible <unk w="to"/> face up <unk w="to"/> a series of difficulties , the most severe <unk w=","/> which is the <unk w="current"/> financial crisis , and <unk w="he"/> has protected us against the great stresses <unk w="and"/> have ravaged the markets .

<unk w="but"/> it <unk w="is"/> for the <unk w="commission"/> , <unk w="i"/> would have repeated the experience of 1992 , only worse .

<unk w="the"/> mark <unk w="the"/> 10th anniversary by warmly welcoming the entrance of Slovakia , the 16th country to join the euro area .

The measures introduced by the European <unk w="central"/> Bank ( ECB ) <unk w="by"/> the Commission <unk w="to"/> combat <unk w="the"/> current crisis have acted as a buffer and a form of containment <unk w="which"/> we <unk w="must"/> maintain , <unk w="as"/> we <unk w="have"/> often done in <unk w="this"/> Chamber , <unk w="but"/> we find it inconceivable to have a monetary policy disconnected from economic policy .

Admittedly , the <unk w="current"/> situation is somewhat anomalous : 16 <unk w="member"/> States with the single <unk w="market"/> , 27 national economic <unk w="policies"/> coordinated by the Commission <unk w="as"/> well as it can , and 11 Member States with national currencies .

Coordinating a monetary policy with an economic policy that does not actually <unk w="exist"/> is certainly no mean feat , but if the institutions responsible for economic policies in <unk w="our"/> countries do not communicate with the central banks and the ECB , <unk w="it"/> has to <unk w="prepare"/> all those policies together , and vice <unk w="versa"/> , the European Union will <unk w="have"/> new <unk w="investments"/> in jointly facing up to <unk w="the"/> current crisis and also the continual challenges <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="developing"/> world and <unk w="to"/> bring home to us .

We hope that recent experiences convince people of the <unk w="union"/> to face up to change in <unk w="society"/> , restoring the real economy to <unk w="the"/> centre and ensuring better cohesion <unk w="in"/> connection between the ECB and the European institutions <unk w=","/> for laying down political <unk w="regional"/> planning strategy .

The very recent energy <unk w="committee"/> has also <unk w="taught"/> us <unk w="in"/> a common economic policy <unk w=","/> the main strategic topics is of <unk w="great"/> interest to the public and cannot <unk w="be"/> delayed .

If <unk w="the"/> political will is present , the introduction <unk w="of"/> such a policy will <unk w="be"/> facilitated by <unk w="the"/> growing power of the <unk w="eu"/> .

<unk w="mr"/> President , <unk w="the"/> Giscard d 'Estaing , Mr Juncker , Mr Trichet , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to remind you how , in 1992 , when it was still completely dubious <unk w="as"/> to whether the French <unk w="will"/> vote in favour of the Maastricht Treaty , Jacques Delors spoke to <unk w="the"/> general assembly of <unk w="the"/> French Green Party , which <unk w="wishes"/> to <unk w="see"/> the <unk w="remaining"/> 1 % or 2 % .

He said <unk w="to"/> us : ' Vote for the euro , then we will have a political Europe , because if we do not create a political <unk w="will"/> to control Europe , the people will not accept it ; they will never accept it . '

The Maastricht Treaty was approved , <unk w="but"/> no political Europe was created .

This is <unk w="a"/> very problem which we <unk w="discussing"/> facing today .

Firstly , it <unk w="seems"/> to <unk w="ensure"/> that the Maastricht criteria were going to drag <unk w="it"/> into <unk w="the"/> least five years of pro-cyclical recessionary policy and , secondly , <unk w="the"/> way in which <unk w="the"/> monetary <unk w="policy"/> was <unk w="incorporated"/> into the general economic policy by the Maastricht Treaty was not satisfactory .

For the sake <unk w="of"/> the European Central Bank 's independence , we would <unk w="have"/> monetary policy <unk w="and"/> the rest of the policies .

I must say quite honestly that , even if I am still not convinced <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> the Maastricht <unk w="treaty"/> today , like <unk w="all"/> the other Greens , I am rather attracted by the changes which the legislation and application of Economic <unk w="and"/> Monetary Union have undergone .

Firstly , price <unk w="stability"/> has been established <unk w="at"/> a level of <unk w="no"/> less than , but <unk w="also"/> to , 2 % .

At <unk w="the"/> moment , <unk w="in"/> the world <unk w="is"/> being threatened by deflation and the situation <unk w="is"/> being aggravated <unk w="by"/> the tendency <unk w="of"/> some <unk w="people"/> to hastily <unk w="about"/> their VAT rate as part of a <unk w="common"/> policy , <unk w="it"/> is obvious that setting this target <unk w="of"/> 2 % is no longer just <unk w="to"/> show .

If we fail to keep to <unk w="the"/> 2 % target we run <unk w="the"/> risk of having very high real interest rates being forced on us .

The <unk w="second"/> major reform is obviously the reform <unk w="of"/> the Stability <unk w="and"/> Growth Pact carried out in 2005 , which allows us today to have a <unk w="situation"/> that is contracyclical and aimed at countering the crisis .

The third major transformation is <unk w="to"/> change <unk w="and"/> how things <unk w="are"/> in practice .

This permanent dialogue , as highlighted once again in this <unk w="afternoon"/> , between Mr Trichet , <unk w="mr"/> Almunia , Mr Juncker and Mr Barroso , is , strictly speaking , contrary to the Maastricht Treaty itself .

I regard this form of cooperation between <unk w="mr"/> Trichet and Mr Almunia , for example , <unk w="must"/> be the equivalent <unk w="of"/> that between Mr Bernanke <unk w="and"/> Mr Paulson , which is a <unk w="sustainable"/> and desirable development .

All I would <unk w="remind"/> is that we need to apply properly the good aspects of the Maastricht Treaty .

<unk w="we"/> have a <unk w="serious"/> problem in defining the exchange rate , which has <unk w="been"/> mentioned on several occasions by <unk w="your"/> predecessors .

The task of setting the exchange rate is assigned to <unk w="the"/> Council .

<unk w="we"/> must <unk w="use"/> the means <unk w="to"/> ensure <unk w="that"/> the Council sets an <unk w="interest"/> rate for Europe which <unk w="does"/> not <unk w="yet"/> randomly <unk w="in"/> the interest rate chosen by the <unk w="european"/> Central Bank , but properly <unk w="on"/> an industrial policy .

Secondly , the European Central Bank 's objective is not only <unk w="to"/> maintain a rate close to 2 % but also to apply Europe 's <unk w="inability"/> , by <unk w="which"/> I mean the Lisbon and Gothenburg Strategies .

We need to have a policy for <unk w="public"/> and <unk w="the"/> private debts by the European Central Bank according to the Gothenburg and Lisbon Strategies .

<unk w="however"/> , as has already <unk w="been"/> mentioned , there needs <unk w="to"/> be supervision at a European level and the European Central <unk w="bank"/> is in the best position to perform this function .

It <unk w="is"/> regrettable that we are not taking advantage <unk w="of"/> this opportunity for an in-depth examination of <unk w="the"/> consequences <unk w="for"/> implementing neoliberal <unk w="and"/> monetarist policies - using the euro as <unk w="an"/> excuse - which <unk w="has"/> contributed to the current serious <unk w="economic"/> situation and <unk w="of"/> increasing inequality , unemployment , precarious and poorly paid work , and poverty .

It is unacceptable that we are holding onto ideological dogmas , such as price stability and the irrational <unk w="impact"/> of the Stability and Growth Pact , which are being used as a pretext in order <unk w="to"/> pursue privatisation and remove responsibility for social functions <unk w="in"/> the state .

<unk w="this"/> approach also <unk w="concerns"/> the <unk w="framework"/> of the minimal state and the <unk w="energy"/> efficiency of the private sector , with the aim of <unk w="the"/> acceptance of so-called wage restraint , which actually results <unk w="so"/> low , nominal <unk w="price"/> rises <unk w="and"/> even a reduction in real wages , as the Portuguese case regrettably clearly demonstrates .

<unk w="we"/> cannot <unk w="agree"/> with the <unk w="financial"/> independence of the European <unk w="central"/> Bank , which is dragging <unk w="its"/> heels on the decisions to reduce <unk w="interest"/> rates <unk w=","/> which is keeping <unk w="the"/> euro overvalued solely to protect those countries <unk w="in"/> more developed economies <unk w="and"/> the more powerful economic and financial groups , thus worsening the hardships of the <unk w="new"/> fragile economies and those <unk w="working"/> with fewer <unk w="human"/> resources .

This <unk w="european"/> Central Bank <unk w="now"/> has resulted in the <unk w="growth"/> of the <unk w="irish"/> economy , <unk w="thereby"/> demonstrating the need for further reductions in <unk w="the"/> reference interest rates .

<unk w="if"/> the <unk w="purchasing"/> power of workers , the <unk w="elderly"/> and pensioners has <unk w="lost"/> over <unk w="the"/> last 10 years , the <unk w="growth"/> of economic and financial groups have reached their highest level in 30 years , resulting in the <unk w="difference"/> and satisfaction that <unk w="we"/> have heard in this <unk w="chamber"/> .

Even now , in the <unk w="current"/> situation that they have caused , what <unk w="we"/> are doing is <unk w="about"/> the damage <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> order to then privatise the profits , whilst <unk w="others"/> , micro- and small entrepreneurs , the retired and the unemployed suffer <unk w="the"/> consequences of the crisis , with the right , <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="case"/> scenario , <unk w="led"/> to a few scraps .

Look at <unk w="what"/> is happening in <unk w="the"/> financial <unk w="framework"/> , where certain banks have <unk w="already"/> increased their spreads more than once <unk w="again"/> the start <unk w="of"/> the financial crisis and where <unk w="the"/> margin charged <unk w=","/> doubled in the space of a year , <unk w="and"/> penalising new credit even more .

<unk w="we"/> therefore insist on the urgent need for a proper break with these neoliberal and monetarist policies , <unk w="put"/> an end to the Stability Pact , tax havens and <unk w="the"/> false independence of the European Central Bank .

We <unk w="therefore"/> insist <unk w="on"/> the need to significantly increase the EU budget based <unk w="on"/> a fair distribution <unk w="of"/> income and wealth , so that there is a real policy of economic and <unk w="social"/> cohesion and so <unk w="that"/> we <unk w="take"/> measures that <unk w="are"/> just more of the <unk w="commission"/> , in <unk w="the"/> words ' save yourself if you can ' <unk w="talk"/> , allowing the <unk w="eu"/> to become <unk w="a"/> richer <unk w="of"/> the poor <unk w="to"/> become ever <unk w="before"/> , as clearly demonstrated <unk w="by"/> the increasing inequalities and disparities among the euro <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> economies .

We <unk w="must"/> insist on the need to <unk w="improve"/> production <unk w=","/> micro- , small and medium-sized enterprises ; to promote quality public services ; to facilitate credit and improve the purchasing power <unk w="of"/> families , <unk w="and"/> not just <unk w="the"/> most disadvantaged , <unk w="but"/> also the middle <unk w="east"/> ; to create more <unk w="insecurity"/> , and to reduce <unk w="the"/> poverty and misery of millions <unk w="of"/> people in our countries .

on behalf of <unk w="the"/> IND / <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> Group . - Mr President , do enjoy the <unk w="same"/> birthday of the euro because I very much doubt you will be celebrating <unk w="the"/> 20th .

What we have seen this morning has been reminiscent of the <unk w="former"/> Soviet <unk w="union"/> .

Do you remember when the <unk w="action"/> plans <unk w="were"/> announced to be successes often before they were even launched , with much talk of record harvests and wonderful <unk w="the"/> figures for tractors ?

Much like those days , we have been treated <unk w="this"/> morning to a <unk w="lack"/> of unelected , ageing bureaucrats telling <unk w="us"/> what a great success <unk w="the"/> whole thing <unk w="has"/> been .

The idea <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="commission"/> has done a good job is extraordinary .

It was <unk w="in"/> July when the European Central Bank put interest <unk w="in"/> up , just at the <unk w="very"/> moment that the markets were going into <unk w="storage"/> and rates were being slashed <unk w="by"/> the rest of <unk w="the"/> world .

Of course none of <unk w="this"/> surprises me because <unk w="of"/> this <unk w="debate"/> is <unk w="talking"/> about is a <unk w="political"/> class imposing its will upon the peoples of Europe .

Remember that only two countries - Denmark and Sweden - had a referendum on the euro and both <unk w="of"/> them said ' no ' , that little <unk w="is"/> that you try and avoid if you possibly can .

The euro zone has <unk w="already"/> been tested <unk w="and"/> it is about to <unk w="us"/> .

<unk w="however"/> , as German <unk w="liberals"/> at the <unk w="other"/> said , should never <unk w="have"/> joined the <unk w="eu"/> , <unk w="but"/> the situation in <unk w="fiji"/> is , I think , where <unk w="we"/> should focus <unk w="our"/> attention .

Thousands of young people <unk w="suffer"/> on the streets <unk w="and"/> , demanding <unk w="the"/> government does <unk w="not"/> , demanding <unk w="that"/> their government cuts rates , <unk w="and"/> that <unk w="the"/> government <unk w="operates"/> .

But the Greek Government is stuck inside <unk w="and"/> euro straitjacket .

<unk w="there"/> is nothing that a future <unk w="of"/> election can do <unk w="with"/> Greece <unk w="to"/> change <unk w="it"/> .

When people have taken away from them <unk w="the"/> ability to determine their own <unk w="identity"/> through <unk w="the"/> ballot box , then I am afraid that violence becomes the <unk w="most"/> logical alternative .

What you have done with this euro is you <unk w="to"/> trapped people in an economic prison .

You have trapped people in a Völkerkerker from which it will take great courage <unk w="to"/> get out .

It <unk w="will"/> take leadership , or possibly the inevitable economic meltdown .

You can boo , you can jeer , but remember this : Britain outside <unk w="that"/> the euro has been able to devalue , has been able to slash interest rates .

We have been able to do the things <unk w="that"/> we need to do .

Jeer on if you like , but have you noticed that on <unk w="the"/> bond markets this <unk w=":"/> Greek bonds are trading 233 basis points higher than German bonds ?

Now I know that <unk w="all"/> of you in this room will not even know what that <unk w="happens"/> and those that do will do their best to ignore it .

You can go <unk w="back"/> burying your <unk w="career"/> in the sand if you <unk w="are"/> .

<unk w="we"/> can ignore <unk w="the"/> markets if you want to , but in time <unk w=","/> markets will <unk w="not"/> ignore you .

Mr President , in the <unk w="last"/> 200 years <unk w="we"/> have been at least half a dozen <unk w="ago"/> to create single currencies or fixed exchange <unk w="rate"/> mechanisms .

All have <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , <unk w="we"/> have damaged the participants , and so <unk w="it"/> is <unk w="on"/> the <unk w="case"/> .

The imbalances <unk w="are"/> predicted by <unk w="we"/> are starting to bite .

Spain <unk w="'s"/> experience is <unk w="in"/> the bull in the <unk w="world"/> : proud and strong to start with , but bleeding to <unk w="be"/> in the <unk w="future"/> by the end .

Greece 's <unk w="economic"/> unrest is clearly linked to <unk w="competition"/> , resulting from <unk w="the"/> overvalued euro .

<unk w="the"/> spreads <unk w=","/> Greece and Germany have reached unprecedented levels - over <unk w="the"/> basis points .

We <unk w="in"/> Britain can thank heaven that we kept our own currency <unk w=","/> are <unk w="a"/> part of the euro <unk w="area"/> 's slow-motion train wreck .

in <unk w="europe"/> . - The tenth anniversary of the <unk w="debate"/> on the proposal , presented to Parliament , on behalf of <unk w="the"/> Council of <unk w="ministers"/> , by <unk w="mr"/> Brown ( then <unk w="behalf"/> of the Council ) , to lock exchange rates <unk w=","/> that day <unk w="the"/> level and <unk w="to"/> create the euro , is an opportunity to celebrate ten years of success , <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and strength of what is now one of the <unk w="most"/> leading currencies <unk w="in"/> the world .

The current <unk w="economic"/> crisis would have been compounded by <unk w="the"/> on currency markets had we still had <unk w="a"/> peseta , lira , drachma and so on as separate currencies fluctuating wildly <unk w="in"/> each <unk w="year"/> .

The euro <unk w="has"/> been a rock of stability for its <unk w="citizens"/> , as illustrated by the contrasting fortunes of Iceland <unk w="and"/> Ireland .

The anniversary is also an <unk w="opportunity"/> to debate whether Britain <unk w="'s"/> long-term economic <unk w="growth"/> lies <unk w="on"/> euro membership .

Of course , Britain can <unk w=","/> in <unk w="the"/> short run outside the euro , but over time , we stand to lose out : our businesses are handicapped in the European <unk w="union"/> by conversion costs <unk w="and"/> hedging costs that their competitors in that market do not face ; and inward investors <unk w="in"/> the European <unk w="union"/> will <unk w="have"/> to be in <unk w="a"/> major currency area rather than the smaller one .

The formal sitting of the European Parliament <unk w=","/> the 10th anniversary of Economic and <unk w="monetary"/> Union ( EMU ) at a time <unk w="of"/> serious crisis in <unk w="the"/> capitalist system follows repeated resolutions and reports by the European <unk w="parliament"/> on <unk w="the"/> same subject and is yet another <unk w="opportunity"/> to gild the pill <unk w="of"/> the anti-grassroots , <unk w="the"/> policy <unk w="of"/> the EU which , following the demise of socialism , proceeded to <unk w="the"/> Maastricht Treaty and its all-out attack on labour rights and <unk w="democracy"/> .

EMU , the <unk w="objective"/> of the <unk w="european"/> Central Bank and <unk w="the"/> launch <unk w="of"/> the euro are necessary links in the chain of capitalist restructurings being <unk w="caused"/> by capital in order to <unk w="protect"/> itself against workers ' claims and safeguard its profitability by stepping <unk w="up"/> the exploitation <unk w="of"/> the working class <unk w="and"/> grassroots <unk w="""/> .

The arguments about price <unk w="stability"/> , <unk w="the"/> inflation and protecting economies <unk w="at"/> risk and crisis have proven to be stale arguments .

EMU protects the profits <unk w="of"/> the monopolies and facilitates <unk w="terrorism"/> and merger .

This past <unk w="war"/> , workers <unk w="have"/> seen their incomes <unk w="on-line"/> , industrial relations worsen , their insurance rights <unk w=","/> and health and education <unk w="to"/> deteriorate and made <unk w="them"/> privatised <unk w="projects"/> .

Workers <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="new"/> one-way street and its supporters , and also the Lisbon Strategy and <unk w="the"/> Lisbon Treaty , and are <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> against EMU and the <unk w="union"/> itself for grassroots <unk w="management"/> and a grassroots economy .

In the debate about the euro I want to draw attention to three negative aspects of <unk w="environmental"/> performance .

Firstly , <unk w="at"/> the moment <unk w="on"/> the euro was <unk w="still"/> , in other words from 2002 to <unk w="the"/> inclusive , the three Member States which <unk w="are"/> outside the euro area ( <unk w="finland"/> , Sweden <unk w="and"/> Denmark ) developed <unk w="more"/> than the countries which were <unk w="in"/> the euro area .

<unk w="the"/> national income in those countries grew almost twice as fast as the average for the <unk w="free-trade"/> area , and the <unk w="rate"/> of unemployment was lower .

<unk w="however"/> , the battle with the effects of <unk w="the"/> current financial and economic crisis <unk w="is"/> clearly more effective in those countries than <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="free-trade"/> area .

The central <unk w="points"/> of <unk w="finland"/> , Sweden and Denmark very quickly and clearly reduced interest rates while ensuring liquidity to <unk w="central"/> banks .

It also seems <unk w="that"/> the fiscal policy pursued by these countries will <unk w="be"/> more <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> than the fiscal policy in <unk w="the"/> euro area .

Thirdly , new Member States which are preparing to enter the <unk w="free-trade"/> area have to <unk w="deal"/> with many monetary and fiscal criteria <unk w="for"/> years <unk w="of"/> entry .

Some of these criteria <unk w="are"/> mutually contradictory , <unk w="such"/> as the need to <unk w="be"/> present in the <unk w="meda"/> II <unk w="package"/> - <unk w="and"/> therefore the need <unk w="to"/> maintain the national currency 's <unk w="interest"/> rate against the euro <unk w="is"/> a fluctuation band of ± 15 % - and at the same time <unk w=","/> maintain a low level <unk w="of"/> inflation .

Counteracting devaluation pressure <unk w="on"/> the national currency means <unk w="the"/> need for intervention <unk w="in"/> central banks , which <unk w="are"/> putting greater amounts of the national <unk w="energies"/> into circulation , which obviously increases inflationary <unk w="costs"/> .

As the Commission wants to encourage <unk w="the"/> Member <unk w="states"/> , it should consider eliminating this obvious inconsistency .

Mr President , <unk w="ladies"/> and <unk w="gentlemen"/> , <unk w="the"/> Economic and <unk w="monetary"/> Union began on 1 January <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> , and 11 EU Member <unk w="states"/> adopted the <unk w="single"/> currency at <unk w="the"/> same <unk w="time"/> .

At the same <unk w="time"/> , Slovakia became the 16th country to use <unk w="the"/> euro .

Just as Mr Juncker stated <unk w="in"/> Parliament <unk w="and"/> his <unk w="opinion"/> , <unk w="the"/> euro is <unk w="almost"/> definitely an ' anchor <unk w="'"/> stability ' .

This <unk w="is"/> something the countries <unk w="which"/> have <unk w="been"/> left <unk w="out"/> of <unk w="the"/> euro <unk w="that"/> have been made painfully aware of .

Although the <unk w="50th"/> anniversary of the euro is overshadowed by worries of a <unk w="political"/> deepening of the recession , I <unk w="live"/> in the euro area 's ability to emerge from the crisis .

This <unk w="will"/> nevertheless <unk w="a"/> considerable effort <unk w="on"/> the part of the <unk w="commission"/> .

<unk w="according"/> to <unk w="the"/> latest estimates , the effect of the agreed stimulus <unk w=","/> will be <unk w="much"/> less <unk w="than"/> the 1.5 % of gross domestic <unk w="product"/> planned for the area .

The euro has been an <unk w="economic"/> success , but would not <unk w="have"/> been <unk w="possible"/> for <unk w="the"/> continuous efforts made .

<unk w="what"/> we need to strengthen <unk w="turkey"/> 's <unk w="sake"/> in the supervision of <unk w="the"/> financial markets .

<unk w="we"/> have <unk w="to"/> keep to the <unk w="same"/> principles and <unk w="principles"/> of <unk w="economic"/> and Monetary Union .

<unk w="on"/> 1 January <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> the euro became the official currency <unk w="in"/> Slovakia .

From that <unk w="time"/> , the double cross on three hills from the <unk w="korean"/> flag has <unk w="never"/> appeared on one-euro and two-euro coins and has been <unk w="put"/> into circulation <unk w="in"/> the euro <unk w="externally"/> .

That <unk w="fact"/> was a historic moment for <unk w="europe"/> and we Slovaks are very <unk w="pleased"/> to be the <unk w="only"/> country from the former Socialist bloc to introduce the euro in <unk w="a"/> symbolic year of the 10th anniversary <unk w="of"/> the euro area .

I am appreciative <unk w="about"/> the fact <unk w="that"/> the current <unk w="turkish"/> Government has subscribed to the commitment of Mikuláš Dzurinda , whose <unk w="objective"/> , in <unk w="march"/> 2004 , adopted a plan to <unk w="reform"/> the koruna with the <unk w="single"/> currency and <unk w="at"/> the beginning <unk w="of"/> 2009 as the target date .

It also seems appropriate here on the floor of the EP to thank the Slovak <unk w=","/> because <unk w="it"/> was <unk w="not"/> , as the main actors in the challenging but necessary ' <unk w="of"/> ' reforms , who persevered and helped Slovakia to become a successful European country .

From 1 <unk w=","/> 2009 the euro will link the people of Slovakia <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="day"/> every day .

<unk w="the"/> introduction of <unk w="the"/> European single currency 10 years ago marked <unk w="the"/> completion of a process whose implications go far <unk w="beyond"/> the economic sector .

The finalisation <unk w="of"/> the Economic and <unk w="monetary"/> Union process demonstrated Member <unk w="states"/> ' commitment <unk w="to"/> safeguard the EU 's economic and political unity .

The euro 's success therefore <unk w="creates"/> success in the process <unk w="of"/> building an entity <unk w="and"/> to promote European values at international <unk w="level"/> and confirm the <unk w="european"/> Union <unk w="as"/> the main player <unk w="in"/> business and financial relations within <unk w="the"/> global economy .

I <unk w="believe"/> that the benefits offered by adopting the euro , involving <unk w="price"/> stability , a <unk w="dramatic"/> reduction in <unk w="market"/> fluctuations , <unk w="the"/> promotion of job creation <unk w="and"/> support for productivity growth , all underpinned by strengthening resistance to external shocks , justify <unk w="all"/> the efforts made <unk w="by"/> the <unk w="individual"/> Member States , <unk w="including"/> Romania , to meet the convergence criteria <unk w="as"/> soon as <unk w="possible"/> and join <unk w="the"/> euro area .

Since <unk w="the"/> euro was launched <unk w="on"/> 1 January <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> , the <unk w="european"/> currency has , in many respects , proven to be an important <unk w="step"/> in the <unk w="future"/> of the EU economy .

The <unk w="european"/> currency is , first of all , a driving force for European exchanges : the <unk w="question"/> of exchange rates in the euro <unk w="area"/> is an <unk w="important"/> and visible benefit <unk w="european"/> citizens , and <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> mobility within the EU .

<unk w="in"/> addition to the obvious benefits , the <unk w="commission"/> has also emerged as an anchor in the <unk w="bse"/> crisis .

<unk w="such"/> a major currency used by many <unk w="member"/> States <unk w="and"/> national economies <unk w="and"/> able to cushion the dramatic effects of economic collapse .

Monetary union means that macroeconomic levers can be applied at <unk w="community"/> level and active responses can be <unk w="given"/> to the financial crisis .

Finally , though , the euro is also a <unk w="process"/> of European integration and the long road that the European people have already travelled <unk w="again"/> .

Monetary union <unk w="is"/> the next logical step after economic union , and should also pave the way <unk w="for"/> deeper <unk w="european"/> integration .

Nearly <unk w="a"/> year ago , when marking the 10th <unk w="application"/> of the <unk w="president"/> of <unk w="the"/> European Central Bank ( ECB ) and Economic <unk w="and"/> Monetary Union ( EMU ) , we <unk w="welcome"/> the fact that : ' In the ten years <unk w="there"/> has been <unk w="in"/> existence , the <unk w="progress"/> achieved by EMU are a resounding success . '

I think that this assessment is quite appropriate as I am a strong <unk w="interest"/> in the importance of <unk w="national"/> solidarity which Member States need to <unk w="participate"/> in their joint actions to combat the effects <unk w="of"/> the financial crisis and reduce the adverse impact <unk w="of"/> the global economic crisis .

<unk w="it"/> is in its most precarious economic situation since the end of the Second World War .

<unk w="in"/> this climate , marking the <unk w="50th"/> anniversary of the introduction of the <unk w="convention"/> must refocus our attention on <unk w="the"/> major European integration projects .

<unk w="the"/> introduction of the <unk w="european"/> single currency and <unk w="the"/> creation of <unk w="changes"/> were <unk w="the"/> decisions made through harmonisation and solidarity based on European values .

Europe 's competitiveness <unk w="continues"/> to <unk w="be"/> maintained within the euro <unk w="zone"/> and must be boosted in Member <unk w="states"/> which <unk w="are"/> preparing to <unk w="make"/> the euro area .

Furthermore , EMU members ' diverse interests must <unk w="give"/> secondary priority to the EU 's common economic interests .

Madam President , I <unk w="have"/> been <unk w="asked"/> to wave to an usher throughout the voting procedure in order to give <unk w="explanations"/> of vote , but because you conducted votes so <unk w="on"/> and we got through them <unk w="very"/> quickly , an usher has <unk w="been"/> quite <unk w="for"/> it too me yet .

I <unk w="am"/> holding a <unk w="piece"/> of paper asking to <unk w="ask"/> two <unk w="oral"/> explanations of vote <unk w="on"/> the McGuinness and <unk w="two"/> reports .

I <unk w="would"/> appreciate <unk w="that"/> if you would allow me to do <unk w="so"/> .

Madam President , likewise , if I <unk w="would"/> have the same forbearance .

My request is <unk w="in"/> its way to you as well .

( IT ) Madam President , <unk w="ladies"/> and gentlemen , it gives me great pleasure to speak in this great parliamentary Chamber , crowded <unk w="the"/> Members from all 27 of our Member <unk w="states"/> .

I <unk w="cannot"/> get such an opportunity <unk w="to"/> make myself heard by so many .

It falls to me on this occasion to explain my vote in favour of the report by <unk w="mr"/> Belder <unk w="on"/> trade and economic relations with Western Balkans .

I am absolutely in favour of the European Union making it as <unk w="soon"/> as possible for these Balkan states to join the European Union .

I believe <unk w="that"/> it is important for economic <unk w="growth"/> to be higher than that allocated <unk w="to"/> date , and that we should <unk w="make"/> it possible to increase links between the Balkan <unk w="countries"/> and <unk w="countries"/> , develop tourism <unk w="will"/> allow all Balkan <unk w="countries"/> , young and old , to <unk w="achieve"/> a better life than they have until <unk w="now"/> .

Madam <unk w="president"/> , first , I just wish to record the fact that I pressed the wrong button <unk w="of"/> the McGuinness report .

In fact , I completely support the McGuinness report on food security - but I <unk w="can"/> check that with <unk w="the"/> services <unk w="""/> .

I <unk w="cannot"/> agree with the point that we <unk w="have"/> to adapt the <unk w="regulations"/> to meet food <unk w="safety"/> concerns <unk w="about"/> the fact that farmers need a stable policy environment <unk w="in"/> order to plan for the future .

We cannot have <unk w="it"/> , <unk w="but"/> we certainly need to have <unk w="political"/> stability .

In <unk w="conclusion"/> , I support the fact that the market alone cannot provide income security for <unk w="consumers"/> and also the call <unk w="for"/> a detailed impact assessment , in particular , <unk w="let"/> us say , on the implications for food security .

If we look at particular EU proposals , for example on plant <unk w="protection"/> , again we need a proper detailed <unk w="commission"/> assessment on that , and <unk w="we"/> need to take food <unk w="down"/> into consideration when we conduct that assessment .

<unk w="mr"/> President , I <unk w="would"/> like to <unk w="thank"/> colleagues for their endorsement of this report and Marian Harkin <unk w="and"/> her <unk w="report"/> of <unk w="it"/> .

<unk w="it"/> presents a clear statement of <unk w="the"/> view <unk w="of"/> this House on agriculture policy , not <unk w="just"/> at the European <unk w="union"/> , but <unk w="also"/> at a global <unk w="level"/> .

In particular - <unk w="and"/> this is important - it calls for a <unk w="debate"/> on agriculture <unk w="collection"/> in the developing world , providing assistance to those who can <unk w="buy"/> food to do so locally .

I believe the EUR 1 billion that <unk w="the"/> European Union will provide for this purpose is a step <unk w="in"/> the right <unk w="direction"/> .

I believe it <unk w="is"/> a blueprint for <unk w="the"/> future <unk w="in"/> terms of how <unk w="this"/> House views agriculture .

<unk w="in"/> the food <unk w="production"/> debate has <unk w="been"/> off the political <unk w="solution"/> , the problem of 30 000 <unk w="and"/> dying <unk w="of"/> hunger <unk w="and"/> starvation every <unk w="week"/> remains with us .

Madam President , I <unk w="am"/> grateful to you for giving <unk w="me"/> the <unk w="floor"/> to explain why I abstained on the McGuinness report .

<unk w="it"/> focuses on a very important aspect of <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> and that <unk w="is"/> the <unk w="best"/> essentiality of ensuring food supplies <unk w="for"/> those who are starving or <unk w="people"/> who <unk w="do"/> not <unk w="have"/> a proper food supply .

Nobody could be against that , and I am certainly <unk w="not"/> against that .

But <unk w="the"/> problem with the report , <unk w="in"/> my <unk w="opinion"/> , is that <unk w="it"/> looks and refers to the <unk w="common"/> agricultural policy <unk w="but"/> does <unk w="not"/> address the fact <unk w="that"/> there is an urgent need for the reform , and further reform , of <unk w="competition"/> policy .

<unk w="it"/> is not serving <unk w="the"/> people of Europe well ; it is not serving <unk w="the"/> farmers of Britain well .

Until that burden is <unk w="far"/> away from <unk w="the"/> European taxpayers , then we <unk w="are"/> going <unk w="to"/> be in difficulties .

Yes , the objectives <unk w="of"/> the report are right , but I am afraid <unk w="that"/> it fails very badly in addressing <unk w="the"/> core problem .

( PL ) I fully endorse most of the proposals <unk w="and"/> statements contained in the <unk w="swoboda"/> report , which was adopted a moment ago .

<unk w="the"/> fluctuations in food prices <unk w="are"/> going <unk w="to"/> occur in the global market with increasing frequency , which will have negative consequences .

Price <unk w="stability"/> are felt most by low-income families , who <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> a significant proportion of their budget <unk w="for"/> food .

It is just <unk w="one"/> people who <unk w="can"/> help : the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> needy people , both in developing <unk w="countries"/> and in <unk w="the"/> European Union .

I agree that the common agricultural policy <unk w="must"/> be adapted to the new conditions <unk w="in"/> order to better <unk w="solve"/> the problems of food <unk w="supplements"/> , and this <unk w="is"/> why the removal of instruments which manage markets <unk w="and"/> a reduction in the level of EU expenditure on agriculture in the <unk w="eu"/> financial <unk w="framework"/> should <unk w="be"/> opposed .

<unk w="it"/> is a good <unk w="way"/> to establish an international <unk w="agreement"/> which will observe the prices of agricultural products and factors of their production under the auspices of <unk w="the"/> Food and Agriculture Organization , in order to monitor these data on a world <unk w="market"/> and to be <unk w="able"/> to <unk w="react"/> rapidly to fluctuations .

I think the establishment <unk w="of"/> a world system <unk w="for"/> storing food supplies should also be considered .

<unk w="mr"/> President , I am grateful <unk w="for"/> this opportunity to explain why I <unk w="have"/> abstained on this report .

I think most people in this Chamber , from whatever part of the political <unk w="groups"/> they come <unk w="from"/> , <unk w="we"/> agree that food security is very important .

The <unk w="first"/> is that we do not agree on what food <unk w="aid"/> is .

To <unk w="all"/> of us , <unk w="social"/> security is making <unk w="sure"/> that <unk w="there"/> is enough food for the people of <unk w="the"/> world - wherever they come from .

<unk w="the"/> security to <unk w="the"/> means only food <unk w="production"/> in the EU <unk w="as"/> Europeans .

' Local <unk w="economy"/> ' is a phrase that I often hear used .

I hear people <unk w="have"/> the excuse of food security to keep <unk w="their"/> imports <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="rest"/> of the world , thereby <unk w="providing"/> the high-quality exports that we see from many of the poorer countries of the world and <unk w="the"/> many more <unk w="people"/> in poorer countries to poverty .

To say that a common agricultural policy should <unk w="be"/> the cornerstone of food security is an <unk w="official"/> statement which needs to be <unk w="laid"/> down .

Madam President , I <unk w="agree"/> with <unk w="the"/> comments made by <unk w="the"/> excellent colleague Mr Syed Kamall on <unk w="this"/> matter .

I abstained because it was my <unk w="colleague"/> 's whip to abstain on this report , but everybody <unk w="believes"/> that food <unk w="production"/> is a very important subject to <unk w="us"/> all , which is why I am bemused by the way that this place <unk w=","/> with such a matter .

In this particular report - which I believe <unk w="we"/> all voted for - we <unk w="solve"/> the problem we were just <unk w="trying"/> to create for ourselves by voting <unk w="for"/> the <unk w="environmental"/> protection products directive .

<unk w="the"/> three minutes after we voted <unk w="for"/> this report we were basically <unk w="convinced"/> that our <unk w="opinion"/> would not be able to grow enough food for our continent in the future .

It <unk w="is"/> a shame that nobody else <unk w="wishes"/> to read <unk w="some"/> of these reports <unk w="to"/> go <unk w="into"/> this place .

Madam President , <unk w="one"/> of the <unk w="main"/> concerns <unk w=","/> one of the keys <unk w="in"/> relation <unk w="to"/> global food <unk w="production"/> is to ensure sufficient , <unk w="adult"/> production and , <unk w="therefore"/> , food security in the so-called developed world , <unk w="such"/> as here in the EU , so that we can <unk w="achieve"/> our surplus <unk w=","/> and are not competing ourselves on world markets for food , thereby increasing the prices <unk w="for"/> those in regions <unk w="which"/> do not <unk w="have"/> the climate , the soil , the <unk w="large"/> and <unk w="public"/> investment to produce their own food .

We have to be very <unk w="pleased"/> with our policies to ensure that we are <unk w="not"/> not only environmentally but also globally to the necessity for sustainable food <unk w="production"/> .

( SK ) I voted for the <unk w="resolution"/> on the common agricultural <unk w="policy"/> and <unk w="for"/> food security because it deals with <unk w="something"/> that I have consistently been raising <unk w="in"/> the European Parliament as matters <unk w="of"/> priority .

<unk w="the"/> first issues involves the <unk w="increase"/> in producer <unk w="liability"/> , <unk w="which"/> will lead to greater global <unk w="development"/> .

The second issue is the reduction in <unk w="the"/> volatility of food markets , <unk w="caused"/> by increasing stocks .

<unk w="my"/> third <unk w="point"/> concerns halting the decline in <unk w="the"/> social <unk w="aspects"/> of agriculture by <unk w="increasing"/> public awareness of its unique and irreplaceable <unk w="role"/> .

The fourth issue concerns <unk w="which"/> the random operation <unk w="of"/> the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) by <unk w="providing"/> a systemic <unk w="overhaul"/> of the policy <unk w="and"/> a focus on long-term objectives .

The <unk w="second"/> and final issue involves putting a stop to the agricultural decline in the <unk w="individual"/> Member States <unk w="covered"/> by the CAP 's discriminatory principles , while significantly boosting utilisation of <unk w="the"/> agricultural potential in <unk w="developing"/> countries , the new <unk w="member"/> States .

Madam President , this goes to the core <unk w="of"/> this whole European Union .

Here we are approving <unk w="this"/> money to try and <unk w="urge"/> the public to vote for <unk w="the"/> wretched Lisbon Treaty .

The public , on being given a <unk w="priority"/> in the Republic of Ireland , made <unk w="it"/> absolutely clear that <unk w="we"/> do <unk w="not"/> want it and if the people of Britain were to be <unk w="in"/> a <unk w="result"/> - <unk w="that"/> they should have been because they were <unk w="doing"/> it in <unk w="the"/> last <unk w="of"/> election by <unk w="the"/> Labour Government - they would also vote <unk w="upon"/> to reject <unk w="the"/> Treaty .

The message should <unk w="be"/> heard loud and clear in <unk w="the"/> European Union , it really should : people do <unk w="not"/> want it .

People <unk w="do"/> not want <unk w="to"/> control in Brussels <unk w="and"/> Strasbourg .

People want their own governments and their own <unk w="countries"/> to be making the decisions that affect them .

Until <unk w="this"/> message is <unk w="that"/> we will <unk w="have"/> pumping more taxpayers ' money into forcing people to the polling box <unk w="and"/> the pretence that you <unk w="can"/> persuade <unk w="them"/> to change their minds .

Madam President , first of all I <unk w="would"/> like to say that this is an excellent <unk w="report"/> .

We are always speaking about connecting the EU to its <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and the fact that <unk w="the"/> EU project <unk w="can"/> proceed without the involvement of EU <unk w="citizens"/> .

<unk w="there"/> are two types of <unk w="action"/> : representative , which <unk w="we"/> have in this House , and participative , which is <unk w="why"/> this <unk w="debate"/> is all about .

However , it is <unk w="important"/> to understand that <unk w="the"/> dialogue is <unk w="based"/> .

Therefore , <unk w="the"/> concerns and ideas put <unk w="forward"/> by citizens <unk w="to"/> be <unk w="taken"/> into consideration by <unk w="the"/> EU institutions .

I think we have an excellent example of that in the <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> million signatures for disability and the document that we are debating in this Parliament <unk w="at"/> the moment .

I disagree with the last speaker because I believe , if we do <unk w="everything"/> the Lisbon <unk w="summit"/> , that it gives us the opportunity to <unk w="protect"/> citizens to <unk w="the"/> EU in a <unk w="much"/> more meaningful way .

Our role in this <unk w="matter"/> is to ensure , <unk w="if"/> we pass the Lisbon Treaty , that it works effectively .

<unk w="mr"/> President , much <unk w="can"/> be inferred from the title of <unk w="the"/> report : ' Perspectives for <unk w="the"/> civil dialogue under <unk w="the"/> Treaty of Lisbon ' .

Never mind <unk w="however"/> , <unk w="but"/> it seems periodically <unk w="me"/> to remind this House , the Treaty of Lisbon is not <unk w="in"/> force .

It has been <unk w="several"/> times rejected in <unk w="all"/> several forms by 55 % <unk w="of"/> French voters , <unk w="spend"/> 62 % of Dutch voters and by 54 % <unk w="of"/> Irish voters .

Focus rather on the Orwellian Ministry of Love <unk w="because"/> of the title ' Perspectives for <unk w="the"/> civil dialogue ' .

Now , <unk w="the"/> voters unversed <unk w="to"/> the peculiar idiom <unk w="of"/> the European Union might not understand those words , as we <unk w="in"/> this House <unk w="today"/> , to mean creating a <unk w="new"/> propaganda <unk w="and"/> to try <unk w="and"/> convince people to change their minds .

I have to say that <unk w="almost"/> every euro in the <unk w="light"/> of the <unk w="european"/> Central <unk w="largest"/> will serve <unk w="to"/> convince people of an intrinsically bad <unk w="light"/> .

The <unk w="commission"/> has to <unk w="be"/> able to receive as well as <unk w="possible"/> .

<unk w="mr"/> President , thank you for giving me the opportunity to explain the way I voted <unk w="for"/> this <unk w="report"/> .

When I read the <unk w="conclusions"/> of the report , ' Civil dialogue under <unk w="the"/> Treaty <unk w="on"/> Lisbon ' , it reminded <unk w="us"/> of a phrase by <unk w="the"/> Gandhi .

When <unk w="i"/> was asked <unk w="for"/> Western <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , he said , that ' that <unk w="would"/> be a <unk w="good"/> idea ' .

Therefore , when I <unk w="confirm"/> this title , ' Civil dialogue under the Treaty <unk w="of"/> Lisbon ' , I thought , ' that would be a good idea , would it <unk w="be"/> ? '

One of the <unk w="previous"/> speakers said that dialogue is very much a two-way process , but if we look <unk w="at"/> some <unk w="of"/> the civil society organisations being funded in order to promote the Treaty of Lisbon , we only see <unk w="something"/> that <unk w="we"/> fully signed up <unk w="to"/> promoting <unk w="the"/> fundamentally undemocratic Treaty .

<unk w="the"/> many organisations that are against <unk w="the"/> Treaty will be funded or will be allowed <unk w="to"/> be <unk w="banned"/> ?

There is <unk w="no"/> two-way dialogue , <unk w="and"/> that is why the citizens <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="union"/> , when <unk w="they"/> are given the chance and asked about the Treaty of Lisbon , will choose to reject it .

Madam President , <unk w="thank"/> you <unk w="asked"/> for your patience <unk w="in"/> the Chamber .

I wanted to speak on this but I have just got too much to say today , I am so excited <unk w="with"/> all the votes that have <unk w="been"/> going through the Chamber today .

Yes , the common fisheries policy ; <unk w="however"/> , let us <unk w="bring"/> about sustainable development - but the two are inherently <unk w="priorities"/> .

Look at those countries where fishermen are given rights that are <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and passed on from generation to generation .

That is the best way to make sure that we have sustainable fish stocks , not some artificial communistic method where you have <unk w="been"/> planning in fishing .

We will return to the explanations of vote <unk w="at"/> the <unk w="plenary"/> sitting .

Mr President of the Republic of Latvia , the right <unk w="of"/> Valdis Zatlers , it is a <unk w="very"/> great pleasure for us all to be able to <unk w="congratulate"/> you today on your first <unk w="question"/> to <unk w="the"/> European Parliament .

I should like to start by <unk w="reminding"/> you , <unk w="and"/> the President of a country which is <unk w="in"/> a relatively <unk w="small"/> Member <unk w="state"/> of the European Union , for accepting the European <unk w="union"/> 's invitation to address us today , the <unk w="situation"/> on which we are celebrating the 10th anniversary of our common currency , <unk w="the"/> euro .

Today <unk w="is"/> a premiere <unk w="and"/> every sense of the word , as this was the first time that the <unk w="european"/> hymn has been played to welcome a <unk w="visit"/> to plenary <unk w="session"/> in the European Parliament .

May I take this opportunity to mention once <unk w="again"/> today <unk w="'s"/> historic significance of the enlargement of the European Union in 2004 .

It <unk w="is"/> over 60 years to <unk w="get"/> your country back <unk w="to"/> a free and democratic Europe and unify our continent .

Our citizens <unk w="'"/> prospects <unk w="of"/> our forefathers could only have dreamed of .

It <unk w="is"/> true that today the European <unk w="union"/> faces new and <unk w="new"/> challenges .

Even the people of Latvia <unk w="have"/> come <unk w="to"/> feel this quite <unk w="clearly"/> , for <unk w=","/> as a result of the financial <unk w="framework"/> , which <unk w="is"/> also <unk w="in"/> your country hard , Mr President .

The gas <unk w="cooperation"/> between Russia and Ukraine is also giving the citizens of Latvia justified cause for <unk w="concern"/> .

It is precisely <unk w="these"/> times <unk w="of"/> crisis that we understand the value of membership <unk w="of"/> a European <unk w="union"/> based <unk w="on"/> the principle of solidarity between its peoples .

It is precisely in this time <unk w="to"/> crisis that we all feel the need for <unk w="peace"/> and cooperation <unk w="between"/> our <unk w="citizens"/> and the European institutions .

Together we <unk w="become"/> stronger , <unk w="and"/> we can defend <unk w="our"/> interests and values better throughout the world .

<unk w="that"/> is <unk w="precisely"/> why <unk w="the"/> European Parliament hopes the <unk w="maastricht"/> Treaty , which gives the European Union a <unk w="military"/> capacity <unk w="to"/> act to overcome these <unk w="new"/> challenges , will <unk w="not"/> enter into force .

In this respect , the European Parliament elections due <unk w="to"/> take place in June this year <unk w="is"/> immensely important , because we want <unk w="to"/> push ahead <unk w="with"/> the success story <unk w="of"/> the European peace and unification project together , in a democratic European Union with a European Parliament with codecision powers in <unk w="almost"/> every area .

I truly hope that <unk w="the"/> citizens of Latvia - and of all the <unk w="eu"/> Member States of the European Union - will <unk w="ensure"/> that their vote is important because it gives them European powers of codecision <unk w="and"/> in <unk w="this"/> sense will turn out <unk w="of"/> force during the forthcoming elections to the European Parliament .

Mr <unk w="president"/> , it gives me great pleasure <unk w="to"/> invite <unk w="you"/> now to address the <unk w="european"/> Parliament .

<unk w="naturally"/> I warmly welcome you once again <unk w="to"/> the European Parliament .

Mr President , <unk w="ladies"/> and <unk w="gentlemen"/> , I thank <unk w="the"/> President for his kind words <unk w="in"/> introduction and his <unk w="need"/> to address the elected representatives of the nations of Europe .

I take <unk w="great"/> pleasure in addressing the <unk w="european"/> Parliament in my <unk w="mother"/> tongue , <unk w="not"/> because <unk w=","/> five years now , Latvian has been one of the official languages of the European Union .

I <unk w="am"/> speaking <unk w="to"/> you today at a time when the term <unk w="occupation"/> office of the first Members of the European Parliament to be elected from Latvia is drawing to a close .

I <unk w="urge"/> you <unk w=","/> having carried out your <unk w="relationship"/> with distinction .

Dear friends , <unk w="last"/> year , 2009 , <unk w="is"/> a very significant <unk w="margin"/> for Latvia .

It is five <unk w="years"/> since Latvia acceded to the European Union and to NATO .

Membership <unk w="of"/> these international organisations became a strategic <unk w="objective"/> for <unk w="years"/> following the restoration of independence in 1991 .

Latvia clearly <unk w="expresses"/> its <unk w="desire"/> to participate <unk w="in"/> European and transatlantic economic and security structures .

The <unk w="importance"/> of the family of European democratic nations in the first decade of the 21st century <unk w=","/> the most dynamic changes in Europe since the <unk w="enlargement"/> of the European Union .

European structures were joined by nations that had long <unk w="been"/> isolated by force from them , even though the values that lie <unk w="at"/> the heart of the European Union had historically <unk w="been"/> rooted <unk w="in"/> these nations .

On 18 November <unk w="last"/> year , Latvia <unk w="and"/> the 90th anniversary of its proclamation .

It once again affirmed our <unk w="political"/> will to <unk w="be"/> in <unk w="an"/> independent , <unk w="transparent"/> and <unk w="a"/> nation .

In the act <unk w="of"/> the Republic of Latvia in 1918 it <unk w="is"/> written that : ' All citizens regardless of their ethnic <unk w="origin"/> are called on <unk w="to"/> give their assistance , <unk w="and"/> all human rights shall be guaranteed in Latvia .

It shall <unk w="be"/> a democratic and just nation , where <unk w="we"/> shall be no <unk w="blame"/> for <unk w="peace"/> and injustice ... ' .

Thirty years before <unk w="the"/> adoption of <unk w="the"/> Universal <unk w="declaration"/> of Human Rights , <unk w="the"/> Republic of Latvia declared its <unk w="opposition"/> to its fundamental values and principles .

Latvia <unk w="has"/> always felt itself <unk w="to"/> belong <unk w="to"/> Europe and its values , even when <unk w=","/> and <unk w="the"/> Central and Eastern <unk w="european"/> nations were long bound to a state <unk w="where"/> many values were looked <unk w="into"/> through a special ideological prism .

Peace reigned among the nations <unk w="of"/> the Eastern bloc , but it was the peace of the <unk w="european"/> courtyard .

It <unk w="is"/> brought <unk w="forward"/> by the <unk w="ministry"/> of tanks , <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and threats .

Last year , ladies <unk w="and"/> gentlemen , both you and the whole of Europe were reminded <unk w="of"/> the inhumanity of <unk w="their"/> ideology by Edvīns  nore <unk w="country"/> <unk w="film"/> ' A <unk w="union"/> <unk w="Story"/> ' .

<unk w="we"/> have a common history , <unk w="and"/> our fates have been diverse .

You have to look back into the past <unk w="in"/> order to understand one another and look to the future together .

That is <unk w="why"/> I should <unk w="like"/> to thank <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="parliament"/> for <unk w="the"/> declaration adopted on 22 September last year to proclaim <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> August as the <unk w="other"/> Day <unk w="and"/> Remembrance for Victims of <unk w="terrorism"/> and <unk w="terrorism"/> .

This declaration reminds the <unk w="whole"/> of Europe of these tragic events in the history of Latvia and <unk w="the"/> whole of Europe .

Today , I <unk w="would"/> like to look <unk w="very"/> much more <unk w="to"/> history .

This year marks <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> years since <unk w="it"/> became a member of the European Union and <unk w="by"/> NATO .

What have our nation 's achievements been and <unk w="there"/> are <unk w="the"/> challenges still ahead of us ?

<unk w="secondly"/> , the aspiration to become part of <unk w="and"/> encouraged the consolidation of democracy in <unk w="civil"/> society and contributed <unk w="to"/> the <unk w="reform"/> of democratic institutions .

With our accession to the European Union , Latvia signalled <unk w="its"/> determination for <unk w="its"/> own future , its determination to found its future on a European identity and <unk w="on"/> our common values : <unk w="democracy"/> and <unk w="tolerance"/> , accountability , the rule <unk w="of"/> law and human rights , <unk w="dignity"/> , tolerance and prosperity .

Secondly , membership of the European Union has improved the <unk w="political"/> climate in Latvia .

' European money ' , as we commonly call European Union structural funds , <unk w="which"/> contributed significantly to the development <unk w="of"/> Latvia 's economy .

Thirdly , we can <unk w="support"/> the privileges afforded by the free movement <unk w="of"/> persons .

<unk w="to"/> travel in the Schengen area has become so customary and self-evident ; it has <unk w="been"/> so natural to learn , work and <unk w="the"/> experience in <unk w="the"/> European Union Member States .

<unk w="firstly"/> , <unk w="the"/> free movement of goods and services has opened up new <unk w="transactions"/> for business .

Every entrepreneur <unk w="the"/> consumer can operate in a free environment without borders and without customs duties .

For us in a <unk w="country"/> with a small <unk w="european"/> market , this is particularly important .

<unk w="however"/> , and most <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of <unk w="all"/> , <unk w="when"/> voices are heard in Europe <unk w=","/> European voices are heard in the world .

We can be proud that <unk w="we"/> have at <unk w="our"/> disposal <unk w="of"/> a unique <unk w="form"/> of collaboration .

It <unk w="is"/> all of <unk w="us"/> to search together for active solutions <unk w="in"/> global <unk w="economic"/> , climate and demographic <unk w="change"/> , the reinforcement of <unk w="social"/> security , the problems <unk w="of"/> migration , and <unk w="in"/> the case of financial <unk w="management"/> , on a worldwide scale .

Latvia now <unk w="has"/> at its disposal new political and economic <unk w="terms"/> , but it must be noted that our nation 's responsibility <unk w="for"/> the <unk w="foreseeable"/> future <unk w="of"/> Europe , a <unk w="long"/> before <unk w=","/> the <unk w="whole"/> of Europe , has also significantly <unk w="increased"/> .

Looking back <unk w="to"/> our <unk w="opinion"/> , <unk w="we"/> must <unk w="also"/> be <unk w="open"/> and own up to mistakes that have <unk w="been"/> committed .

<unk w="the"/> accession to <unk w="the"/> European Union , the Latvian <unk w="of"/> lapsed <unk w="in"/> a sense <unk w="of"/> a ' job well done ' ; <unk w="we"/> had achieved its goal .

We did not recognise that we were only at <unk w="the"/> beginning and not at the end of <unk w="the"/> process .

The European Union offers <unk w="new"/> opportunities , but each nation and <unk w="civil"/> society must grasp <unk w="it"/> by itself .

We in Latvia <unk w="have"/> not grasped all <unk w="these"/> opportunities ; we have not always wisely implemented <unk w="a"/> policy or made use of <unk w="the"/> financial opportunities we <unk w="have"/> been offered .

Our state institutions had to learn how to <unk w="engage"/> in the European <unk w="union"/> .

We have not been sufficiently determined to adopt the <unk w="treaty"/> ; that <unk w="is"/> one of <unk w="the"/> greatest <unk w="problems"/> we have made in the euro integration <unk w="policy"/> , something that is <unk w="still"/> evident today in <unk w="the"/> circumstances of <unk w="the"/> financial <unk w="interests"/> .

<unk w="perhaps"/> even <unk w="the"/> most <unk w="of"/> Eurosceptic must admit that Latvia <unk w="'s"/> membership of the European Union has on the whole been <unk w="done"/> .

Is there anyone in Latvia <unk w="who"/> wants to return to a Europe where <unk w="there"/> are customs barriers <unk w="and"/> nations ?

Is <unk w="there"/> anyone who wants to wait in a queue <unk w="of"/> the border in order to <unk w="build"/> a <unk w="small"/> country ?

Is there anyone who <unk w="wants"/> to return to a world where there <unk w="are"/> restrictions on <unk w="the"/> free <unk w="movement"/> of workers , on their <unk w="side"/> and on their gaining experience ?

Even Eurosceptics <unk w="cannot"/> get used to good things , and become simply sceptics .

Ladies and gentlemen , the deterioration of the situation within the financial <unk w="markets"/> and economy in recent months has irreversibly changed the role and significance <unk w="of"/> national governments <unk w="and"/> economic processes .

Until now , the financial markets were able <unk w="to"/> develop very freely .

We were persuaded that the laws of the market would <unk w="find"/> themselves be <unk w="more"/> efficient in promoting economic development .

We believed that the market alone would <unk w="do"/> everything <unk w="in"/> its place .

What we can see from this global crisis , <unk w="however"/> , is that our financial systems and our economies are <unk w="different"/> from that market , and most important of all , real people are suffering <unk w="from"/> the <unk w="disease"/> .

The <unk w="course"/> of events at the end <unk w="of"/> last year has shown us that it is essential for national governments to <unk w="take"/> a more <unk w="large"/> part <unk w="of"/> the economic process .

<unk w="the"/> previous approach , <unk w="to"/> nodding off at <unk w="the"/> wheel of economic management , <unk w="and"/> irresponsible .

Late enough to still espy the obstacle - the <unk w="european"/> morass - on the road ahead of us , but no <unk w="longer"/> able to avoid it .

In this <unk w="context"/> , a complex approach <unk w="to"/> national , European <unk w="and"/> global level is what is needed .

That will only <unk w="be"/> possible by designing a new architecture and mechanisms for the financial system .

It will <unk w="be"/> vital to supervise the <unk w="treaty"/> strictly , without <unk w="even"/> limiting <unk w="control"/> or <unk w="information"/> processes .

The most difficult challenge will be <unk w="to"/> strike precisely this balance .

<unk w="at"/> the European level , we have a <unk w="good"/> advantage , for we can implement coordinated measures , take united action and achieve a sustainable solution .

It is an important step out <unk w="of"/> the morass <unk w="in"/> which we find ourselves at this time .

I shall spend a little <unk w="more"/> time on national-level solutions .

There is a school of thought which suggests that Latvia is currently undergoing one of the <unk w="most"/> dramatic <unk w="emergency"/> operations of any financial system in modern <unk w="european"/> history .

Currently , Latvia <unk w="are"/> working on measures to stimulate the economy in order to stabilise the <unk w="economy"/> and economic <unk w="development"/> swiftly and effectively .

It is a difficult task , but we shall succeed in overcoming the <unk w="conditions"/> only by seeing a <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> way out of <unk w="it"/> , and not by mistaking <unk w="of"/> solutions for a long-term vision of economic development .

At the end of last year , six political parties represented <unk w="by"/> the Latvian parliament , from both government and opposition , <unk w="and"/> on a common stance of <unk w="respect"/> for the economic stabilisation plan <unk w="set"/> up by the <unk w="irish"/> government .

<unk w="this"/> agreement provides <unk w="for"/> special <unk w="attention"/> to be paid <unk w="for"/> monitoring <unk w="by"/> the loan granted to Latvia is utilised .

The plan defines <unk w="the"/> medium-term priorities <unk w="for"/> Latvia <unk w="'"/> economy : support for exports , the promotion of <unk w="free"/> and fair competition , a significant reduction <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="public"/> deficit in the balance of payments , and the introduction of the euro in <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> .

Accession to the euro area has become one of our nation 's most important <unk w="political"/> goals .

It is <unk w="important"/> for Latvia not <unk w="to"/> be left alone in this situation .

<unk w="we"/> are being <unk w="prepared"/> to <unk w="find"/> this difficult time not only by international financial organisations but also <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="countries"/> of the European Union and by the nations of Europe .

Ladies and gentlemen , each enlargement has not only brought the European Union new Member States , but it has also introduced <unk w="its"/> accents into its agenda , <unk w="in"/> its foreign policy .

Latvia <unk w="'s"/> accession <unk w="to"/> the <unk w="european"/> Union took place at a time when Europe <unk w="accepts"/> Neighbourhood Policy , its goals , principles and implementation <unk w="measures"/> , were being drawn up .

Since that time , there has <unk w="been"/> a particular increase in the European Union 's foreign policy <unk w="principally"/> towards its eastern neighbours .

This has happened thanks to the <unk w="skills"/> and experience of the new Member States .

Latvia has always seen neighbourhood relations in a wider <unk w="context"/> .

<unk w="we"/> will continue to play an active part in the determination and <unk w="development"/> of this policy <unk w="in"/> the future .

This policy is not just a matter of the <unk w="european"/> Union <unk w="'s"/> relations with particular states , that is , with those <unk w="countries"/> with which it shares a land or <unk w="a"/> border .

In the context of this policy , we <unk w="must"/> address the European Union 's place and role in the <unk w="future"/> .

Together <unk w="with"/> other like-minded nations , Latvia has actively encouraged a closer involvement by <unk w="the"/> European Union in its eastern neighbourhood region .

A new political initiative , the ' Eastern Partnership ' has <unk w="brought"/> about , whose <unk w="purpose"/> is <unk w="the"/> reshape <unk w="people"/> 's common neighbourhood <unk w=","/> and adapt it to the specific <unk w="nature"/> of this region , thereby making this process more active , more courageous and <unk w="more"/> ambitious .

Latvia notes with <unk w="all"/> the European Commission <unk w="'s"/> proposals in this regard .

In its practical work , the <unk w="accession"/> Partnership must strengthen the <unk w="political"/> and economic relations between <unk w="the"/> European Union and the states <unk w="of"/> this <unk w="area"/> , and <unk w="to"/> strengthen the <unk w="close"/> cooperation between those <unk w="countries"/> .

In developing the <unk w="euro-mediterranean"/> Partnership , attention must <unk w="be"/> paid to the <unk w="subsidiarity"/> principle , individual assessment and the attitude towards each of the partners .

Each of <unk w="the"/> states is following <unk w="its"/> own path <unk w="to"/> development .

There are <unk w="member"/> states who wish to see themselves <unk w="in"/> the European Union , and <unk w="there"/> are <unk w="member"/> states that have chosen <unk w="these"/> goals for themselves .

Our policy will succeed only if we are able <unk w="to"/> work <unk w="together"/> with all the states of this region , <unk w="and"/> with understanding where necessary .

I <unk w="have"/> received positive signals for extending and deepening cooperation on my visit to the Central Asian nations last October , when I visited Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan and <unk w="korea"/> .

Latvia <unk w="must"/> continue to be an active supporter of Europe 's <unk w="foreign"/> Policy and play an active part in implementing it .

Every European <unk w="union"/> has its <unk w="own"/> experience of <unk w="it"/> and its own opportunities to work <unk w="on"/> our common project for the benefit of the European Union .

Latvia <unk w="in"/> particular contribution <unk w="to"/> the eastern dimension is <unk w="of"/> mutual trust <unk w="whatsoever"/> by our bilateral relations , <unk w="they"/> are rooted in a shared period in history , and the expertise born out of <unk w="our"/> trust .

Latvia <unk w="'s"/> duty is to make <unk w="use"/> of this special circumstance which could be lost within the next 10 years .

After several decades , to eastern eyes , Latvia will be only one of <unk w="the"/> Member <unk w="states"/> of the European <unk w="union"/> , not <unk w="the"/> gateway to Europe .

Making use of these advantages , Latvia will maintain an active political dialogue <unk w="in"/> order to encourage a better understanding <unk w="of"/> the European Union and its values in the neighbouring <unk w="countries"/> and <unk w="to"/> clarify <unk w="the"/> goals <unk w="in"/> the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Eastern Partnership .

That is of mutual <unk w="interest"/> , and we have an opportunity to hear <unk w="the"/> neighbouring states perceive their future relations with <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> .

I am <unk w="sure"/> that Europe <unk w="'s"/> interests would be best <unk w="determined"/> by an <unk w="individual"/> inauguration <unk w="in"/> the Eastern Partnership during the <unk w="french"/> Republic 's Presidency .

Ladies and gentlemen , the question of <unk w="social"/> security has very <unk w="much"/> become topical during the first <unk w="part"/> of <unk w="the"/> Czech Presidency .

The financial <unk w="and"/> economic <unk w="recovery"/> is cyclical <unk w="in"/> its own way .

<unk w="the"/> associated <unk w="with"/> energy <unk w="management"/> and sustainable energy sources <unk w="cannot"/> , however , always <unk w="on"/> Europe <unk w="'s"/> political agenda <unk w="and"/> that of the <unk w="eu"/> .

This <unk w="means"/> that this question cannot be viewed divorced from the <unk w="current"/> situation .

The recent events in <unk w="colombia"/> and the <unk w="situation"/> in Georgia are proof <unk w="of"/> this .

Even quite recently , <unk w="european"/> Union Member States regarded energy <unk w="as"/> an <unk w="agreement"/> to be resolved <unk w="by"/> the <unk w="eu"/> and not at <unk w="the"/> European Union level .

The events of the last <unk w="year"/> in the energy sector , the interruptions to energy supply , the shrinking of energy resources and price <unk w="conditions"/> have helped to create a common understanding in European <unk w="union"/> Member States of <unk w="the"/> need for a common energy policy .

<unk w="in"/> the intersection of energy <unk w="and"/> politics , <unk w="the"/> main task is to secure a regular , sufficient , economic , sustainable and environmentally friendly <unk w="transport"/> supply .

You have to admit that the <unk w="european"/> Union has had only <unk w="a"/> success in this sphere .

On some issues , of <unk w="course"/> the development of an environmentally <unk w="sustainable"/> energy economy is an <unk w="important"/> , <unk w="we"/> have adopted ambitious goals at the European level , which we must now begin to achieve .

On other issues - <unk w="electricity"/> of energy sources at <unk w="european"/> level and <unk w="one"/> of a single energy market - we are right <unk w="at"/> the beginning of our journey .

The events <unk w="over"/> the last <unk w="few"/> days , involving a <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of gas supplies from <unk w="europe"/> , <unk w="the"/> opened eyes to the need to find the quickest <unk w="a"/> solution at pan-European level .

All of us have the <unk w="task"/> of applying this common understanding to create a truly integrated and diversified European energy market .

We must not allow <unk w="our"/> resolve to vanish along with this <unk w="parliament"/> 's snow .

The energy security question can only be <unk w="addressed"/> resolved by an active dialogue with the transit <unk w="of"/> supplier countries <unk w="and"/> energy resources .

The European <unk w="union"/> has the foreign policy instruments to resolve this <unk w="problem"/> .

A further direction where we must make <unk w="our"/> efforts is the integration of the Baltic energy market with the Scandinavian <unk w="and"/> Central <unk w="and"/> energy markets .

Its initiative <unk w="will"/> improve <unk w="social"/> security and <unk w="safety"/> also includes <unk w="the"/> development of the <unk w="colombia"/> plan for the Baltic energy market .

This will <unk w="provide"/> for a progressive integration of the <unk w="member"/> States into the <unk w="new"/> European energy market .

I hold <unk w="parliament"/> 's involvement in the strategic discussions on the Baltic Sea region in high regard .

Sweden will shortly <unk w="have"/> the opportunity to put <unk w="forward"/> into practice <unk w="in"/> its <unk w="economy"/> in <unk w="the"/> second half of this year .

I am convinced <unk w="that"/> strong regions from <unk w="the"/> Mediterranean to the Baltic Sea make for a strong European <unk w="market"/> .

Ladies and gentlemen , the initial aim of the European Union - the security <unk w="and"/> wellbeing of <unk w="the"/> people <unk w="in"/> Europe - has not altered .

What has altered is the <unk w="way"/> in which we must achieve this <unk w="objective"/> .

The <unk w="irish"/> economy is much more closely <unk w="about"/> than it was half a century ago .

At the <unk w="same"/> time , powerful new economic players have appeared on the world scene .

It is only <unk w="a"/> coherent , far-sighted and , most important <unk w="of"/> all , common action by the European Union that we <unk w="all"/> hope not to be the losers <unk w="in"/> this <unk w="truly"/> competitive struggle .

Only together can we <unk w="forget"/> the promises of security and wellbeing for our citizens .

Only thus <unk w="can"/> we attain <unk w="this"/> goal <unk w=","/> which <unk w="the"/> people of our nations have cast their votes , in <unk w="terms"/> of our participation in the <unk w="european"/> Union .

The European Parliament has already shown that it has a broad vision <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="future"/> of the European Union .

<unk w="turkey"/> 's dynamic growth has given Europe <unk w="the"/> opportunity to compete globally .

This growth is Europe <unk w="'s"/> potential , which it <unk w="can"/> exploit , <unk w="so"/> that the Union <unk w="operates"/> , even several decades <unk w="is"/> now , be an <unk w="important"/> economic partner for <unk w="the"/> rapidly growing Asian and Latin <unk w="american"/> economies .

It <unk w=")"/> you yourselves <unk w="in"/> particular , as <unk w="the"/> democratically elected <unk w="president"/> of Europe 's nations , who feel the responsibility for this process most acutely .

<unk w="it"/> is <unk w="almost"/> impossible to overestimate the significance <unk w="of"/> the European Parliament in <unk w="supporting"/> the <unk w="european"/> project nearer to our people and extending <unk w="the"/> democratic legitimacy .

In <unk w="the"/> future , the role of <unk w="the"/> European Parliament will become even <unk w="more"/> important .

It is important to <unk w="engage"/> in <unk w="the"/> multiformity <unk w="biological"/> diversity .

It is important to <unk w="continue"/> working on improving the European <unk w="union"/> .

<unk w="this"/> is a task <unk w="that"/> all Europeans must take on together .

<unk w="it"/> is essential to prevent fragmentation of <unk w="european"/> European Union .

Member States must seek solutions and avoid the development of a <unk w="new"/> approach to the European project .

<unk w="the"/> agreement <unk w="contained"/> in the Council last month for the furtherance of the Lisbon Treaty is welcome .

The <unk w="maastricht"/> Treaty <unk w="is"/> the legal precondition for <unk w="the"/> future fully effective functioning of the <unk w="european"/> Union .

Only by <unk w="highlighting"/> the principles of the Lisbon Treaty into practice <unk w="will"/> we be able fully to <unk w="achieve"/> the positive potential that the new , <unk w="which"/> Europe offers .

How effectively the Lisbon <unk w="summit"/> will work in practice depends on the political <unk w="visibility"/> of the Member States and institutions <unk w="for"/> their <unk w="efforts"/> to unite <unk w="in"/> achieving Europe 's <unk w="citizens"/> .

Ladies and <unk w="gentlemen"/> , <unk w="in"/> 2004 , <unk w="turkey"/> 's goal was membership of the European Union .

Since <unk w="the"/> time , <unk w="we"/> have <unk w="to"/> Latvia 's goals in the context of Europe 's goals .

<unk w="we"/> can no longer consider and perceive ourselves <unk w="away"/> from Europe .

We <unk w="must"/> define and achieve Latvia 's goals only <unk w="because"/> they match Europe 's common vision of the future .

For their part , Europe 's goals are attainable if they correspond <unk w="to"/> the <unk w="interests"/> of every Member <unk w="state"/> .

The European <unk w="union"/> was built <unk w="up"/> must be strengthened on a base of common values .

<unk w="the"/> public discussion can tease out those values that are common <unk w="to"/> all of us .

Only in unison can <unk w="we"/> agree on <unk w="the"/> values that we are going to place <unk w="in"/> those on which the European Union <unk w="is"/> founded .

<unk w="what"/> is the <unk w="generation"/> of all politicians , <unk w="and"/> especially of Europe 's leaders , to define European values and initiate discussion on them .

The post-crisis economic <unk w="situation"/> will have <unk w="come"/> into several economic power centres .

Europe will have the will and the ability to be <unk w="used"/> , for <unk w="the"/> union will afford us the chance to fulfil our tasks .

<unk w="however"/> , the European Union will still be open to all those Europeans <unk w="to"/> accept its values .

<unk w="european"/> unity in diversity will be the <unk w="key"/> to <unk w="the"/> growing importance of Europe 's role <unk w="in"/> the world .

The <unk w="european"/> Union will have expanded , but it will <unk w="not"/> lose the capability of <unk w="community"/> action .

The European Union will <unk w="be"/> able to look after <unk w="their"/> own security and provide for stability in its neighbours .

Education and culture will be the bridge joining the different experiences <unk w="of"/> the European <unk w="union"/> 's <unk w="member"/> States and that will help to regain <unk w="turkey"/> 's leading <unk w="role"/> in <unk w="the"/> world <unk w="and"/> the realms <unk w="of"/> science and culture .

There will no longer be old <unk w=","/> new , <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and large European nations .

<unk w="in"/> Europe , nations <unk w="must"/> be judged according to their achievements , not <unk w="the"/> geographical <unk w="and"/> geopolitical criteria .

Europe will be united , and this unity <unk w="must"/> be secured by powerful regions , <unk w="and"/> while defending <unk w="their"/> own interests will work closely together with others , thereby creating a network <unk w="of"/> wellbeing <unk w="and"/> development throughout Europe .

Every <unk w="farmer"/> will contribute <unk w="to"/> this <unk w=","/> according to its <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> abilities and particular knowledge .

What will <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> Latvia 's role <unk w="in"/> the European Union of 2015 ?

That will be a time <unk w="for"/> Latvia <unk w="which"/> have emerged <unk w="from"/> the crisis .

Latvia 's capital city , Riga , will be one of the <unk w="key"/> centres of <unk w="the"/> Baltic economic region .

Latvia 's <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> will be more balanced , more <unk w="efficient"/> and <unk w="more"/> transformed .

In 2015 , <unk w="in"/> the first <unk w="speaker"/> in the history <unk w="of"/> the independent state , Latvia will be entrusted with <unk w="the"/> questions on <unk w="a"/> European and global scale as the <unk w="individual"/> Member State of <unk w="the"/> European Union .

Our contribution to Europe will be our special <unk w="relationship"/> with the Eastern Partnership nations .

Latvia and our region <unk w="will"/> be the bridge to <unk w="the"/> East , just as the Mediterranean states will join <unk w="the"/> shores of that sea .

Our vision <unk w="is"/> an open Europe and our experience of integration will be the spur to Europe <unk w="'s"/> openness .

Ladies and <unk w="gentlemen"/> , 2015 is not far away ; only six years stand between us .

<unk w="this"/> will grow <unk w="more"/> powerful in <unk w="the"/> economy , welfare and mutual cooperation .

Unity in diversity , development , <unk w="and"/> of values <unk w="and"/> every citizen 's <unk w="party"/> towards his or her nation and for the European family as a whole , that is <unk w="europe"/> 's future .

Ladies <unk w="and"/> gentlemen , Europe 's development and prosperity is the yardstick of <unk w="its"/> success .

I call on you , as <unk w="president"/> of the <unk w="european"/> Parliament , to <unk w="the"/> Europeans ' understanding of our common goals and of how they will affect the life of every <unk w="individual"/> in his <unk w="or"/> her own home .

<unk w="the"/> support of European citizens for the <unk w="citizens"/> of Europe <unk w="in"/> the strongest guarantee of Europe 's future .

I thank <unk w="you"/> , ladies and <unk w="gentlemen"/> , <unk w="for"/> your work in this session .

I <unk w="wish"/> you success in your further work and in <unk w="the"/> next European Parliament elections .

Mr <unk w="president"/> , may I <unk w="congratulate"/> you on <unk w="behalf"/> of the <unk w="european"/> Parliament for your <unk w="support"/> , <unk w="and"/> your European courageousness <unk w="and"/> for your European determination .

<unk w="we"/> were of course <unk w="shocked"/> to hear that you value the European Parliament , and rightly so .

I still remember very <unk w="well"/> that , during accession negotiations in the second half of the 1990s , Latvia , Lithuania and Slovakia <unk w=","/> initially excluded .

It was the <unk w="european"/> Parliament that called <unk w="upon"/> the governments to include Latvia , Lithuania and Slovakia in the negotiations .

As a result , Latvia , Lithuania and Slovakia were able to <unk w="inform"/> members of the <unk w="european"/> Union on 1 May 2004 .

You <unk w="asked"/> the energy question <unk w="and"/> I shall reply <unk w="to"/> you very briefly .

We have a very <unk w="high"/> Commissioner , a <unk w="word"/> of yours , Andris Piebalgs , who <unk w="committed"/> himself admirably last week and during <unk w="the"/> gas dispute with Russia and <unk w="russia"/> , but especially with Russia .

I should like to thank <unk w="mr"/> Piebalgs for his work in the presence of his President .

Mr President , my closing remark is <unk w="this"/> : you spoke about how you are learning <unk w="and"/> Latvia is learning .

Yet even those who belonged to the European Community , to the <unk w="european"/> Union , from the beginning are <unk w="far"/> from you and your historical experiences .

If we are prepared to listen to each other and to learn <unk w="from"/> each other , <unk w="and"/> we shall all <unk w="have"/> the better for <unk w="it"/> .

<unk w="on"/> the basis of our common values , we <unk w="are"/> strong , democratic and free .

Thank you , President Zatlers , it was a joy to welcome you here <unk w="today"/> .

( CS ) Madam President , I <unk w="support"/> the compromise , which <unk w="will"/> force governments of EU countries <unk w="to"/> create a timetable and draw up action plans <unk w="to"/> limit risks from the use of pesticides .

The restrictions on spraying by aircraft will surely be <unk w="borne"/> by EU citizens , as will the <unk w="best"/> zones for protecting drinking water <unk w="and"/> aquatic organisms .

I voted for the <unk w="resolution"/> because it is in line with my views on health protection .

Madam President , I <unk w="voted"/> in favour of this compromise because it makes sense that we <unk w="make"/> sustainable use of pesticides .

I <unk w="think"/> the real problem is that there are <unk w="two"/> different rules across Member States : some countries apply training <unk w="and"/> education of operators in a very strict way and , therefore , <unk w="the"/> good sustainable use of pesticides , but not all countries <unk w="do"/> so .

I <unk w="welcome"/> this piece <unk w="of"/> legislation will make <unk w="it"/> appropriate <unk w="and"/> we have <unk w="common"/> standards across <unk w="the"/> European Union .

<unk w="it"/> is good both for those who <unk w="have"/> sprays <unk w="blame"/> for those who come into contact with them .

I think <unk w="we"/> are <unk w="talking"/> about a very sensible package <unk w="and"/> , so I was very happy <unk w="to"/> support <unk w="this"/> , <unk w="and"/> I congratulate the rapporteur .

There is no question that <unk w="we"/> need a regulatory system for pesticides .

<unk w="the"/> Klaß <unk w="also"/> extends the range of controls <unk w="and"/> limits the use of PPPs to essential <unk w="information"/> .

<unk w="however"/> , while there was a very vexed debate on hazard-versus-risk on the Breyer <unk w="report"/> , I have <unk w="therefore"/> felt that this issue is <unk w="not"/> suitable to <unk w="make"/> actual use as distinct from placing <unk w="on"/> the market - in other words , this report .

A <unk w="wide"/> range of common products can be <unk w="restricted"/> if the handling and usage instructions are ignored .

<unk w="so"/> on the <unk w="subject"/> in itself <unk w="is"/> not a risk to <unk w="the"/> consumer , <unk w="the"/> environment or the user of such products .

Pesticides <unk w="is"/> only hazardous if the <unk w="consumer"/> does not know what he or <unk w="he"/> is doing , <unk w="because"/> the application equipment is <unk w="necessary"/> , if the aquatic environment is <unk w="concerned"/> or <unk w="when"/> they are improperly stored and <unk w="the"/> part <unk w="of"/> an integrated pest-management plan .

The <unk w="objectives"/> of quantitative use reduction <unk w="in"/> careful management , as less <unk w="to"/> spraying with higher concentration of pesticide could result .

At the end <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="day"/> , these <unk w="funds"/> must <unk w="be"/> used to the <unk w="same"/> extent possible , as every <unk w="farmer"/> knows .

( CS ) Madam President , I would like to respond again to yesterday 's <unk w="urgent"/> debate .

I supported the new regulation <unk w=","/> in my <unk w="view"/> it constitutes a tool for pursuing new and <unk w="concrete"/> alternatives for protecting plants .

I consider the <unk w="mutual"/> recognition <unk w="and"/> approved <unk w=","/> according to geographical zones to <unk w="be"/> a positive <unk w="assessment"/> for our Parliament .

The preparation of a list of banned <unk w="substances"/> is also a <unk w="step"/> forward - <unk w="to"/> include carcinogens , genotoxic substances and also substances with <unk w="pollution"/> and <unk w="negative"/> effects - and <unk w="is"/> based on scientific knowledge .

As <unk w="the"/> Commissioner said <unk w="earlier"/> , it seems that it applies <unk w="to"/> a relatively small percentage of the substances still used today .

I would like to mention that we must apply these requirements strictly to imported <unk w="products"/> as well .

Commissioner , I also wanted to <unk w="congratulate"/> a <unk w="debate"/> on other reports but I was not given the floor .

These reports have already <unk w="been"/> used for <unk w="research"/> purposes or they <unk w="have"/> already been debated <unk w="and"/> , so I believe they will be adopted in <unk w="its"/> written form .

Since I was a child there <unk w="has"/> been one <unk w="point"/> that I hate : peas .

<unk w="but"/> I have the <unk w="honour"/> to represent Britain 's largest growing pea-growing area , which <unk w="has"/> given me a huge problem with <unk w="the"/> Breyer report .

I agree with the <unk w="presentation"/> of the legislation to promote the <unk w="protection"/> of our environment , <unk w="public"/> health <unk w="of"/> us as individuals , but it really potentially threatens a <unk w="large"/> agricultural industry in <unk w="the"/> region .

After much soul-searching , I have abstained , but I wish <unk w="to"/> make it <unk w="clear"/> that I think our legislative <unk w="proposals"/> in this <unk w="matter"/> was <unk w="done"/> .

We had <unk w="very"/> much information <unk w="before"/> the end - <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and otherwise - that I , and I think many others , would have welcomed the <unk w="outcome"/> of a <unk w="second"/> reading , or of conciliation , <unk w="to"/> make sure that <unk w="we"/> have protected all interests .

Madam <unk w="president"/> , I too <unk w="find"/> this a particularly difficult decision .

I felt <unk w="that"/> the report was , in general , very well-balanced and constructive , and it was certainly designed to ensure a <unk w="high"/> level of <unk w="protection"/> for human health , animal health and <unk w="the"/> environment .

However , I have concerns about the situation where <unk w="we"/> are making decisions for approval of a particular <unk w="system"/> based on whether that substance is a <unk w="question"/> or <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , and we are not taking possible <unk w="this"/> into account .

I think we need impact <unk w="assessment"/> conducted on a <unk w="daily"/> basis .

<unk w="one"/> of my concerns is <unk w="concerned"/> , when I talk to citizens about the EU , <unk w="one"/> of the issues they constantly raise with me is that , at <unk w="last"/> , the EU 's legislation <unk w="is"/> not always proportionate .

While I believe there is flexibility in this report , I <unk w="think"/> we needed a <unk w="little"/> more , but crucially we needed <unk w="for"/> scientific evidence to support the case .

Yes , there is the precautionary principle , and we <unk w="need"/> to <unk w="be"/> mindful of this , but <unk w="we"/> also need to <unk w="be"/> evidence-based , <unk w="and"/> I <unk w="would"/> have liked a little more evidence in this matter .

Madam President , <unk w="an"/> efficient and effective <unk w="use"/> of pesticides is a <unk w="priority"/> .

Whilst the <unk w="protection"/> of the environment and safeguarding of public health go hand-in-hand , I <unk w="think"/> we have to <unk w="meet"/> the needs of <unk w="consumers"/> and producers .

Whilst I <unk w="endorse"/> the aims <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="swoboda"/> report to <unk w="the"/> red tape , I am not able to support <unk w="it"/> .

I have <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> with a number of experts and farmers and NFU representatives <unk w="of"/> my West Midlands constituency who all have <unk w="serious"/> reservations about <unk w="the"/> effects that this report will <unk w="focus"/> on crop yields .

<unk w="the"/> biggest <unk w="problem"/> is <unk w="that"/> there has not been a <unk w="real"/> impact <unk w="both"/> by the <unk w="commission"/> and there is no clear indication of what this report <unk w="would"/> mean for agriculture .

<unk w="as"/> a <unk w="result"/> of rising food prices around the world , I do not think <unk w="that"/> now is the time for us to have a knee-jerk reaction to introduce measures which may have <unk w="negative"/> effects on food <unk w="safety"/> .

That is <unk w="why"/> my <unk w="report"/> introduced an amendment for a thorough and long overdue impact assessment .

Madam President , like other colleagues , I should like <unk w="to"/> say that this was a very difficult dossier .

<unk w="as"/> Diana Wallis <unk w="is"/> concerned about peas , <unk w="i"/> can imagine that , in Ireland , potatoes were certainly <unk w="not"/> our menu <unk w="placed"/> on <unk w="the"/> agenda .

Overall , however , I believe <unk w="that"/> what we <unk w="agree"/> on is a much better proposal <unk w="tax"/> package than the <unk w="next"/> one <unk w="on"/> the table - and I compliment those who <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> on it .

Let me say a <unk w="few"/> things about this - and I will end up with the key point .

I <unk w="believe"/> we are <unk w="not"/> in a position where farmers need <unk w="a"/> lobby <unk w="and"/> agrochemical industry to produce safer alternatives so that they can continue <unk w="to"/> produce food , and I think <unk w="that"/> much energy should go into that <unk w=","/> as has <unk w="been"/> heretofore .

<unk w="when"/> it comes to food imports , the Commission need <unk w="to"/> address the genuine concerns of EU farmers and producers <unk w="and"/> they will be banned <unk w="by"/> using certain substances <unk w="from"/> third countries continue to use them .

We need an explanation of that in order to bring farmers with <unk w="it"/> .

Madam President , I <unk w="voted"/> against this simply <unk w="because"/> the <unk w="situation"/> has been hijacked in effect by <unk w="the"/> Committee on the <unk w="environment"/> , <unk w="public"/> Health <unk w=","/> Food Safety and Commissioners .

The rapporteurs yesterday <unk w="talks"/> about standardisation , and yet this <unk w="is"/> allegedly a Union of diversity .

If there were one area where judgement , discretion and <unk w="transparency"/> are needed , it <unk w="is"/> perhaps this .

This was essentially <unk w="an"/> agricultural issue , but the Danish <unk w="reason"/> for <unk w="it"/> was nowhere to <unk w="be"/> seen at any time , and that is a disgrace .

The reason , of course , is because <unk w="of"/> a conflict of interests since the Danes fail to process their drinking water after <unk w="it"/> comes out of the ground .

Farmers in my <unk w="parts"/> of the world feel totally let down and <unk w="organise"/> insulted <unk w="on"/> the fact that there are some assumptions here that they do not <unk w="know"/> what they are doing , and they need <unk w="to"/> be told .

<unk w="but"/> you have <unk w="not"/> yet another group to those in <unk w="the"/> UK who <unk w="have"/> loathe the European Union <unk w="is"/> interference .

Madam President , <unk w="such"/> claims have been made and fears expressed <unk w="by"/> all sides <unk w="of"/> this <unk w="debate"/> .

It is <unk w="therefore"/> been difficult to distinguish <unk w="between"/> from <unk w="now"/> and to come <unk w="up"/> a decision on <unk w="time"/> to vote .

While I recognise <unk w="the"/> concerns of the soft fruit industry , the potato industry <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="young"/> farmers <unk w="in"/> Ireland <unk w="would"/> have <unk w="said"/> to me about this , I <unk w="support"/> the compromise .

I feel <unk w="the"/> improvements made were worth our support , <unk w="even"/> though I still have some <unk w="reservations"/> .

I <unk w="commend"/> the <unk w="same"/> as , in my opinion , <unk w="the"/> worst of <unk w="such"/> outcomes would <unk w="have"/> to <unk w="do"/> this <unk w="approach"/> to conciliation .

The five-year derogation , renewable <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> necessary <unk w="an"/> essential plant <unk w="management"/> projects , is an important safety <unk w="net"/> and <unk w="it"/> encourages the agrochemical industry to <unk w="produce"/> and produce alternatives .

Madam President , I think that , when one considers the <unk w="european"/> project , there is a dialectic <unk w="at"/> its heart .

<unk w="we"/> talk about <unk w="copyright"/> , yet we ignore the democratic <unk w="doubts"/> as expressed in referenda <unk w="in"/> France , the Netherlands and Ireland .

We talk about food security , yet we vote on a report which has <unk w="the"/> potential to <unk w="improve"/> food production in the <unk w="european"/> Union .

We talk <unk w="of"/> helping <unk w="consumers"/> and farmers <unk w="in"/> poorer countries , <unk w="and"/> there will now be , <unk w="as"/> a result of <unk w="the"/> vote , a call to <unk w="ban"/> imports from farmers who have used pesticides that <unk w="are"/> now banned <unk w="by"/> the European Union .

I <unk w="therefore"/> have a <unk w="surprise"/> to my colleagues in Parliament <unk w="and"/> to the Commission : <unk w="commissioner"/> , let <unk w="us"/> think in future about <unk w="the"/> unintended consequences of <unk w="european"/> legislation .

I agree with <unk w="mrs"/> Wallis <unk w="in"/> the legislative process and <unk w="that"/> there should have <unk w="been"/> a third reading .

I agree <unk w="this"/> has been rushed <unk w=","/> and I think we all agree that there has <unk w="been"/> an <unk w="environmental"/> impact assessment <unk w="on"/> a scientific basis .

Madam President , I tried <unk w="to"/> undermine the compromise by voting against those parts <unk w="of"/> this report .

I will explain why <unk w="to"/> reading out a <unk w="flight"/> to <unk w="report"/> from James Mowbray , <unk w="which"/> is a farmer near Skegness in my region .

He said , ' I have <unk w="already"/> been involved in <unk w="the"/> application <unk w="of"/> crop protection products for over 40 <unk w="years"/> .

I have always applied products with a sensitive <unk w="approach"/> to other human beings as well as wildlife .

I <unk w="have"/> incurred no apparent <unk w="as"/> to my health or the wellbeing of the environment .

I therefore find it distressing that the possible <unk w="use"/> of many products , <unk w="including"/> the <unk w="european"/> fungicides , is based on less than scientific arguments and will make my <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> not particularly viable <unk w="to"/> reduce the <unk w="volume"/> of home-produced food ' .

I received <unk w="some"/> comments from him and <unk w="the"/> literally <unk w="out"/> of other people , from Empire World Trade , based <unk w="on"/> Spalding in Lincolnshire , <unk w="the"/> Manby in Parker Farms <unk w="and"/> Leicester , John <unk w="aznar"/> , who <unk w="are"/> based in Nottinghamshire , <unk w="of"/> Reading and hundreds more names .

Madam President , now that <unk w="the"/> vote is over and the <unk w="decisions"/> have been made , I would like <unk w="to"/> come <unk w="back"/> to something <unk w="which"/> ran <unk w="in"/> the debate <unk w=","/> and in the committee .

This was the <unk w="direct"/> mistrust of <unk w="terrorism"/> and an assumption by <unk w="ensuring"/> that farmers are somehow enemies of health and the environment .

In <unk w="my"/> experience this is the opposite of the truth .

Farmers <unk w="in"/> Ireland are , <unk w="we"/> have been , stewards who for <unk w="thousands"/> of years have <unk w="come"/> and preserved the environment , keeping <unk w="them"/> alive , clean and productive .

Similarly , <unk w="we"/> have also been <unk w="the"/> basis of <unk w="public"/> health .

They produce the good food that is the <unk w="cause"/> of our good health .

I <unk w="would"/> urge you to renew our faith in our farmers , who are doing their <unk w="right"/> to feed us <unk w="in"/> very difficult situations , circumstances of <unk w="conflict"/> , pest and , of course , EU policy .

in writing . - We have just <unk w="worked"/> on <unk w="the"/> agreement for civil aviation safety .

Although travel by air is one of the safest <unk w="means"/> of travel , however , one can <unk w="only"/> take measures which are too safe .

Since the <unk w="current"/> terror <unk w="passed"/> on the twin towers , innumerable <unk w="these"/> measures have been <unk w="put"/> in place .

Just like the <unk w="ministry"/> of safety one can never be too secure .

Indeed , <unk w="it"/> is when <unk w="we"/> feel <unk w="to"/> secure that terror strikes again .

Of course , one has to <unk w="strike"/> a balance <unk w="between"/> civil <unk w="freedom"/> and rights and security measures ; however , <unk w="when"/> it comes down <unk w="to"/> a choice one has <unk w="to"/> prioritise .

For instance , <unk w="there"/> has been a substantial deal <unk w="of"/> opposition to the <unk w="outbreak"/> of passenger lists on the basis <unk w="of"/> data protection .

<unk w="but"/> surely such security measures will enable an in-depth <unk w="and"/> not possible <unk w="by"/> the frontiers .

Innocent civilians are purposely targeted and the civilians <unk w="of"/> certain countries preselected .

In <unk w="as"/> an environment surely we <unk w="must"/> not <unk w="have"/> these <unk w="questions"/> to abstain from doing all that <unk w="it"/> is possible to <unk w="reconcile"/> the interests of its citizens .

I voted in <unk w="favour"/> of this report because the aviation industry in <unk w="europe"/> will benefit directly too .

The negotiated agreement reflects <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and large the structure of a conventional <unk w="audiovisual"/> safety agreement ; it is <unk w="based"/> on mutual <unk w="support"/> in each other 's systems and on the comparison of <unk w="the"/> differences .

<unk w="this"/> entails obligations and methods <unk w="of"/> cooperation between <unk w="operators"/> and importing authorities .

However , the <unk w="aim"/> of achieving this objective , namely cooperation <unk w="and"/> mutual acceptance of each <unk w="country"/> 's <unk w="outstanding"/> findings in the areas of airworthiness and maintenance , are <unk w="carried"/> out in the annexes to the agreement , unlike in conventional agreements , where <unk w="these"/> measures are usually set out <unk w="in"/> separate non-binding agreements at civil aviation authority level .

<unk w="the"/> annexes broadly reflect the content of <unk w="the"/> Community 's <unk w="community"/> Rules on <unk w="transfers"/> ( <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> Regulation <unk w="no"/> 1702 / 2003 ) <unk w="on"/> maintenance ( Commission Regulation No 2042 / 2003 ) to be modified by the <unk w="commission"/> based <unk w="on"/> a decision of the Bilateral Oversight <unk w="agreement"/> .

The origins of <unk w="the"/> aviation agreements <unk w="between"/> the European Community and the United <unk w="nations"/> ( <unk w="the"/> ) lie in <unk w="they"/> are based <unk w="on"/> the liberalisation of air transport .

These agreements established <unk w="at"/> EU level ( or rather , <unk w="by"/> the European Community - the only body that <unk w="exists"/> in law - and its single Community <unk w="dominant"/> , which <unk w="we"/> intend to fully liberalise ) are meant <unk w="to"/> prevail over <unk w="the"/> bilateral agreements established between various Member States and the US .

As <unk w="the"/> other resolutions previously adopted <unk w="by"/> the European Parliament , <unk w="i"/> would highlight that we are obviously <unk w="the"/> first <unk w="to"/> be interested in ensuring a ' high level of civil aviation safety ' and <unk w="workers"/> ' to minimize <unk w="real"/> burdens on the aviation industry and operators from redundant regulatory oversight ' .

However , we must safeguard two <unk w="fundamental"/> aspects : ( 1 ) the objective and presumed basis of these processes <unk w="will"/> not be to create and facilitate the conditions for increasing the liberalisation of air transport , through the harmonisation of standards ; ( 2 ) these processes must not promote harmonisation through a <unk w="series"/> of safety <unk w="standards"/> and rules , in particular where , <unk w="on"/> safety , <unk w="and"/> of burdens <unk w="and"/> liberalisation are <unk w="taken"/> together , it is profit <unk w="and"/> concentration <unk w="to"/> prevail .

We believe <unk w="that"/> air transport must <unk w="be"/> defended <unk w="by"/> a public service , provided by <unk w="private"/> companies in each country , which guarantee quality and safety in <unk w="public"/> services provided to citizens .

I agree in principle <unk w="mr"/> Paolo Costa 's report on civil aviation .

It is important for the EU and the US to agree on a common line with the help <unk w="of"/> this <unk w="directive"/> .

However , <unk w="it"/> is vital in this <unk w="new"/> partnership that we are real partners , not just on paper .

<unk w="it"/> must be found to which both parties <unk w="should"/> adhere .

<unk w="whatever"/> the <unk w="availability"/> of contempt on <unk w="the"/> part of either the EU <unk w="and"/> the US , a rescindable variation in the <unk w="future"/> will be <unk w="used"/> .

I voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a Council <unk w="decision"/> on the conclusion of an Agreement between <unk w="the"/> European Community and the United States <unk w="of"/> America on cooperation in the regulation of civil aviation safety .

I think that <unk w="the"/> objectives <unk w="of"/> the agreement , namely facilitation <unk w="of"/> trade in the goods <unk w="and"/> services covered by the agreement , <unk w="the"/> limitation of <unk w="the"/> duplication of assessments , tests and controls to significant regulatory differences and <unk w="monitoring"/> of the certification system of <unk w="a"/> party to check conformity with the requirements of <unk w="the"/> other party are <unk w="two"/> objectives .

I <unk w="believe"/> that the reliance on mutual <unk w="understanding"/> of the other party 's systems will favour the implementation of <unk w="this"/> agreement .

As the <unk w="european"/> Parliament 's rapporteur <unk w=","/> the <unk w="annual"/> report on the expansion of the European Aviation Safety Agency <unk w="("/> ( <unk w="b"/> ) powers , I welcome the negotiated agreement with the United States on <unk w="the"/> mutual acceptance <unk w="of"/> civil <unk w="aviation"/> safety certificates .

This <unk w="therefore"/> marks <unk w="an"/> important step in expanding transatlantic cooperation , which <unk w="is"/> a <unk w="good"/> objective of the Group <unk w="of"/> the European People <unk w="'s"/> Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats .

It <unk w="provides"/> sound conditions for boosting trade in goods and services <unk w="in"/> the civil <unk w="aviation"/> sector between the <unk w="european"/> Union and <unk w="the"/> United States , which undoubtedly benefits Europe .

The agreement offers enhanced <unk w="cooperation"/> as regards <unk w="trade"/> and reinforcement of the compatibility of <unk w="noise"/> , components and aircraft with the increased demands of protecting the environment .

In these conditions , <unk w="we"/> can hope that the European Single <unk w="market"/> principles will <unk w="be"/> extended in the future to apply to transatlantic <unk w="cooperation"/> and that cooperation will be <unk w="used"/> in <unk w="the"/> field <unk w="of"/> research , <unk w="as"/> well as <unk w="the"/> implementation of new technologies <unk w="in"/> this field , based on <unk w="cooperation"/> between SESAR and NextGen .

I <unk w="hope"/> that this <unk w="directive"/> will facilitate in <unk w="the"/> long term the mutually <unk w="possible"/> extension of the <unk w="legal"/> framework between the EASA <unk w="and"/> the FAA , from <unk w="the"/> airlines , <unk w="the"/> aviation industry <unk w="is"/> , more <unk w="importantly"/> , passengers will directly benefit .

The future of the external transport <unk w="sector"/> requires good <unk w="cooperation"/> between the European Community and the United States .

As a result , one <unk w="of"/> the fundamental points of this cooperation agreement on the regulation of civil <unk w="aviation"/> safety is mutual <unk w="support"/> in each other 's systems and <unk w="in"/> comparison <unk w="of"/> regulatory differences .

The objective of this agreement <unk w="is"/> to <unk w="free"/> trade in goods <unk w="and"/> services in <unk w="the"/> aviation <unk w="sector"/> , by limiting <unk w="as"/> much as possible <unk w="and"/> duplication of <unk w="analysis"/> , tests and controls to significant regulatory differences between the two parties .

<unk w="i"/> therefore believe that a <unk w="solution"/> is <unk w="being"/> created <unk w="and"/> will work smoothly on a daily basis and which will allow technical issues arising from its implementation to be solved through a system of continual cooperation and consultation .

<unk w="this"/> agreement is another fundamental step in the external <unk w="policy"/> of the European transport <unk w="policy"/> , <unk w="which"/> is why I voted in favour of this <unk w="report"/> .

Madam President , <unk w="ladies"/> and gentlemen , I would like to state that I <unk w="am"/> in favour of Mr Costa 's report <unk w="on"/> the conclusion of the agreement between the European <unk w="union"/> and the <unk w="united"/> States of America on cooperation in the regulation of civil aviation <unk w="industry"/> , <unk w="as"/> set <unk w="out"/> in the proposal <unk w="for"/> a Council <unk w="decision"/> .

I concur with <unk w="the"/> rapporteur in considering <unk w="that"/> Parliament <unk w="should"/> declare itself <unk w="in"/> favour of <unk w="the"/> conclusion of the agreement because this would clearly streamline the trade <unk w="and"/> goods <unk w="and"/> services between the parties <unk w="and"/> the airworthiness and <unk w="the"/> sector , avoiding the redundant duplication of <unk w="freight"/> and <unk w="not"/> on compliance with safety requirements , which until <unk w="we"/> have had <unk w="to"/> be repeated even if they <unk w="are"/> very similar to <unk w="one"/> another .

I believe , <unk w="however"/> , that <unk w="the"/> agreement should be applied provisionally at first , so that we can identify any practical and implementation difficulties <unk w="and"/> remove <unk w=","/> before proceeding <unk w="the"/> final <unk w="decision"/> .

I voted in favour of the <unk w="communication"/> on the common system of taxation applicable to mergers , divisions , partial <unk w="use"/> , transfers of assets and exchanges of shares concerning companies of different Member States as these <unk w="commercial"/> transactions result in fundamental <unk w="rights"/> to commercial <unk w="companies"/> ' <unk w="s"/> status .

The European Union also needs to take <unk w="the"/> necessary <unk w="measures"/> to provide uniform , harmonised but effective regulation .

I <unk w="have"/> supported <unk w="it"/> because I am a <unk w="shame"/> and I will continue to support in the European Parliament every effort made to harmonise and codify at European level fiscal , economic , civil and criminal regulations .

I voted in <unk w="favour"/> of this report as the Rules of Procedure <unk w="and"/> the Court of First Instance <unk w=","/> any provision as to the language <unk w="used"/> to be used in appeal <unk w=")"/> ( against decisions of the Civil Service <unk w="broadcasting"/> ) .

<unk w="it"/> is , in <unk w="fact"/> , <unk w="an"/> equivalent to Article 110 of the Rules of Procedure of <unk w="the"/> Court <unk w="of"/> Justice .

Madam President , following the last armed conflict <unk w="in"/> the Balkans , European states <unk w="of"/> widely differing <unk w="views"/> on the subject .

However , by its active engagement in the <unk w="domain"/> which existed , <unk w="the"/> EU <unk w="considers"/> that the Balkans <unk w="is"/> an <unk w="enlarged"/> region for us and are an integral <unk w="part"/> of Europe .

We <unk w="are"/> therefore obliged to <unk w="help"/> these countries in their <unk w="attempts"/> to achieve stability and full <unk w="employment"/> .

I endorsed the Belder report because it underlines <unk w="the"/> need to assist the Balkan states , while treating them <unk w="as"/> individual , <unk w="social"/> partners .

Furthermore , it <unk w="is"/> good that <unk w="the"/> report underlines the need to establish a <unk w="common"/> energy policy .

The <unk w="number"/> of sources is <unk w="therefore"/> needed , and this would <unk w="certainly"/> not <unk w="be"/> the EU , <unk w="but"/> the whole <unk w="of"/> Europe .

<unk w="in"/> writing . - The report <unk w="by"/> Mr Belder considers the current situation of the European Union 's <unk w="political"/> and economic relations with this increasingly stable region , <unk w="and"/> many countries hold candidateship for <unk w="eu"/> membership .

The role of the EU as a major partner for the area <unk w=","/> maintaining trade <unk w="and"/> economic relations while pushing for a stable , lasting <unk w="peace"/> in the area is a very important one .

The EU 's strength as an <unk w="economic"/> partner , but also as a model for a strong <unk w="european"/> society , government and dynamic institutions , should be used to push for the development of <unk w="the"/> region .

A threefold and differentiated <unk w="approach"/> , taking into account <unk w="the"/> relative differences between countries in <unk w="the"/> region as well as association agreements and <unk w="financial"/> support , provides a clear <unk w="answer"/> to <unk w="the"/> issues of <unk w="fisheries"/> and shore up intensive regional and <unk w="local"/> economic cooperation .

<unk w="as"/> a means of <unk w="ensuring"/> a lasting peace and promoting the ideals to <unk w="which"/> we <unk w="are"/> all committed , I support Mr Belder 's report .

I know the <unk w="annual"/> report only deals with the economic and commercial relationships with the Western <unk w="balkans"/> and the evident need for the European Union to assist in <unk w="the"/> reconstruction , in the economic , legal , political and social fields .

I am surprised , though , that , <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="fact"/> that this aid , as well as the accession processes , <unk w="to"/> be differentiated and <unk w="extended"/> to each country , the <unk w="commission"/> does <unk w="not"/> really take into account the specific situation of <unk w="the"/> country .

Above all , <unk w="this"/> Parliament , always quick to condemn violations of <unk w="human"/> rights around the world or <unk w="the"/> demand ' human <unk w="beings"/> ' clauses in international <unk w="peace"/> agreements , has achieved the master stroke of voting for a report on <unk w="the"/> Balkans without once mentioning <unk w="the"/> dramatic and inadmissible situation <unk w="in"/> the Serb populations in Kosovo , who have <unk w="been"/> pariahs <unk w="to"/> the historical land of their fathers .

Meanwhile , <unk w="the"/> congratulates <unk w=","/> on <unk w="the"/> hundreds <unk w="of"/> millions of euros given to the authorities who provoke , organise or tolerate this situation .

The consolidation of economic relations with the Western Balkans is of immense importance both to <unk w="the"/> EU and to <unk w="the"/> Western <unk w="countries"/> .

I therefore <unk w="welcome"/> the fact <unk w="that"/> the European Parliament is working intensively on this issue and that we adopted the Belder report today .

In <unk w="view"/> of the <unk w="fact"/> that the future <unk w="of"/> the countries of the <unk w="western"/> Balkans lies with the EU , their economic and political rapprochement to the EU is very important .

In order to tie these countries to the EU in the long <unk w="term"/> , <unk w="the"/> development of <unk w="the"/> market economies and regional cooperation <unk w="must"/> be fostered .

That is why constructive and positive signals from the <unk w="european"/> Parliament <unk w="is"/> also important .

It is in the interests of the EU to champion the <unk w="peace"/> of <unk w="the"/> stability , <unk w="social"/> security and <unk w="in"/> good framework conditions <unk w="in"/> these countries for foreign investment .

The Belder report underlines the fact that the level of economic <unk w="growth"/> depends on progress in each <unk w="individual"/> country .

Moreover , it should <unk w="be"/> the EU 's objective <unk w="to"/> diversify the <unk w="various"/> economies of the countries of <unk w="the"/> Western Balkans .

I <unk w="am"/> convinced that a positive development in economic <unk w="relations"/> between the <unk w="union"/> and the Western Balkans will be of benefit to <unk w="third"/> countries on the continent of <unk w="colombia"/> and I await <unk w="the"/> implementation of our proposals with anticipation .

<unk w="mr"/> President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of the report <unk w="by"/> Mr <unk w="lipietz"/> on trade and economic relations with the Western Balkans .

I <unk w="agree"/> with my fellow Member in <unk w="saying"/> that the European Union has a vital part to <unk w="play"/> in the process of economic and political <unk w="integration"/> of countries <unk w="in"/> the Western <unk w="balkans"/> area , <unk w="have"/> a <unk w="view"/> to their membership <unk w="of"/> the European Union , <unk w="particularly"/> in terms of stabilising the political <unk w="situation"/> and secondly in economic and trade <unk w="matters"/> .

I would nevertheless like to emphasise <unk w="the"/> need for the Union <unk w="to"/> conduct an in-depth analysis of the situation with regard to respect for human rights and <unk w="democratic"/> principles within each country .

I <unk w="am"/> in <unk w="addition"/> to <unk w="parliament"/> and <unk w="the"/> numerous <unk w="countries"/> expatriates <unk w="will"/> continue <unk w="to"/> be <unk w="completely"/> discriminated against in that country , despite Croatia 's official application for admission to <unk w="the"/> EU .

<unk w="this"/> aspect <unk w="is"/> , in my opinion , at odds with the situation of Serbia , a country that has only been granted the status of <unk w="the"/> candidate and <unk w="in"/> which <unk w="the"/> Union <unk w="should"/> be more open <unk w="than"/> it has been until now .

I <unk w="voted"/> for <unk w="the"/> report <unk w="on"/> trade and <unk w="economic"/> relations with the <unk w="western"/> Balkans as the motion <unk w="for"/> a European <unk w="parliament"/> resolution also includes the opinion of <unk w="the"/> Committee on Foreign Affairs <unk w="and"/> that of the <unk w="committee"/> on Regional Development of <unk w="which"/> I am a member .

<unk w="economic"/> growth and development in the Western Balkans region <unk w="to"/> provide the <unk w="need"/> for <unk w="such"/> partnerships with the <unk w="eu"/> 's eastern Member States , <unk w="and"/> ultimately includes Romania <unk w="too"/> .

<unk w="at"/> the <unk w="same"/> time , linking the economic and trade policies of <unk w="the"/> countries in the Western Balkans to the European Union 's policy will <unk w="support"/> the stabilisation and association agreements signed between the EU and these <unk w="countries"/> .

I voted in favour of this <unk w="resolution"/> because economic stability may also lead to political stability in this <unk w="area"/> , which has <unk w="been"/> particularly troubled over the years .

<unk w="the"/> EU should use all available means in order to motivate the Western Balkans <unk w=","/> and persuade it to carry out essential reforms .

The expansion of regional <unk w="development"/> cooperation appears to be especially <unk w="important"/> in this <unk w="area"/> , as also is the prospect of membership <unk w="of"/> states in the <unk w="eu"/> .

Extensive and stable economic contacts between particular countries would lead to specific economic integration , which would definitely <unk w="be"/> to limit the <unk w="types"/> of conflict in the future .

The Balkans have already made huge advances on <unk w="the"/> road to rapprochement with the EU , but the prospect of accession will most certainly <unk w="member"/> states <unk w="to"/> continue their <unk w="position"/> at <unk w="present"/> with the Community .

I would like to emphasise , however , that alongside instruments of economic support , initiatives which <unk w="help"/> to integrate <unk w="civil"/> society with the EU are equally significant .

<unk w="hence"/> the introduction of changes , <unk w="which"/> should be as far-reaching <unk w="as"/> possible and which would make the movement of people easier , is very important , as also is broad support for the region 's young <unk w="farmers"/> .

Only if the people <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="palestinians"/> feel that they have equal rights with the other citizens <unk w="of"/> Europe will we <unk w="be"/> able to say that we have achieved success .

I totally agree <unk w="with"/> what Mr <unk w="dupuis"/> had <unk w="to"/> say and with his <unk w="question"/> on how <unk w="to"/> improve trade and economic relations with the Western Balkans .

The EU has a key <unk w="role"/> to play in the recovery of that region .

<unk w="the"/> stabilisation <unk w="and"/> association <unk w="agreements"/> , the trade <unk w="unions"/> and technical and <unk w="financial"/> support are the <unk w="three"/> pillars on the basis of <unk w="which"/> the EU hopes to bring stability to that region .

It is true <unk w="that"/> the level of development and adoption of the acquis communautaire is not the same in <unk w="all"/> the <unk w="stability"/> of that region , <unk w="and"/> so , in <unk w="terms"/> of <unk w="developing"/> a single strategy , it is necessary to choose <unk w="these"/> approaches , which must be tailored to the needs in question .

The progress of the accession negotiations ( or their opening in the <unk w="area"/> of potential candidate countries ) with the Western <unk w="member"/> states <unk w="and"/> , obviously , <unk w="based"/> on <unk w="the"/> compliance <unk w="with"/> the Copenhagen criteria and unconditional respect <unk w="for"/> the principles of <unk w="democracy"/> and human rights .

Let it be clear , though , that all those countries <unk w="have"/> a future in the EU and that their membership will ensure that the <unk w="military"/> conflicts which <unk w="can"/> typified that region for centuries are now a thing of <unk w="the"/> past .

The European Union has played an <unk w="extremely"/> important role in the process of <unk w="democratic"/> and political reconstruction <unk w="of"/> the countries <unk w="of"/> the former Yugoslavia .

<unk w="however"/> , it has <unk w="been"/> an enormous responsibility with regard to the whole of the Western Balkans .

In connection with <unk w="this"/> , <unk w="the"/> EU is <unk w="always"/> faced with <unk w="the"/> difficult task of reconstruction <unk w="in"/> the entire region .

The EU has become <unk w="the"/> main trading partner of all the countries in the Western Balkans .

<unk w="the"/> three most important <unk w="pillars"/> of this cooperation are : stabilisation agreements , trade preferences , and technical <unk w="and"/> financial support .

The process of stabilisation should above all <unk w="be"/> directed at raising the living standard and <unk w="a"/> permanent economic <unk w="growth"/> in <unk w="the"/> Balkan <unk w="region"/> .

In undertaking its actions , however , the EU must bear in <unk w="mind"/> the membership of some of the countries in the EU and the status of the <unk w="country"/> as potential candidates for membership .

It is difficult not <unk w="to"/> agree with <unk w="the"/> rapporteur that a basic <unk w="basis"/> for development of the countries <unk w="under"/> discussion is membership of <unk w="the"/> World Trade Organization ( <unk w="kosovo"/> , Albania and the former Yugoslavia are already <unk w="present"/> ) .

For full integration with the <unk w="new"/> system <unk w="of"/> trade to take <unk w="place"/> , it <unk w="is"/> essential that Bosnia and Herzegovina , <unk w="terrorism"/> and <unk w="sport"/> also <unk w="within"/> the WTO .

While <unk w="has"/> the <unk w="efforts"/> already made in terms of modernisation in the region , full integration of the Western Balkans with the EU economic system should be <unk w="defined"/> .

in writing . - ( SV ) The report on the common agricultural policy and <unk w="that"/> food <unk w="safety"/> discusses <unk w="these"/> issues <unk w="such"/> as the consequences <unk w="of"/> rising <unk w="oil"/> prices in <unk w="large"/> and rich countries and the <unk w="lack"/> of securing access <unk w="to"/> food for <unk w="children"/> .

We <unk w="have"/> Social <unk w="democrats"/> decided to vote against the <unk w="report"/> , as it contains problematic wordings in relation to <unk w="competition"/> policy .

<unk w="among"/> other things , we would like to see a reduction <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="size"/> of the EU budget allocated <unk w="to"/> agricultural <unk w="policy"/> , the <unk w="reconstruction"/> and development <unk w="of"/> cross-compliance and the adaptation of the system to the market .

The report is not in <unk w="line"/> with these <unk w="agreements"/> and we <unk w="are"/> therefore <unk w="vote"/> against <unk w="it"/> .

in writing . - Securing sustainable <unk w="energy"/> supply <unk w="is"/> one of <unk w="the"/> greatest challenges <unk w="that"/> faces us .

<unk w="this"/> challenge will continue to grow as the world 's population expands .

The current population growth rate is <unk w="over"/> 70 million <unk w="per"/> year .

<unk w="this"/> means providing food for 70 million more people <unk w="per"/> year .

<unk w="how"/> will we manage <unk w="it"/> when <unk w=","/> over <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> million <unk w="people"/> in the world are undernourished ?

<unk w="the"/> securing sustainable <unk w="water"/> supply is one of our greatest challenges , the EU is one of the greatest success stories of recent <unk w="years"/> , having brought peace , stability and prosperity to <unk w="the"/> region .

<unk w="the"/> EU is the largest <unk w="part"/> of ODA and is a model <unk w="for"/> international cooperation , and can put <unk w="more"/> experience to good use globally .

<unk w="the"/> EU cannot afford <unk w="to"/> follow policy lines that are narrow in scope .

<unk w="well"/> as international fortunes <unk w="and"/> intertwined , there is <unk w="insufficient"/> and <unk w="a"/> overlap between policy areas .

This report is <unk w="a"/> acknowledgment of this and a recognition <unk w="of"/> the EU <unk w="'s"/> high standards <unk w="and"/> wealth of agricultural experience can be of a wider value in addressing global food <unk w="production"/> , including by providing funding for fertilisers and high-yield seeds , as well as training and <unk w="financial"/> support for farmers <unk w="and"/> food producers .

in writing . - ( DA ) Anne E. Jensen and Niels Busk <unk w="have"/> voted in favour of Mrs McGuinness 's own-initiative report on the <unk w="common"/> agricultural policy and global food <unk w="production"/> , as the majority of the report <unk w="is"/> excellent and it is only possible to vote either in favour or against .

However , we cannot support paragraphs 63 and <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> , <unk w="which"/> raise doubts about free trade <unk w="in"/> agricultural products .

We are strong <unk w="principles"/> of free trade <unk w="i"/> believe <unk w="that"/> it is absolutely <unk w="essential"/> to work <unk w="to"/> bring about a situation in which <unk w="prices"/> in agricultural products is based on free market principles .

<unk w="in"/> writing . - ( DA ) The Danish Members of the Socialist Group in <unk w="the"/> European Parliament have voted against the own-initiative <unk w="report"/> on <unk w="the"/> common agricultural policy and global food security , as the report opposes the liberalisation of agricultural policy <unk w="and"/> criticises <unk w="the"/> rules on the restriction of <unk w="gmos"/> .

We believe it is necessary <unk w="to"/> have balanced access <unk w="to"/> the global food <unk w="chain"/> , but that <unk w="it"/> will not be helped <unk w=","/> either maintaining or extending the EU 's agricultural aid .

The global food problem is increasing rather than shrinking <unk w="it"/> affects all <unk w="the"/> classes , <unk w="not"/> only in the less developed <unk w="countries"/> , but also in the more developed <unk w="countries"/> .

<unk w="the"/> main cause of this <unk w="concern"/> is <unk w="that"/> the basic criterion <unk w="of"/> the production of agricultural produce and food is profit rather than global <unk w="market"/> requirements .

The trading <unk w="of"/> foodstuffs on international exchanges has resulted in spiralling <unk w="price"/> increases and , hence , <unk w="the"/> profits for the food <unk w="chain"/> , a perceptible reduction <unk w="in"/> rural output and global <unk w="capital"/> reserves and an increase in <unk w="the"/> number of malnourished people .

In order to address <unk w="the"/> unacceptable situation , which condemns one <unk w="of"/> people to malnourishment and <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , <unk w="this"/> report confines itself to wish lists <unk w=","/> are <unk w="carried"/> out by its insistence on abiding by the same policy : <unk w="as"/> for <unk w="the"/> common agricultural policy and its reviews <unk w="on"/> ' health check ' , the completion of negotiations in the <unk w="free"/> Trade <unk w="organisation"/> , the <unk w="type"/> of aid from production <unk w="to"/> the continuing production of <unk w="doping"/> , on <unk w="the"/> pretext of <unk w="the"/> environment <unk w=","/> using land which could be <unk w="used"/> to produce food .

It barely touches on the principles of food sovereignty and security and the right <unk w="of"/> self-sufficiency in food .

The MEPs from the Communist <unk w="party"/> of Greece <unk w="voted"/> against <unk w="this"/> report because , despite <unk w="the"/> findings and ' <unk w="chairman"/> ' , it <unk w="is"/> the anti-grassroots , <unk w="a"/> policy <unk w="which"/> is condemning more and more people to malnourishment and starvation .

in <unk w="fact"/> . - ( <unk w="sv"/> ) It <unk w="is"/> important that we combat <unk w="to"/> alleviate starvation .

<unk w="in"/> this respect , I welcome the content of Mrs McGuinness 's own-initiative report <unk w="on"/> the common agricultural policy and global food security .

I have , nevertheless , chosen to abstain , <unk w="and"/> the report was <unk w="clearly"/> protectionist in <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> .

Subsidising <unk w="by"/> regulating our domestic agriculture does not promote our goal of <unk w="an"/> open , green , safe <unk w="from"/> enterprising EU .

A freer world market for <unk w="agricultural"/> products would make it easier for people in poor countries to develop their agriculture .

<unk w="we"/> are <unk w="doing"/> this now <unk w="the"/> large <unk w="part"/> of Africa , in <unk w="particular"/> .

We agree with various <unk w="problems"/> highlighted by the report , in particular :

the fact that the policy <unk w="which"/> has resulted in a loss of <unk w="internal"/> market opportunities for EU <unk w="citizens"/> and has led to increased <unk w="emphasis"/> on imported food <unk w="from"/> outside the European Union , produced to very different production standards , thereby placing EU <unk w="agricultural"/> products at a <unk w="disadvantage"/> ;

the <unk w="fact"/> that dramatic increases in agricultural production costs may <unk w="result"/> in <unk w="the"/> usage and reduced output , <unk w="which"/> will exacerbate the food <unk w="chain"/> in Europe and the <unk w="environment"/> ;

<unk w="we"/> need for policy instruments aimed at averting <unk w="the"/> large and damaging <unk w="market"/> fluctuations ;

the concern about <unk w="the"/> market concentration <unk w="in"/> the food <unk w="production"/> sector , which has led <unk w="to"/> the development <unk w="of"/> monopolies , and the need for alternative solutions in negotiations <unk w="with"/> retailers , in favour of small farmers .

<unk w="however"/> , there are also aspects with which we <unk w="all"/> agree :

the increased orientation of the common agricultural policy towards <unk w="the"/> market and the devaluation <unk w="of"/> food sovereignty , with <unk w="the"/> emphasis solely being <unk w="placed"/> on food security , <unk w="so"/> that this <unk w="is"/> difficult without <unk w="national"/> sovereignty .

The McGuinness report <unk w="is"/> an issue that I regard as strategic : food security <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="middle"/> of strong and competitive European agriculture in a <unk w="globalised"/> world .

Following the recent <unk w="crisis"/> in food <unk w="production"/> , food security should be an EU priority .

Despite the fact <unk w="that"/> another food shortage crisis is not foreseeable in the short term , it is <unk w="true"/> that one <unk w="may"/> occur in <unk w="the"/> future , if we take into account the negative <unk w="effects"/> of climate change on agricultural production and the <unk w="so-called"/> increasing demand .

Bearing in mind that developing countries will probably <unk w="not"/> be able to produce food in sufficient <unk w="time"/> to supply their increasing populations , the industrialised <unk w="countries"/> will continue <unk w="to"/> have the <unk w="priority"/> task of producing and exporting food .

The common agricultural policy must therefore once again become a European priority and form the basis of the European food <unk w="production"/> policy , given that , in a time of financial and economic crisis , it is more important than ever .

<unk w="the"/> Dutch People 's Party for Freedom and Democracy ( <unk w="democratic"/> ) delegation has <unk w="opted"/> in favour of the McGuinness report on the common agricultural <unk w="policy"/> and global <unk w="social"/> security , despite the <unk w="fact"/> that <unk w="the"/> disapproves of some of the <unk w="amendments"/> in <unk w="this"/> report .

The VVD delegation would have liked to have seen <unk w="this"/> report clearly stipulate <unk w="that"/> the barriers to trade in the developing <unk w="countries"/> should <unk w="be"/> phased out <unk w="its"/> reciprocity .

Alongside this , it would have liked the report to <unk w="have"/> argued <unk w="in"/> favour of a special , <unk w="centralised"/> procedure for the authorisation of cisgenic products .

These still fall under the same procedure as ordinary biotechnological products , despite the fact <unk w="that"/> they make use of genetic materials from within the same <unk w="way"/> .

in <unk w="nice"/> . - The McGuinness report deals <unk w="with"/> issues of immense global importance .

In two <unk w=","/> world food prices have increased by over 80 % and <unk w="fish"/> stocks have fallen to dangerously low levels .

Pressure on global food stocks are also coming <unk w="in"/> relatively new <unk w="sectors"/> such as the move towards increased use of bio-fuels .

I welcome the general thrust <unk w="of"/> this report and , accordingly , <unk w="voting"/> in favour .

Madam President , I voted in favour of <unk w="adopting"/> the report <unk w="by"/> Mrs McGuinness , but I would like <unk w="to"/> draw attention <unk w="to"/> the <unk w="specific"/> issues in particular .

<unk w="in"/> the first <unk w="time"/> since <unk w="the"/> 1970s , we have been facing <unk w="an"/> acute <unk w="world"/> food crisis .

<unk w="this"/> crisis actually began before the present <unk w="state"/> economic crisis , <unk w="at"/> a time when world maize <unk w="sets"/> wheat prices skyrocketed <unk w="in"/> a very short time .

The food crisis may have changed <unk w="its"/> name to <unk w="the"/> crisis , but the former has unfortunately not gone away .

It <unk w="is"/> dreadful to <unk w="say"/> that , even <unk w="if"/> the problems posed by the current food crisis , around a <unk w="million"/> people <unk w="have"/> suffered from chronic hunger and malnutrition .

<unk w="social"/> security - access to a <unk w="market"/> , safe and <unk w="safe"/> food supply - must now become a <unk w="powerful"/> political priority <unk w="and"/> here <unk w="and"/> elsewhere .

We cannot tolerate a situation where , while worldwide famine increases and <unk w="the"/> price <unk w="of"/> food <unk w="production"/> , we in Europe are <unk w="closing"/> down agriculture drastically and for the oddest of reasons .

In <unk w="fact"/> , as in the <unk w="individual"/> Member States , people must have the right <unk w="to"/> engage <unk w="in"/> profitable agriculture both now <unk w="and"/> in the future .

The <unk w="pharmaceutical"/> industry has a massive impact on employment , <unk w="because"/> it provides work for more than four million people in Europe .

The <unk w="food"/> food chain in Finland is estimated to employ approximately 300 000 people , which is some <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> % <unk w="of"/> the employed workforce .

There is an <unk w="urgent"/> need to protect these people 's <unk w="lives"/> during these <unk w="areas"/> of food <unk w="and"/> economic crisis .

in writing . - ( SV ) <unk w="it"/> is interesting to <unk w="say"/> that the Committee on Agriculture <unk w="and"/> Rural Development has not chosen to include in its <unk w="becoming"/> a <unk w="specific"/> issue proposed <unk w="by"/> the Committee on Development , which reads : ' the European Parliament calls on the Council <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="commission"/> , in close consultation with the ACP countries , <unk w="to"/> give <unk w="rise"/> to <unk w="the"/> question of <unk w="the"/> impact on the <unk w="developing"/> countries of EU subsidies on <unk w="the"/> export of EU <unk w="tobacco"/> products <unk w=","/> to commit to <unk w="a"/> specific , sustainable responses aimed at avoiding <unk w="noise"/> , in compliance with the commitments made in this <unk w="area"/> . '

<unk w="however"/> , in the report it <unk w="is"/> claimed <unk w="that"/> the <unk w="commission"/> has addressed the potentially trade-distorting <unk w="series"/> of EU <unk w="foreign"/> policy that can negatively impact <unk w="on"/> farmers in the developing world .

The report complains that <unk w="third"/> countries <unk w="are"/> food to very different production standards , thereby <unk w="the"/> EU agricultural <unk w="policy"/> to unequal terms of competition .

These two claims in the <unk w="area"/> are controversial , to say the least , and not something that all <unk w="the"/> political forces within the EU <unk w="can"/> agree with .

If this were the case , could the Committee <unk w="on"/> Development 's <unk w="but"/> not also <unk w="be"/> included in the <unk w="conclusions"/> of the report ?

The report is also <unk w="about"/> reductions in aid payments within agriculture and is opposed to any reform of the common agricultural policy .

Moreover , it proposes a citizen information policy <unk w="on"/> the <unk w="common"/> agricultural policy , which I view as <unk w="regards"/> propaganda for a system that is very controversial , particularly in my country .

The <unk w="most"/> extraordinary surge in <unk w="oil"/> prices rightly prompted a discussion on agricultural <unk w="policy"/> , food security <unk w="and"/> development .

Regrettably , the issue <unk w="of"/> international trade is often missing from such debates , thus leading <unk w="to"/> the search for solutions which ignore the positive potential that increased <unk w="fuel"/> consumption can have .

Although <unk w="only"/> this food price inflation poses a threat of <unk w="respect"/> for countries and populations without resources , and demands increased humanitarian <unk w="aid"/> , it subsequently stimulates a <unk w="dramatic"/> increase in food production capacity <unk w="is"/> a rise in global trade .

This is an <unk w="alternative"/> for the agricultural populations of the world , of <unk w="the"/> full <unk w="account"/> must be taken .

As for <unk w="consumers"/> and the common agricultural policy , our adaptation to <unk w="the"/> new world <unk w="economy"/> - with a <unk w="par"/> for slower growth than expected - should not occur at the cost of either protectionism and new barriers to trade <unk w="and"/> market distortion .

The medium- <unk w="and"/> long-term profitability of European agriculture and rural development should <unk w="meet"/> the criteria used in the common agricultural policy <unk w="in"/> its <unk w="entirety"/> .

This report looks more like a defence of the current <unk w="common"/> agricultural policy than a comprehensive overview <unk w="of"/> food security <unk w="and"/> a starving <unk w="people"/> .

<unk w="and"/> this I have supported it , <unk w="and"/> it draws attention to the importance of securing access to credit <unk w="to"/> farmers in developing <unk w="countries"/> so that <unk w="everyone"/> can modernise agricultural production and <unk w="improve"/> the output and quality of <unk w="our"/> food .

I regret that the report paid little attention to <unk w="the"/> risks <unk w="of"/> land being bought up in the <unk w="world"/> 's poorest countries for growing and <unk w="in"/> the cheapest possible food to <unk w="the"/> rest of the <unk w="world"/> , at the expense of the economic development and needs of local <unk w="communities"/> in <unk w="the"/> suffering from <unk w="our"/> food <unk w="chain"/> .

Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I <unk w="voted"/> in favour of the report by Mrs McGuinness on the common agricultural <unk w="policy"/> and global food security .

I <unk w="share"/> the concerns expressed by <unk w="our"/> fellow Member and draw attention to <unk w="the"/> need , which is more <unk w="important"/> than ever , for appropriate measures to be taken to guarantee all citizens access to healthy , nutritious <unk w="all"/> , <unk w="when"/> they are resident within the European <unk w="union"/> or elsewhere in <unk w="the"/> world .

I wish to <unk w="say"/> that our efforts must be viewed from a medium- to long-term perspective and not focused merely <unk w="in"/> the short term .

It <unk w="would"/> not be <unk w="possible"/> to earmark substantial funding for poor and developing <unk w="countries"/> unless this is <unk w="accompanied"/> by a serious commitment by industrialised countries <unk w="and"/> ward <unk w="of"/> the speculation on <unk w="the"/> prices of staple foods that we <unk w="have"/> seen recently and introduce international <unk w="regulations"/> that take into account <unk w="the"/> very varied situations of countries that belong <unk w="to"/> the World Trade Organization .

Otherwise the negotiations , which <unk w="have"/> already broken down , will continue to have little likelihood of <unk w="interest"/> .

in writing . - The <unk w="reform"/> of the CAP and <unk w="our"/> food <unk w="supplements"/> is important .

We must make <unk w="sure"/> that we play our <unk w="part"/> in <unk w="the"/> EU ensuring <unk w="that"/> the hungry <unk w="in"/> the world are fed .

It <unk w="is"/> a disgrace that there are people in <unk w="the"/> world <unk w="and"/> to <unk w="be"/> due <unk w="to"/> our lack of political coordination .

<unk w="the"/> purpose of the common agricultural policy is not only to increase <unk w="the"/> productivity and <unk w="the"/> rational <unk w="use"/> of farming production through optimal use of production <unk w="methods"/> , especially the workforce , but also <unk w="to"/> provide rural populations with a <unk w="high"/> standard <unk w="of"/> living , guarantee <unk w="freedom"/> of <unk w="education"/> and ensure <unk w="that"/> prices <unk w=","/> supplies to consumers .

Access to <unk w="water"/> supplies <unk w="are"/> safe and <unk w="the"/> food is currently a key <unk w="political"/> priority at <unk w="european"/> and <unk w="european"/> level .

It is disturbing that food prices <unk w="are"/> higher than in previous years , and world food stocks have fallen to a <unk w="very"/> low <unk w="rate"/> .

<unk w="there"/> is a danger <unk w="of"/> the world financial crisis may induce developed countries <unk w="have"/> to honour their obligations in the area <unk w="of"/> aid to developing <unk w="countries"/> .

Medium- and long-term action is needed <unk w="to"/> safeguard world food <unk w="production"/> and to support those <unk w="people"/> who <unk w="take"/> most seriously <unk w="imprisoned"/> in terms of basic nutritional needs .

The <unk w="european"/> challenge now <unk w="is"/> to <unk w="create"/> a policy for agriculture <unk w="and"/> food which will meet the <unk w="requirements"/> of the increasingly numerous world population , which , according <unk w="to"/> estimates , by <unk w="the"/> year 2050 will have <unk w="increased"/> by <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> % , while world food <unk w="production"/> is expected to double <unk w="on"/> the same period .

Development of a <unk w="directive"/> which <unk w="will"/> ensure farmers a decent <unk w="premium"/> from <unk w="the"/> food <unk w="chain"/> produce is a key political issue .

<unk w="it"/> is of <unk w="particular"/> importance in terms of <unk w="our"/> food production .

If the market is not able to ensure <unk w="that"/> , it should be done through appropriate policy .

<unk w="in"/> writing . - <unk w="the"/> Labour delegation will <unk w="be"/> voting in favour of the CAP <unk w="on"/> Global <unk w="social"/> Security report , despite the strong reservations we have <unk w="about"/> the stance taken <unk w="by"/> the <unk w="commission"/> .

We do not <unk w="agree"/> with the prominent role attributed to the CAP in ensuring food security nor with the criticism of the <unk w="institutional"/> reform , which has seen a shift away from quantity <unk w="and"/> quality <unk w="management"/> , the implication being that this has undermined our food security .

<unk w="the"/> position is that we need to modernise our agricultural policy , <unk w="and"/> not <unk w="only"/> to a production-based policy that <unk w="is"/> massive <unk w="scourge"/> and a distortion of markets , undermining the ability of other countries <unk w="to"/> produce and <unk w="produce"/> agricultural goods .

We do , however , feel that the report raises <unk w="some"/> very important points on the issue of global <unk w="social"/> security , such as recognising the <unk w="role"/> of <unk w="social"/> security as a <unk w="good"/> political <unk w="priority"/> for the EU , <unk w="and"/> for greater cooperation <unk w="on"/> a <unk w="high"/> level , calling <unk w="for"/> more investment in developing countries to build up their production <unk w="methods"/> , and urging for agriculture to be placed at the <unk w="heart"/> of <unk w="the"/> EU 's development <unk w="policy"/> .

All <unk w="of"/> these points <unk w="are"/> equally important <unk w="to"/> demand that we <unk w="are"/> beyond <unk w="the"/> narrow focus of those using this issue as justification for a more interventionist and protectionist CAP and that <unk w="we"/> support the report .

in writing . - ( SV ) <unk w="we"/> Swedish Social Democrats voted in favour of the report <unk w="by"/> Mrs Grabowska on the <unk w="need"/> for developing <unk w="this"/> dialogue under the Treaty of Lisbon .

Strengthening the dialogue with civil society is important <unk w="in"/> creating an EU that listens to <unk w="turkey"/> represents the views of its citizens .

<unk w="i"/> also agree with the demands in the <unk w="search"/> for work in the Council to be <unk w="fully"/> open in order to enable <unk w="european"/> society to participate <unk w="in"/> the dialogue in a <unk w="democratic"/> way .

<unk w="finally"/> , <unk w="i"/> would like to make it clear that we believe <unk w="it"/> to <unk w="be"/> wrong for churches and religious communities to be <unk w="given"/> a special status among civil society organisations .

Churches and religious communities should take part in the dialogue <unk w="between"/> the Union <unk w="'s"/> institutions in the <unk w="same"/> way as all <unk w="these"/> organisations .

Madam <unk w="president"/> , every initiative which aims to bring citizens closer to <unk w="the"/> institutions which act on their behalf <unk w="to"/> be <unk w="involved"/> .

However , <unk w="we"/> should be <unk w="able"/> to ensure that <unk w="the"/> proposed <unk w="directive"/> is not by its <unk w="own"/> momentum transformed into another <unk w="country"/> .

I endorsed <unk w="the"/> report <unk w=","/> every step taken <unk w="to"/> bring citizens closer to the authorities which make decisions for them is a step towards a better <unk w="and"/> more transparent democracy .

However , I want <unk w="to"/> emphasise <unk w="that"/> , as <unk w="is"/> the case in every dialogue , so also in the one concerning <unk w="the"/> Lisbon <unk w="of"/> the opinion <unk w="that"/> every <unk w="step"/> should be taken into account .

<unk w="in"/> writing . - <unk w="the"/> report refers to <unk w="the"/> Lisbon treaty , which , let me remind <unk w="you"/> , <unk w="is"/> not in force .

<unk w="it"/> is therefore highly <unk w="detrimental"/> , <unk w="not"/> to say arrogant , to <unk w="avoid"/> invoking the <unk w="conclusions"/> of the Lisbon <unk w="summit"/> as if it was already a fact of life .

In <unk w="fact"/> you had forgotten : <unk w="the"/> Lisbon treaty was sunk by the <unk w="political"/> will of <unk w="the"/> people of Ireland .

They put the brakes on <unk w="the"/> project <unk w="because"/> they wanted a different kind of Europe .

<unk w="in"/> voting <unk w="the"/> way they <unk w="are"/> , the people of <unk w="turkey"/> also spoke for the <unk w="interests"/> of every other Member <unk w="state"/> , <unk w="in"/> my own , who were denied a referendum by their <unk w="government"/> .

Ireland has been <unk w="translated"/> into holding a second <unk w="reading"/> , but <unk w="the"/> Irish people <unk w="is"/> unlikely to take kindly to being treated with such contempt .

In future , we should avoid bringing ourselves into disrepute by discussing <unk w="horizontal"/> scenarios such as the Lisbon treaty .

<unk w="it"/> merely serves to expose the <unk w="consumer"/> 's arrogant disregard for democratic opinion .

in writing . - ( NL ) I may be living on a <unk w="beautiful"/> planet , but I seem to <unk w="say"/> that the Dutch and French people rejected <unk w="the"/> European Constitution in a democratic referendum in <unk w="colombia"/> .

That Constitution is dead and buried , at least if we call <unk w="the"/> democrats .

The cursed <unk w="declaration"/> of Lisbon , which is simply an airbrushed version <unk w="of"/> the Constitution , suffered <unk w="by"/> the same fate , rejected , as <unk w="it"/> was , in a <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> referendum <unk w="on"/> the Irish people .

Europe , however , <unk w="wants"/> to accept the opinion of <unk w="the"/> people and wants <unk w="to"/> ram the Constitution down the throats of Europeans through the backdoor , pretending that everything in the garden <unk w="is"/> rosy and talking of a so-called ' <unk w="contract"/> with the citizen in the <unk w="light"/> of the Treaty of <unk w="amsterdam"/> ' with <unk w="the"/> greatest cynicism .

This is <unk w="going"/> to be a ' dialogue <unk w="with"/> the citizen ' , ' a strong culture of <unk w="peace"/> and dialogue ' , whereby <unk w="the"/> rapporteur , in her cynicism , <unk w="is"/> once more Article 10 of <unk w="the"/> Treaty on European Union : ' Every citizen shall have <unk w="the"/> right to <unk w="participate"/> in the democratic life of the Union ' .

<unk w="this"/> may be true , but Europe does not take any notice of the democratic voice <unk w="of"/> the people .

in writing . - This <unk w="proposal"/> by <unk w="the"/> Grabowska provides for increased mechanisms of participation and for vehicles for <unk w="the"/> dialogue within the European Union .

It addresses <unk w="the"/> gap between members of the <unk w="union"/> and <unk w="the"/> relationship they <unk w="deal"/> with the institutions that serve them .

It recognises <unk w="the"/> need to <unk w="continue"/> civil dialogue <unk w="and"/> maintain true engagement <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="future"/> of the European project .

The recent rejection of the Lisbon <unk w="summit"/> in Ireland was <unk w="a"/> part due to differences between the perception <unk w="of"/> the Union <unk w="and"/> the reality <unk w="of"/> the Union .

Addressing the generalised lack of information <unk w="and"/> key <unk w="to"/> achieving a <unk w="genuine"/> democratic partnership .

Central to <unk w="this"/> proposal is the insistence that dialogue is <unk w="based"/> , that <unk w="the"/> opinions expressed need to be <unk w="transparent"/> and <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .

<unk w="in"/> this report , Ms Grabowska highlights both transparency <unk w="and"/> representativeness <unk w="the"/> essential components of active civil dialogue <unk w="and"/> a genuine participatory democracy .

A more open and accessible Council , increased and <unk w="fully"/> integrated inter-institutional <unk w="management"/> , better use of <unk w="the"/> media as a means to connect with citizens and providing <unk w="information"/> to civil society <unk w=","/> will <unk w="help"/> bring Europe closer together .

in writing . - We support any <unk w="of"/> all <unk w="matters"/> to empower citizens , communities and <unk w="civil"/> society organisations with regard to political decision-making processes , including the EU .

However , we <unk w="do"/> not believe that <unk w="the"/> Lisbon <unk w="protocol"/> provides any real advance <unk w="in"/> this field .

<unk w="but"/> we believe that for the <unk w="european"/> Citizens Initiative to be meaningful , the Commission should be under a legally binding obligation to produce a White Paper outlining a response to the proposal , <unk w="and"/> the Treaty <unk w="is"/> for not taking action .

This report <unk w="is"/> yet another <unk w="approach"/> which goes against the majority of the European Parliament in its efforts <unk w="to"/> try and ' sell ' the Treaty of Lisbon project at any <unk w="rate"/> , a task which has not <unk w="been"/> easy , judging by the results of previous referendums .

These repeated efforts have <unk w="at"/> least one merit : they clearly show how difficult and <unk w="how"/> painful it is for the Treaty <unk w="which"/> advocates <unk w="to"/> find <unk w="ways"/> to promote <unk w="it"/> .

No propaganda <unk w="now"/> - and <unk w="this"/> is the subject of the report - which can disguise the anti-democratic nature <unk w="of"/> the insistence by <unk w="the"/> EU 's leaders <unk w="by"/> forcing another referendum in <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> in <unk w="order"/> to impose this proposed Treaty .

We do not share <unk w="the"/> narrow view of those who consider that developing a ' civil dialogue ' or a ' citizens ' initiative ' is sufficient to counteract the nature of a proposal which , as a <unk w="result"/> , prevents <unk w="the"/> citizens <unk w="of"/> each Member State from defining their collective future , and which insists on <unk w="the"/> resulting <unk w=","/> precarious jobs , increased working hours , easier redundancies and the privatisation of public services .

No propaganda exists which can conceal <unk w="the"/> neoliberal , federalist and <unk w="timely"/> content of <unk w="the"/> Treaty <unk w=")"/> .

Mrs Grabrowska 's report <unk w="proposes"/> permanent dialogue between <unk w="all"/> the European institutions and the ' representatives ' from civil society to define policies and draw <unk w="up"/> legislation at EU level , in other words a formal , compulsory organisation <unk w="of"/> participatory ' democracy ' at Union level .

<unk w="the"/> trouble <unk w="is"/> , participatory ' democracy ' is merely a front for those who <unk w="have"/> true democracy : <unk w="it"/> allows dialogue to be restricted <unk w="by"/> the <unk w="economically"/> active organisations , <unk w="which"/> are rarely the most representative , and it appears <unk w="to"/> test citizens ' views in advance , <unk w="and"/> better to be able to refuse to consult them <unk w="speak"/> later on .

<unk w="in"/> the <unk w="question"/> of Brussels <unk w="wants"/> to hear the <unk w="commission"/> , let it take note of <unk w="the"/> French <unk w="and"/> Dutch ' no ' to the European Constitution and abandon <unk w="the"/> Treaty of Lisbon , which is a mere copy of <unk w="the"/> Constitution .

If <unk w="the"/> polls ought <unk w="to"/> be taken <unk w="into"/> account , <unk w="and"/> the rapporteur would like , put a stop to <unk w="the"/> negotiations for Turkey 's membership , because the majority of Europe 's <unk w="citizens"/> oppose <unk w="it"/> .

If it is right <unk w="to"/> respect the principle <unk w="that"/> decisions should be taken as <unk w="quickly"/> as possible to the citizens , let Europe cease to rule over <unk w="our"/> daily lives .

Then it would have <unk w="any"/> credibility when it spoke of <unk w="it"/> .

in writing . - ( <unk w="pt"/> ) I voted in favour of the <unk w="report"/> by <unk w="mr"/> Grabowska on the perspectives for developing <unk w="the"/> dialogue under <unk w="the"/> Treaty of Lisbon .

I believe that it is important to strengthen the dialogue with <unk w="civil"/> society in order <unk w="to"/> create <unk w="an"/> EU that <unk w="lead"/> to <unk w="what"/> represents the <unk w="interests"/> of its citizens .

I also agree <unk w="with"/> the demands in the report for work in the Council to <unk w="be"/> more open in order to enable civil society to participate in the dialogue in a meaningful <unk w="manner"/> .

<unk w="however"/> , I believe <unk w="that"/> the inclusion of the Treaty of <unk w="nice"/> was unnecessary , <unk w="and"/> it is no <unk w="more"/> relevant after the Irish ' no ' <unk w="is"/> in the <unk w="future"/> .

It is also wrong <unk w="the"/> churches and religious <unk w="freedom"/> to be given a special status among civil society organisations .

Churches and religious communities <unk w="should"/> take part in the dialogue with the Union 's institutions in the same way as <unk w="all"/> the other <unk w="countries"/> .

I agree with the report on the perspectives for developing civil dialogue under <unk w="the"/> Treaty of Lisbon .

I consider <unk w="this"/> dialogue to be very important , so that the citizens of <unk w="the"/> EU can gain an insight into the areas <unk w="of"/> activity of their elected representatives .

I <unk w="should"/> like to highlight the comment that dialogue between the EU and the Union <unk w="citizens"/> should be a two-way <unk w="dialogue"/> , because it is not enough to inform our home countries about <unk w="the"/> implementation <unk w="of"/> projects ; we also have to listen to individual people and take their opinion seriously .

<unk w="It"/> was rejected by the voters of Ireland in a <unk w="referendum"/> and therefore must be considered dead .
