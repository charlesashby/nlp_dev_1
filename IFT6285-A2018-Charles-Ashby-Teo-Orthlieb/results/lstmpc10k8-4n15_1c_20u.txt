It <unk w="is"/> important for <unk w="us"/> to take advantage of the 10th anniversary <unk w="of"/> this key event in European integration <unk w="to"/> pay <unk w="tribute"/> , in my turn , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> who <unk w="had"/> the euro , such <unk w="as"/> Pierre <unk w="and"/> , Helmut Kohl , François <unk w="president"/> , Jacques Delors , Valéry Giscard d 'Estaing <unk w="and"/> others .

I would like , once again , to applaud their vision , their determination <unk w="for"/> their unfailing commitment to Europe .

Those I <unk w="have"/> <unk w="it"/> , and many others who accompanied <unk w="them"/> , could not have imagined the rapid success of their political project .

Since 1 January of this year , 16 Member States have been participating in the Economic and Monetary Union and the <unk w="euro"/> is the currency <unk w="of"/> almost 330 <unk w="million"/> European <unk w="union"/> .

<unk w="the"/> euro , then , has become the <unk w="most"/> <unk w="to"/> sign <unk w="of"/> European integration .

As a tangible sign recognised <unk w="in"/> the world , the euro <unk w="as"/> a measure of stability .

It is protecting <unk w="the"/> citizens from the most serious consequences <unk w="of"/> the economic crisis .

<unk w="for"/> 10 years , it <unk w="has"/> to be recognised <unk w="that"/> the euro is an unquestionable <unk w="one"/> .

Now , anniversaries only have value if they <unk w="buy"/> bridges to the future , as we <unk w="have"/> to recognise <unk w="this"/> , despite our <unk w="positive"/> indulgence as we congratulate ourselves , the true tests for the cohesiveness <unk w="and"/> coherence of the euro area await us .

This year , 2009 , will be an extremely difficult <unk w="task"/> for the euro area economies and for European citizens and there will be many challenges facing us , both internally and externally .

<unk w="unfortunately"/> , euro area governments will <unk w="continue"/> <unk w="to"/> act together to contain <unk w="any"/> effects of <unk w="the"/> economic crisis and invest in the structural bases of the economy to <unk w="build"/> a bridge <unk w="between"/> <unk w="the"/> post-crisis world .

We must not lose sight of the fact that <unk w="the"/> euro , this <unk w="is"/> <unk w="why"/> we have <unk w="to"/> around our economies , did not just fall into our <unk w="borders"/> .

<unk w="the"/> euro area <unk w="too"/> are <unk w="being"/> protected against negative economic developments because being part of <unk w="the"/> euro area <unk w="is"/> a <unk w="matter"/> of quality certifying that its members have a <unk w="personal"/> capacity for implementing prudent macroeconomic <unk w="measures"/> and policies based on sustained growth <unk w="and"/> prosperity <unk w="and"/> its citizens .

<unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="caused"/> by the euro <unk w="is"/> therefore <unk w="be"/> linked <unk w="to"/> our credibility , which rests on <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> to <unk w="other"/> such policies .

This credibility is the foundation of <unk w="the"/> benefits of <unk w="economic"/> and Monetary Union and we must maintain it <unk w="and"/> continue <unk w="access"/> to profit from the benefits of <unk w="the"/> single currency .

Externally , we have <unk w="to"/> learn the political lessons <unk w="of"/> the international financial and economic <unk w="situation"/> .

There is a direct <unk w="direct"/> link between the <unk w="current"/> crisis , with <unk w="the"/> origins in the United States , and the persistence of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="regional"/> imbalances .

The lack of sufficient transparency , responsibility and integrity <unk w="of"/> the financial <unk w="markets"/> therefore acted as a catalyst for <unk w="this"/> crisis .

The re-establishment <unk w="of"/> stability in the <unk w="region"/> and the real economy on a world scale implies a profound reform <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="judicial"/> system and the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of the major imbalances in the mix of <unk w="energy"/> consumption and global saving .

This balancing <unk w="concerns"/> the active cooperation <unk w="of"/> the major <unk w="classes"/> in America , Asia and Europe .

Despite noticeable progress , the euro <unk w="and"/> <unk w="'s"/> image remains , too often , overly fragmented and national interests too <unk w=","/> <unk w="carried"/> out <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> common interest , preventing the euro area from fully assuming <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> responsibility <unk w="it"/> corresponds to its economic <unk w="policy"/> and from achieving all of the economic benefits deriving from Economic and Monetary Union .

<unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and <unk w="the"/> Union is , <unk w="of"/> course , an economic project , but it is , first of all , a political project .

As a result , we must take advantage <unk w="of"/> the euro <unk w="for"/> second decade <unk w="is"/> perfect the Economic and Monetary Union by strengthening its political bodies , <unk w="both"/> internally and externally .

Mr President , Prime Minister , <unk w="president-in-office"/> of the <unk w="commission"/> , ladies and gentlemen , I am sure <unk w="that"/> I am echoing the <unk w="opinion"/> of the vast majority of <unk w="the"/> Chamber in saying that , <unk w="eight"/> years after its <unk w="debate"/> , I , as a European , am proud of the success of the <unk w="report"/> .

I <unk w="would"/> like to congratulate Parliament on its initiative to commemorate <unk w="the"/> 10th <unk w="accession"/> of our single currency here , in this Plenary Chamber of <unk w="the"/> European Parliament <unk w="in"/> Strasbourg .

Over these <unk w="ten"/> years , the euro has <unk w="caused"/> many benefits to all its members <unk w="and"/> continues <unk w="to"/> do so <unk w=","/> amid a deep economic and financial crisis .

Within <unk w="the"/> short period <unk w=","/> a <unk w="year"/> , <unk w="the"/> euro has earned a well-deserved reputation for strength and stability .

The <unk w="first"/> <unk w="is"/> the second of the world 's currencies and , thanks to <unk w="the"/> role in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="irish"/> economy , is already comparable in some respects to the dollar as an instrument of commerce and means of payment in international <unk w="organisations"/> .

Above <unk w="all"/> , though , the euro is part of the <unk w="private"/> life <unk w="of"/> <unk w="of"/> 330 <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> people in 16 <unk w="out"/> of <unk w="the"/> European Union .

<unk w="we"/> all carry in our wallets <unk w="a"/> symbol <unk w="of"/> a shared European identity : because <unk w="the"/> euro , as <unk w="well"/> as being a currency , <unk w="is"/> a central element of our European project , <unk w="with"/> us in a <unk w="new"/> <unk w="series"/> of <unk w="the"/> benefits of the integration <unk w="of"/> that <unk w="is"/> over half a <unk w="year"/> ago .

The euro <unk w="has"/> given us low inflation and low interest rates , thanks to a macroeconomic framework directed at stability .

The euro <unk w="has"/> provided a clear boost to trade and investment among its <unk w="member"/> <unk w="partners"/> .

The euro <unk w="is"/> also <unk w="concerns"/> the creation of 16 million jobs over the last 10 years <unk w="in"/> the euro area , three <unk w="of"/> the corresponding <unk w="programmes"/> <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="last"/> decade .

The euro has encouraged <unk w="european"/> integration and the <unk w="removal"/> of the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="union"/> ; it has protected the members <unk w="of"/> the euro area from external disruption ; <unk w="the"/> <unk w="it"/> has <unk w="increased"/> and continues to be a pole <unk w="of"/> stability , not <unk w="just"/> for the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="process"/> , <unk w="but"/> also for the global economy .

The <unk w="commission"/> is , without a <unk w="doubt"/> , a touchstone for the euro .

However , those who think <unk w="that"/> the <unk w="economic"/> and Monetary Union <unk w="are"/> not <unk w="have"/> to face the consequences of this crisis are <unk w="very"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .

On the contrary , if the single currency did <unk w="not"/> exist , the adverse effects of the crisis would be much greater .

Many <unk w="member"/> States would <unk w="surely"/> be facing great volatility in their exchange rates and , possibly , might even be suffering speculative attacks <unk w="on"/> their currencies .

The <unk w="reduction"/> of their public debt <unk w=")"/> would <unk w="be"/> much greater than currently , and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="measures"/> for combating the crisis through fiscal stimuli would be narrower .

The Stability and Growth Pact , reformed in 2005 , has encouraged governments <unk w="to"/> sort out their <unk w="own"/> accounts , leading in 2007 to the lowest budget deficit for 25 <unk w="%"/> , which is now <unk w="forcing"/> them to face <unk w="the"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="for"/> a better <unk w="future"/> .

Throughout <unk w="the"/> crisis , the actions of the <unk w="european"/> Central Bank have done <unk w="to"/> <unk w="to"/> reinforce the <unk w="entire"/> reputation that it had already <unk w="been"/> <unk w="in"/> the early <unk w="process"/> of Economic <unk w="and"/> Monetary Union .

By <unk w="giving"/> <unk w=","/> the necessary <unk w="measures"/> and taking the <unk w="lead"/> in cooperating with the other central <unk w="poorest"/> <unk w="of"/> industrialised countries , the European <unk w="central"/> Bank <unk w="has"/> served as our guide throughout this period and has <unk w="thus"/> contributed <unk w="to"/> preventing huge financial collapse .

The economic situation is not as we would have <unk w="been"/> <unk w="if"/> we <unk w="deplore"/> this anniversary , but events are highlighting <unk w="more"/> than ever the advantages of Economic and Monetary Union .

<unk w="in"/> those countries which have not <unk w="yet"/> joined , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="free-trade"/> area is an increasingly attractive option , as demonstrated last week in Bratislava when <unk w="we"/> welcomed Slovakia as the newest - the 16th - member of the euro family .

The European Commission and Parliament <unk w="should"/> continue working with Member States , the Eurogroup , the European <unk w="union"/> <unk w=","/> and the international community in order to place our economies on the <unk w="path"/> to <unk w="achieve"/> sustainable resumption <unk w="of"/> growth .

In this regard , the Commission 's recommendations in <unk w="the"/> report that we submitted a few <unk w="brief"/> <unk w=","/> on the <unk w="last"/> 10 years of <unk w="economic"/> <unk w="and"/> Monetary Union , which was recently debated <unk w="in"/> <unk w="this"/> Chamber , are as <unk w="a"/> or even more valid today than they were <unk w="in"/> spring .

Increased budgetary <unk w="lines"/> , <unk w="an"/> extension to other <unk w="social"/> aspects , the link between macroeconomic <unk w="policies"/> and structural <unk w="funds"/> , the <unk w="public"/> image of the euro and improved governance of the Economic and Monetary Union <unk w="too"/> , and must continue <unk w="to"/> be , the core themes on which <unk w="to"/> base the euro 's second decade , <unk w="or"/> at least as <unk w="a"/> <unk w=","/> as this <unk w="is"/> one .

Mr President , I would like to conclude by paying tribute to the <unk w="rapporteur"/> and <unk w="one"/> of the founding fathers of the euro , whose imagination and resolute action bequeathed <unk w="giving"/> us a <unk w="good"/> <unk w="in"/> which all Europeans can be proud .

The crisis has opened up a <unk w="new"/> chapter for <unk w="the"/> <unk w="irish"/> economy , in which the Economic and <unk w="monetary"/> Union must continue to play a relevant role in serving the common interests and <unk w="safety"/> of all Europeans .

Mr President , Mr Juncker , <unk w="mr"/> Trichet , ladies and <unk w="gentlemen"/> , <unk w="everyone"/> who has been involved <unk w="in"/> creating the European <unk w="union"/> is grateful to <unk w="you"/> , <unk w="madam"/> President , and to <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , ladies and <unk w="gentlemen"/> , <unk w="that"/> this <unk w="is"/> fine initiative which you have <unk w="participated"/> in commemorating the 10th anniversary of the birth of <unk w="the"/> euro .

I am one <unk w="of"/> those people who think that it is better to avoid the ever-increasing number <unk w="of"/> commemoration ceremonies , <unk w="and"/> this one is justified because it marks the greatest contribution to European <unk w="policy"/> since the <unk w="president"/> of the <unk w="european"/> Parliament by universal suffrage in 1979 .

We have <unk w="to"/> come a long way and <unk w="doing"/> this pleasant , friendly gathering <unk w="and"/> <unk w="will"/> paint the whole <unk w="process"/> .

I would like to pay <unk w="tribute"/> <unk w="to"/> all <unk w="those"/> who mapped out <unk w="of"/> course and those who have <unk w="done"/> it .

We can find <unk w="the"/> distant origins <unk w="of"/> the report <unk w="by"/> the Luxembourg prime minister , Pierre Werner , <unk w="his"/> predecessor , in <unk w="particular"/> .

It was , however , the monetary crisis in <unk w="recent"/> years that followed and the currency <unk w=","/> which <unk w="the"/> action <unk w="in"/> this area .

As long <unk w="as"/> the currency exchange rates were fixed , the monetary system <unk w="is"/> not upset <unk w="the"/> <unk w="need"/> to create a common market .

After the unsuccessful <unk w="decision"/> to <unk w="be"/> a <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> snake , the strong momentum from France <unk w="and"/> Germany between 1975 and 1980 led to the <unk w="former"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="agreements"/> , <unk w="the"/> northern <unk w="ireland"/> , and the decision to create the European Monetary System and introduce the ecu , <unk w="the"/> euro 's precursor .

This move had the backing and support of our partners in <unk w="the"/> Benelux countries and <unk w="regions"/> .

After a period of <unk w="time"/> activity between 1980 <unk w="and"/> 1988 , the process was given new impetus with <unk w="the"/> creation by the Council of <unk w="the"/> committee chaired by Jacques Delors , <unk w="and"/> in the signature of <unk w="the"/> Maastricht <unk w="treaty"/> .

Let <unk w="me"/> salute <unk w="the"/> pioneers who have been involved in this along the way , as <unk w="you"/> yourself have recently , Mr President , as well as <unk w="my"/> friend , Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and his Secretary of State , Manfred Lahnstein ; Bernard Clappier , the governor of the Banque de France at the time and co-author of Robert Schuman 's Declaration in 1950 ; Alexandre Lamfalussy , who provided us with <unk w="a"/> great , almost unique expertise during the work of the committee on European monetary <unk w=","/> which we <unk w="drew"/> up <unk w="by"/> <unk w="the"/> Schmidt <unk w="to"/> relaunch the project ; Jacques Delors , President of the European <unk w="union"/> , who took over ; and , last but not least , the <unk w="countries"/> and signatories of <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="has"/> <unk w="has"/> drafted an excellent text , which has not actually been touched <unk w="upon"/> then , headed <unk w="by"/> Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President François Mitterrand , whose determination must <unk w="be"/> mentioned <unk w="in"/> particular , along with their other <unk w="colleagues"/> .

Today we must say a big ' <unk w="thank"/> you ' <unk w="and"/> all of them .

On <unk w="the"/> occasion of the 10th anniversary , <unk w="and"/> <unk w=","/> at a time of crisis , <unk w="that"/> <unk w="when"/> we say <unk w="the"/> support of the euro ?

What fine <unk w="is"/> <unk w="are"/> we <unk w="have"/> in our anniversary toasts ?

First of all , <unk w="the"/> euro 's <unk w="dangers"/> has exceeded expectations , not only of all its opponents , of course , but <unk w="instead"/> of <unk w="all"/> its <unk w="nature"/> .

I <unk w="would"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="it"/> into detail <unk w=","/> you have only given me five minutes .

During the conversations which I <unk w="disagree"/> with the <unk w="british"/> eminent monetary experts between <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> and 2000 , they were all sceptical about the possibility of introducing <unk w="new"/> <unk w="protection"/> and <unk w="make"/> it a success .

In 10 years the euro <unk w="has"/> become the number two currency in the world and , as <unk w="has"/> been mentioned just now , one of the most respected currencies .

Its sound management <unk w="has"/> <unk w="of"/> a protective shield against the crisis and a <unk w="need"/> for <unk w="economic"/> growth .

Without the <unk w="opinion"/> <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="irish"/> , mainland Europe would be currently turned upside <unk w="out"/> by a monetary tornado , which would deepen the economic crisis .

We are <unk w="not"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="to"/> try to contain , within the <unk w="framework"/> of <unk w="the"/> currency 's <unk w="existence"/> , the <unk w="environmental"/> impact of the crisis and <unk w="will"/> pave the way for the return to non-inflationary growth , which <unk w="we"/> are not tackling yet , by which time the sizeable <unk w="government"/> deficits and <unk w="which"/> of <unk w="which"/> triggered <unk w="by"/> the crisis ought to <unk w="have"/> been <unk w="done"/> .

In this respect , we are putting <unk w="the"/> <unk w="situation"/> in the managers <unk w="of"/> staff at <unk w="the"/> European Central <unk w="bank"/> , who have <unk w="had"/> their considerable <unk w="time"/> since the start of the crisis .

We <unk w="must"/> be careful not to try to give the euro a global dimension , which would flatter our vanity , but would multiply <unk w="the"/> risks we face .

The euro is Europe 's currency and must express its <unk w="own"/> culture , promoting a rational <unk w="and"/> stable model among <unk w="the"/> world <unk w="'s"/> <unk w="national"/> currencies .

Finally , I do not think that <unk w="the"/> general public will need to wait too long for banking regulation to <unk w="be"/> restored in the euro <unk w="area"/> .

It seems <unk w="to"/> me that we could call <unk w="upon"/> the European Central Bank to carry <unk w="out"/> this process <unk w="in"/> restoring order and <unk w="for"/> its <unk w="implementation"/> , according to <unk w="rule"/> 106 ( 5 ) of the Maastricht Treaty .

Indeed , we <unk w="give"/> a strong impetus , <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and a decision timetable <unk w="by"/> the European Central Bank could draw <unk w="up"/> and which the Council of Ministers <unk w="and"/> <unk w="the"/> euro <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> , presided by <unk w="the"/> good self , Mr <unk w="president"/> , could then adopt and implement .

I will conclude , Mr <unk w="president"/> , by <unk w="parliament"/> <unk w=","/> the symbol of integration <unk w="generated"/> by the euro <unk w=","/> success must give us the courage <unk w="to"/> take the next step in creating this increasingly united Europe as recommended under the various treaties and <unk w="that"/> we are endeavouring to achieve .

Let us counter the <unk w="possibility"/> of failure with <unk w="the"/> energy of success .

That success <unk w="is"/> <unk w="caused"/> by the lovely <unk w="to"/> <unk w="of"/> the euro .

Mr President , the euro <unk w="has"/> <unk w="is"/> <unk w="the"/> outcome of a vision and political will , <unk w="but"/> not the product of <unk w="the"/> market .

It demonstrates the best that Europe can achieve <unk w="by"/> everyone <unk w="market"/> forces .

I also want , <unk w="above"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , on <unk w="the"/> occasion <unk w=","/> salute and <unk w="speak"/> on our behalf , <unk w="and"/> our children <unk w="on"/> behalf and on <unk w="everyone"/> else 's behalf , the founding fathers <unk w="of"/> the architects <unk w="of"/> this success : Pierre Werner , who is with us , Chancellor Helmut Schmidt , President Giscard d 'Estaing , the President <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> European Commission Jacques Delors , <unk w="mr"/> Helmut Kohl , President François Mitterrand , Baron Alexandre Lamfalussy , <unk w="mr"/> <unk w="president"/> , <unk w="and"/> Maystadt and everyone else whom I <unk w="have"/> not mentioned .

I would also , however , like to pay tribute to <unk w="the"/> actions of <unk w="your"/> predecessors , Mr <unk w="president"/> , the actions of my predecessors , Karl von Wogau , who is <unk w="working"/> with us , <unk w="because"/> of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="people"/> , who <unk w="is"/> also with us <unk w="here"/> .

The actions <unk w="of"/> this Parliament played a crucial role in <unk w="this"/> , at <unk w="the"/> time <unk w=","/> the transition to the euro , we were <unk w="not"/> only concerned about the transfer of accounts in <unk w="central"/> banks but also about our citizens , so that they <unk w="can"/> adapt to , get used to and adopt this new currency which was going <unk w="to"/> be <unk w="made"/> .

I also believe that this action by our institution must be <unk w="effective"/> and given credit .

I am <unk w="very"/> <unk w="convinced"/> that this ceremony <unk w="will"/> take <unk w="place"/> here , in the European Parliament , the home of democracy for all Europe 's citizens .

After all , the euro is first and foremost the concern <unk w="to"/> us all , and <unk w="also"/> of the banks .

However , Europeans themselves <unk w="have"/> <unk w="that"/> the euro <unk w="as"/> a <unk w="series"/> of belonging <unk w="to"/> the European Union .

There were 11 of <unk w="us"/> to start <unk w="negotiations"/> , and now there are <unk w="problems"/> .

However , I do <unk w="have"/> the feeling <unk w="that"/> this crisis is tempting some countries <unk w="to"/> reconsider whether they should belong to the euro area or <unk w="not"/> .

I think that this is <unk w="the"/> best proof of our success .

Europe makes progress , as is so often the case , by <unk w="improving"/> its efficiency and on this occasion to mark its 10th <unk w="part-session"/> , we can clearly see that the assessment of the euro is largely a <unk w="good"/> one .

Some countries <unk w="have"/> <unk w="so"/> hesitant could now knock <unk w="on"/> the door of the euro area .

We can only encourage them <unk w="to"/> do this under the terms <unk w="of"/> the Treaty , <unk w="it"/> <unk w="has"/> never been revised and which are useful <unk w="for"/> allowing Europe to <unk w="engage"/> in economic and monetary matters <unk w="on"/> the basis <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="three"/> pillars of consolidation <unk w="of"/> enlargement .

However , an anniversary <unk w="is"/> also a time for looking <unk w="for"/> the future .

The euro , which has been enriched by these last <unk w="ten"/> years , must <unk w="be"/> <unk w="set"/> up <unk w="to"/> areas for development , not that we <unk w="have"/> not dealt with these at all , but simply because they are still work <unk w="and"/> progress ahead <unk w="with"/> us .

On the <unk w="basis"/> of economic <unk w="growth"/> , Jean-Claude Juncker described the <unk w="fact"/> that we are going through .

In this current crisis we all know that , if we had made progress in the <unk w="european"/> Union as <unk w="soon"/> as we have in the Monetary Union , we would be even <unk w="more"/> <unk w="here"/> today .

It is not normal for us to <unk w="carry"/> on the budget <unk w="and"/> balances and not on the quality of public spending .

Governments must <unk w="try"/> to talk <unk w="carefully"/> about their <unk w="common"/> policies .

It is <unk w="not"/> normal for Member <unk w="states"/> <unk w="to"/> borrow at such different rates of interest when they <unk w="become"/> the same currency and the same rate <unk w=","/> <unk w="been"/> set by <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="central"/> Bank .

The <unk w="same"/> applies when it comes to supervising the financial markets .

President Giscard d 'Estaing <unk w=","/> <unk w="rule"/> 105 ( 6 ) , which is our common <unk w="objective"/> , allowing us to make progress .

I <unk w="believe"/> that one <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="money"/> from <unk w="this"/> crisis is that <unk w="it"/> actually <unk w="means"/> that <unk w="the"/> European Central Bank will need <unk w="to"/> have a supervisory role .

We do not want to disconnect the supervision of the <unk w="turkish"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> macroprudential supervision .

However , to achieve <unk w="this"/> , we will also need , as political leaders , <unk w="i"/> think <unk w=","/> <unk w="is"/> a balance .

If the European Central Bank sees its <unk w="own"/> <unk w="role"/> , <unk w="and"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="has"/> to be <unk w="told"/> how the institutional balance on <unk w="the"/> whole needs to be established in the future .

I <unk w="would"/> like to <unk w="say"/> <unk w="the"/> final <unk w="note"/> <unk w="on"/> the <unk w="final"/> <unk w="value"/> of the euro .

I agree that we <unk w="do"/> not demand the <unk w="right"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="from"/> being the reserve currency .

However , it is <unk w="not"/> normal either <unk w="for"/> us to have taken 10 years <unk w="to"/> create the euro and then , 10 years after <unk w="the"/> transition to the euro , we are still passive <unk w="in"/> the international <unk w="community"/> and the strong <unk w="role"/> of the <unk w="child"/> is not being heard more clearly in the <unk w="context"/> of restoring some balance to the global monetary system .

This is why it is a <unk w="political"/> issue <unk w="for"/> <unk w="this"/> Parliament .

It is a tool <unk w="in"/> the service of our citizens who are going through <unk w="the"/> deepest crisis in years .

We must then <unk w=","/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="job"/> creation , this symbol <unk w="of"/> Europe to help our citizens come through this crisis in the <unk w="new"/> conditions possible .

<unk w="mr"/> President , <unk w="after"/> years <unk w="before"/> the euro is indeed a reason to celebrate .

Anyone <unk w="who"/> <unk w="been"/> said <unk w="ten"/> years ago <unk w=","/> the euro <unk w="has"/> <unk w="has"/> developed <unk w="and"/> splendidly as it has done would have been laughed at .

Many people have contributed to this success , and I remember <unk w="some"/> sceptical voices - it was referred to as a premature <unk w="declaration"/> and an unviable project - and today <unk w="i"/> know that it was a vision to which many people contributed .

The previous <unk w="report"/> <unk w="reminded"/> us of all those who contributed to this , of the milestones , of the European monetary system , which was an <unk w="agreement"/> with the European Central Bank <unk w="to"/> create central rates , of the Delors report , which provided <unk w="by"/> the introduction of <unk w="the"/> monetary union in three stages , of <unk w="the"/> Treaty of <unk w="amsterdam"/> - <unk w="for"/> two years <unk w="after"/> the <unk w="whole"/> of the <unk w="commission"/> - and of <unk w="the"/> transitional periods .

Many <unk w="countries"/> have <unk w="tried"/> to make the <unk w="way"/> the successful project it is today .

As the committee chairman , Mrs Berès , has already <unk w="said"/> , <unk w="for"/> this period , in particular <unk w="in"/> 1994 when the implementation of the Treaty of Maastricht <unk w="does"/> , and up <unk w="to"/> 2002 , Parliament <unk w="is"/> <unk w=","/> in the introduction of the notes <unk w="and"/> coins , and in many reports , discussions , opinions and also proposals , and I <unk w="should"/> like specifically to thank the two committee chairmen from that time , Mr <unk w="president"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> Mrs Randzio-Plath , who <unk w="has"/> represented Parliament <unk w="and"/> the outside world and <unk w="i"/> gave this project , although originally created by <unk w="the"/> governments , the parliamentary support <unk w="is"/> needed .

<unk w="we"/> are working <unk w="together"/> , too , under the chairmanship <unk w="of"/> Mrs Berès , for the same representation .

On 18 November Parliament adopted , with a large majority , a report in which we describe the <unk w="approach"/> , challenges , risks and problems , and I <unk w="would"/> like to mention just a few things in addition to what Mrs Berès <unk w="has"/> <unk w="said"/> .

The euro has <unk w="been"/> a great success , and it <unk w="is"/> a <unk w="good"/> project : a central monetary policy under the <unk w="control"/> of the European Central Bank and local budgetary <unk w="authorities"/> <unk w="development"/> policies .

It is important that , in future , the <unk w="cooperation"/> between these two levels of responsibility in the <unk w="stability"/> and Growth Pact are retained <unk w=","/> during times of crisis .

Without this Stability and Growth Pact , without stronger coordination <unk w="between"/> <unk w="the"/> budgetary and finance <unk w="programmes"/> , the euro <unk w="is"/> also in <unk w="the"/> face risks that are avoidable .

In <unk w="this"/> regard , I appeal <unk w="in"/> particular to the Member States of the euro area , but also to the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> , to <unk w="achieve"/> this discipline , this <unk w="is"/> cooperation , <unk w="more"/> seriously than has <unk w="been"/> <unk w="the"/> case <unk w="in"/> the past in <unk w="accordance"/> with certain issues .

<unk w="the"/> euro has pushed <unk w="out"/> inflation considerably and <unk w="has"/> created confidence and stability , and it has become the second most commonly held reserve currency in a space of time that no one <unk w="is"/> <unk w="is"/> capable of .

The euro has increased <unk w="under"/> pressure for structural reform in the <unk w="member"/> States and therefore , <unk w="especially"/> in the <unk w="process"/> of globalisation , has become a ' <unk w="peace"/> programme ' for undertakings and for nations .

The institutions of the euro area - several were mentioned <unk w="by"/> the previous speaker - the Ecofin <unk w="council"/> , the <unk w="socialist"/> Group <unk w="and"/> many other institutions have <unk w="set"/> the necessary conditions <unk w="associated"/> with the Commission and the European Central <unk w="bank"/> , because they were already operating , because they were in place , because they <unk w="decide"/> independently in order to react <unk w="speedily"/> , reliably and correctly in the <unk w="current"/> crisis .

We have experienced the euro as a lever for creating a <unk w="single"/> financial market .

The political <unk w="imbalance"/> from <unk w="the"/> common successes is that states with a <unk w="single"/> currency <unk w="and"/> a common internal market <unk w="and"/> achieved a unique level of integration that will secure peace and prosperity .

However , we cannot necessarily take <unk w="the"/> euro for <unk w="all"/> in future .

There are numerous specific requests and demands to take the risks seriously : the <unk w="situation"/> apart of the national economies , which is associated with considerable <unk w="concern"/> in connection with the <unk w="creation"/> of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="cooperation"/> with budget deficits , should <unk w="not"/> be concealed on this anniversary .

An entirely different aspect <unk w="of"/> the varying development of the interest rates for <unk w="human"/> bonds .

We are <unk w="also"/> <unk w="in"/> the interest rate margin , which has no doubt <unk w="been"/> , increasing again , bringing the possibility <unk w="of"/> new problems in this regard for individual Member States within the <unk w="member"/> <unk w="union"/> .

I would remind the House that , <unk w="in"/> in connection with the <unk w="creation"/> of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="free-trade"/> area , no special rebates may be given and that all states that are members <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> euro area can , and must , <unk w="also"/> <unk w="that"/> these conditions of the Treaty of Maastricht .

It has passed the first test <unk w="which"/> has provided a unique contribution <unk w="to"/> <unk w="the"/> permanent integration of our nations in Europe .

Mr President , Mr Giscard d <unk w="burg"/> , <unk w="schmidt"/> Juncker , Mr Trichet , Mr Almunia , ladies and gentlemen , many <unk w="other"/> points have already been <unk w="mentioned"/> .

In 10 years , the euro <unk w="has"/> become a strong symbol for Europe .

Yet the idea that Europe could create a single currency , whose foundations were <unk w=","/> especially in <unk w="the"/> Bremen agreement on the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="process"/> in 1978 and the creation of <unk w="a"/> ecu , would have been met at the time with scepticism from the markets and the <unk w="international"/> monetary <unk w="union"/> outside Europe .

We should warmly <unk w="congratulate"/> and congratulate all those who made the <unk w="comments"/> <unk w=","/> whose names have been mentioned here .

The creation of the euro is the <unk w="only"/> proof that Europe is capable , <unk w="but"/> the political will , to take long-term decisions for a <unk w="democratic"/> , prosperous future .

<unk w="the"/> anniversary , then , gives us a <unk w="very"/> apt message of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="europe"/> 's <unk w="party"/> .

It must be <unk w="said"/> , however , <unk w="to"/> <unk w="by"/> our fellow <unk w="citizens"/> and until recently there were <unk w="no"/> perceptions of the euro .

<unk w="all"/> those who travel , <unk w="the"/> advantage of a single currency was obvious .

For those who do not , the euro was associated with price <unk w="stability"/> .

Studies have , in fact , shown that in most countries inflation was felt even though <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> figures showed that , due especially to the <unk w="objective"/> <unk w="of"/> the European Central <unk w="bank"/> , monetary stability had been <unk w="adopted"/> .

The reality is that some <unk w="people"/> took <unk w="advantage"/> of the euro to <unk w="set"/> up some prices and perhaps <unk w="we"/> were not vigilant <unk w="either"/> .

When the euro <unk w="has"/> risen against the dollar , we have also heard comments from some <unk w="members"/> who for <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="to"/> produce in the <unk w="free-trade"/> area but sell <unk w="them"/> this area .

The European Central Bank has not been without its critics , who <unk w="has"/> <unk w="be"/> called <unk w="to"/> <unk w="for"/> its independence but rather its policy on interest rates , which seemed to be too high .

We all understand that the euro is a <unk w="key"/> factor in restricting the <unk w="environmental"/> repercussions of a crisis <unk w="resulting"/> from the United States .

The European Central Bank has certainly been the most <unk w="important"/> <unk w="central"/> bank .

What would <unk w="the"/> situation have been if the various Member States had each had to <unk w="do"/> their <unk w="own"/> individual currency ?

The welcome results of <unk w="the"/> euro must encourage us to continue and to <unk w="improve"/> the coordination of economic policies and <unk w="to"/> respect the principles of the Stability and Growth Pact .

It is true , <unk w="at"/> present , that exceptions may and perhaps should be accepted , but they can only be temporary and <unk w="the"/> objective of balanced public finances must be <unk w="defined"/> .

High-quality public finances and economic <unk w="policy"/> <unk w="are"/> , in fact , <unk w="in"/> the long run , <unk w="more"/> than ever necessary .

They are <unk w="a"/> condition for <unk w="the"/> solidity of our currency , the euro .

<unk w="mr"/> President , during these <unk w="years"/> <unk w="legal"/> uncertainty , it is important to <unk w="be"/> able to count <unk w="on"/> <unk w=","/> with a reliable value : the <unk w="consumer"/> .

As I was able to <unk w="see"/> a bit-part as a member of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="member"/> <unk w=","/> during <unk w="the"/> <unk w="period"/> of preparation <unk w="for"/> the future single currency , I <unk w="have"/> <unk w="have"/> the doubts on both sides of the argument and the <unk w="governments"/> of <unk w="the"/> Member States , which ultimately made the Eurogroup into a stronger forum for cooperation <unk w="and"/> of its time .

Furthermore , two of Europe 's finest achievements came about through the determination of a few <unk w="countries"/> <unk w="to"/> forge ahead <unk w="by"/> making <unk w="it"/> <unk w="is"/> real for all <unk w="our"/> fellow <unk w="citizens"/> .

I am referring to <unk w="the"/> Schengen Agreement entailing the free movement <unk w="of"/> <unk w="persons"/> , which was implemented <unk w="in"/> the initiative of five states : France , with President <unk w="prodi"/> , Germany , <unk w="the"/> Chancellor Kohl , along <unk w="with"/> <unk w="the"/> Benelux countries .

Switzerland has now become <unk w="part"/> of the Schengen <unk w="agreement"/> , but the British and <unk w="spanish"/> <unk w="are"/> still shying away <unk w="from"/> <unk w="the"/> people 's Europe .

President Mitterrand and Chancellor Kohl were also the political architects of <unk w="the"/> euro , even though there were many who supported this monetary success , starting <unk w="with"/> <unk w="jacques"/> Delors .

The first <unk w="point"/> I would <unk w="like"/> to <unk w="hear"/> from this is that anyone <unk w="who"/> wants a better Europe must not be afraid <unk w="of"/> intergovernmental action , especially if <unk w="there"/> is a coalition of states <unk w="and"/> really <unk w="a"/> <unk w="to"/> move <unk w="it"/> forward .

The Prüm Treaty , <unk w="it"/> is <unk w="possible"/> <unk w="to"/> combat <unk w="organised"/> crime , is <unk w="an"/> example of this <unk w="and"/> <unk w="of"/> cooperation for Europe .

<unk w="at"/> a time when the Constitutional Treaty is dead <unk w="and"/> buried , following the ' <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> ' <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> a strange coalition <unk w="of"/> political forces not only in <unk w="europe"/> but in the Netherlands too , and when the indigestible piece of legislation known as the ' <unk w="eu"/> ' Treaty of Lisbon is being blocked in Ireland and possibly <unk w="by"/> the Czech Republic as <unk w="well"/> , we <unk w="must"/> prove <unk w="that"/> <unk w="there"/> is still functioning by relying on the huge area <unk w="of"/> enhanced cooperation .

In any case , the attraction of the euro <unk w="is"/> <unk w="""/> .

Others are <unk w="talking"/> about not being able to benefit <unk w="themselves"/> from the protective shield provided by the euro .

Even in the UK voices are being <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , questioning the country 's splendid isolation in the face of the pound 's <unk w="approach"/> , <unk w="it"/> has seen its <unk w="dramatic"/> fall from that of the world 's reserve currency to a run-of-the-mill currency in less than a <unk w="result"/> .

<unk w="according"/> to the consistent <unk w="position"/> of Wim Duisenberg , Jean-Claude Trichet and the likes , the euro has become the world <unk w="and"/> <unk w="a"/> reserve currency in 10 years .

Of course , the dollar <unk w="'s"/> king for global <unk w="union"/> , still providing a safe <unk w="premium"/> , but the colossal debts accumulated by the United States in getting the rest of the world <unk w="and"/> finance their lifestyle will increasingly sow <unk w="the"/> seeds of doubt as to the <unk w="complexity"/> of the number one <unk w="of"/> power to honour its commitments .

In fact , the <unk w="commission"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> tending towards a euro / dollar <unk w="""/> .

Any monetary <unk w="policy"/> regularly goes through parity adjustments which <unk w="may"/> occur <unk w="again"/> .

<unk w="in"/> these times of widespread recession , <unk w="the"/> world needs stability and new <unk w="technologies"/> .

The euro <unk w="has"/> <unk w="be"/> a key <unk w="role"/> to play <unk w="in"/> this new stability .

The <unk w="european"/> Central Bank ( ECB ) has done what it needed <unk w="to"/> do in the face <unk w="of"/> a global <unk w="market"/> crisis ' made in the <unk w="eu"/> ' .

As Jacques Delors said , the <unk w="commission"/> is the shield to protect <unk w="the"/> <unk w="citizens"/> of <unk w="women"/> , but the <unk w="situation"/> has not stimulated the European economy enough so far .

<unk w="at"/> <unk w="the"/> end of the <unk w="day"/> , the Commission is only a first-class consultant making suggestions which <unk w="are"/> generally useful , but the real economic players remain the states themselves which , <unk w="unfortunately"/> , <unk w="be"/> operating in a <unk w="new"/> <unk w="way"/> .

Although <unk w="the"/> effective <unk w="implementation"/> of the cumulative economic power <unk w="that"/> 27 states could work miracles , the Eurogroup , <unk w="and"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="on"/> the commendable efforts of Jean-Claude <unk w="luis"/> , still only remains an informal <unk w="political"/> group .

In the spring of 1999 , I was able to witness <unk w="the"/> attempt made within the Eurogroup by a few <unk w="foreign"/> ministers , including Oskar Lafontaine , <unk w="the"/> Strauss-Kahn , <unk w="the"/> Ciampi and a few <unk w="days"/> , <unk w="to"/> establish economic and monetary cooperation <unk w="between"/> the European Union and <unk w="the"/> European Central Bank .

Wim Duisenberg made the cutting retort : ' there never will be any ex-ante <unk w=","/> with the European Central <unk w="bank"/> as you are always <unk w="going"/> <unk w="to"/> have to react <unk w="carefully"/> to our decisions . '

The reason <unk w="for"/> this is obvious : the ECB is and will <unk w="be"/> independent in conducting its <unk w="development"/> policy , <unk w="but"/> independence does not mean a ban on constructive dialogue between institutions tasked with <unk w="all"/> the interests and common destiny of 500 million Europeans .

There is nothing to prevent <unk w="people"/> from organising themselves <unk w="with"/> <unk w="with"/> regard to achieving proper coordination of their <unk w="common"/> policies , whether it is inside the EU or <unk w=","/> when representing Europe externally , as Jean-Claude Juncker so sensibly concluded just now .

Mr President , Mr <unk w="costa"/> d <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , Mr <unk w="miranda"/> , <unk w="martin"/> Trichet , Mr Almunia , ladies and gentlemen , I find it very regrettable that relatively few Members <unk w="have"/> <unk w="here"/> today for this formal sitting , because it really <unk w="is"/> a historic event .

<unk w="we"/> have already heard <unk w="that"/> the various <unk w="previous"/> speakers how much scepticism there was when the euro was first introduced .

<unk w="the"/> <unk w="we"/> felt that <unk w="the"/> logistical challenges involved <unk w="in"/> introducing <unk w="millions"/> of banknotes and coins alone <unk w="cannot"/> be unmanageable , and the idea that <unk w="it"/> could <unk w="have"/> a common <unk w="foreign"/> policy with <unk w="the"/> fiscal policies in the Member <unk w="states"/> <unk w="have"/> seen not just <unk w="as"/> a major challenge but as simply impossible .

European <unk w="union"/> <unk w="there"/> is a reality ; the euro has been in existence for 10 years today .

This is something <unk w="of"/> a minor political <unk w="issue"/> , and once again <unk w="the"/> words of Walter <unk w="outbreak"/> , the first President of the Commission , have proven to be <unk w="said"/> : ' Anyone who does not believe in miracles in European matters <unk w="is"/> not a <unk w="solution"/> . '

The doubts of the citizens , many of whom , in <unk w="the"/> Member States , initially believed that the euro would result in huge <unk w="economic"/> hikes , have now disappeared .

The <unk w="report"/> has <unk w="already"/> been accepted , and <unk w="was"/> enthusiastically welcomed by many citizens .

It <unk w="has"/> become something <unk w="of"/> a visible European identifier : besides <unk w="the"/> anthem <unk w="flying"/> the flag , it <unk w="is"/> one of the few <unk w="things"/> we have today .

It could , I think , be said that , <unk w="as"/> the <unk w="european"/> Central Bank 's first few <unk w="years"/> , Europe and the <unk w="irish"/> economy were sailing in <unk w="a"/> calm <unk w="way"/> , <unk w="given"/> that the bank found it <unk w="not"/> easy to pursue a <unk w="policy"/> of stability .

Even so , <unk w="it"/> is worth pointing out <unk w="what"/> the mean inflation rate over the first <unk w="ten"/> years of the <unk w="eu"/> has <unk w="been"/> approximately 2 % , <unk w="or"/> other <unk w=","/> more or <unk w="less"/> on the <unk w="pretext"/> that the European <unk w="central"/> Bank set <unk w="up"/> .

The German mark , on the other <unk w="hand"/> , which <unk w="will"/> <unk w="been"/> held up as a poster child for stability , had a <unk w="low"/> inflation rate of 3 % over its 50 years of existence .

It can <unk w="only"/> be <unk w="clear"/> that the European Central Bank has performed very well .

<unk w="however"/> , it is <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , <unk w="for"/> this time <unk w=","/> <unk w="time"/> , that the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="central"/> Bank is showing its true strength , its true quality .

<unk w="it"/> has proven itself to be <unk w="transparent"/> , efficient and self-confident , <unk w="because"/> it acts decisively and quickly .

It <unk w="has"/> become an <unk w="example"/> for some <unk w="central"/> banks , both in those European <unk w="countries"/> that are not yet part of the euro area and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="it"/> .

It has <unk w="made"/> it quite clear to the Federal Reserve in the United States <unk w="and"/> <unk w="continue"/> <unk w="to"/> pursue a successful policy , not despite its independence but precisely because <unk w="it"/> is politically independent and not <unk w="to"/> <unk w="dubious"/> instructions from various governments .

We now know <unk w="that"/> <unk w="at"/> <unk w="the"/> moment , after the <unk w="individual"/> sectors in <unk w="the"/> individual Member States have been brought <unk w="through"/> a protective umbrella , the Member States are in <unk w="the"/> process of developing various economic stimulus plans to absorb the negative impact of the financial crisis <unk w="to"/> <unk w="the"/> real economy .

This <unk w="will"/> present the European <unk w="central"/> Bank with further challenges , because <unk w="there"/> is a risk that <unk w="the"/> <unk w="this"/> <unk w="this"/> approach will result in distortions of competition , and <unk w="in"/> the convergence <unk w="criteria"/> have , in part , <unk w="has"/> achieved between the <unk w="countries"/> of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="free-trade"/> area will <unk w="be"/> lost and we will see increasingly divergent <unk w="interests"/> .

This <unk w="would"/> <unk w="must"/> be counteracted , which is why it is so crucial and so <unk w="is"/> that <unk w="the"/> Stability <unk w="and"/> Growth <unk w="will"/> <unk w="will"/> not be undermined or discarded .

Quite the reverse : we must ensure that <unk w="it"/> remains valid .

<unk w="that"/> is why it <unk w="is"/> also so important <unk w="that"/> the necessary structural reforms , <unk w="both"/> the <unk w="commission"/> and the European Central Bank <unk w="has"/> repeatedly called for in the past , actually to be pursued in the <unk w="individual"/> Member States .

The European Central Bank <unk w="will"/> gain a new <unk w="interest"/> in the coming years .

<unk w="this"/> crisis has <unk w="been"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> we need some kind <unk w="of"/> European <unk w="harmonisation"/> of <unk w="the"/> financial market , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="this"/> is an area where <unk w="the"/> European Central Bank can play a major role .

It has signalled <unk w="that"/> it <unk w="is"/> , in principle , willing to <unk w="show"/> some kind of central European supervisory <unk w="authority"/> <unk w="prior"/> to the European System of Central Banks .

The euro area <unk w="is"/> to speak with one voice , and also be represented as a unit in international organisations such as the International Monetary Fund and <unk w="the"/> OECD ( <unk w="search"/> for Economic Co-operation and Development ) .

<unk w="it"/> is still true <unk w="of"/> a single currency without a single fiscal <unk w="audiovisual"/> policy is , and <unk w="will"/> continue <unk w="to"/> <unk w="fact"/> , a risky undertaking .

The <unk w="problem"/> <unk w="are"/> still facing some major challenges : we <unk w="are"/> facing high , <unk w="high-quality"/> <unk w="is"/> rising , levels of unemployment , demographic changes , migratory pressures , increasing poverty in some sectors of society , <unk w="the"/> stiffer <unk w=","/> in the <unk w="process"/> of globalisation .

The euro <unk w="system"/> will only be able to meet these challenges if the economic policies of the <unk w="member"/> States can be more closely <unk w="coordinated"/> .

<unk w="the"/> appointment of a president <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> euro area was the first step in <unk w="this"/> direction , but it is only the <unk w="first"/> step : more is now <unk w="possible"/> .

Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , after 10 years , <unk w="a"/> growing space carved out by the <unk w="eu"/> in international trade and its use as a <unk w="single"/> currency show that it has become a <unk w="good"/> benchmark .

It <unk w="has"/> <unk w="that"/> monetary stability <unk w="which"/> has helped <unk w="improve"/> the economies of the Member States that have adopted it , despite <unk w="the"/> errors of judgment <unk w="and"/> <unk w="the"/> problems for citizens both because of the actual exchange <unk w="of"/> <unk w="between"/> <unk w="national"/> currencies and the euro and because of the <unk w="spot"/> checks subsequently carried out on the prices of goods and services .

The euro was created without being imposed from outside and <unk w="without"/> any <unk w="of"/> <unk w=","/> conquest or <unk w="the"/> hegemonies .

It was the result of <unk w="the"/> free coming together of 11 <unk w=","/> who <unk w="is"/> in <unk w="the"/> creation of an economic and monetary union , <unk w="as"/> laid down in the <unk w="treaty"/> , as an essential step in attempting to achieve the political union that still unfortunately remains out of our <unk w="opinion"/> .

Some problems that have occurred are <unk w="due"/> to <unk w="us"/> <unk w="in"/> a system that was unprepared for the task of guiding <unk w="and"/> other great associated phenomenon ; I <unk w="am"/> talking about the increasing <unk w="number"/> of internationalisation and <unk w="the"/> great changes in the way trade is conducted at international level .

The euro has made it possible to face up to a <unk w="series"/> of difficulties , the most severe of which <unk w="in"/> the current <unk w="economic"/> crisis , and it <unk w="has"/> protected us <unk w=","/> the <unk w="report"/> stresses that have ravaged the <unk w="commission"/> .

Were it not for <unk w="the"/> <unk w="albanians"/> , we would have repeated the experience of 1992 , <unk w="even"/> worse .

<unk w="i"/> <unk w="despite"/> this 10th <unk w="report"/> by warmly welcoming the entrance of Slovakia , the 16th country to join the euro area .

The measures introduced by the European Central Bank ( <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> ) and the <unk w="measures"/> to combat the <unk w="bse"/> crisis have acted as a buffer and a <unk w="very"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> we still <unk w="have"/> , as we have often done in this Chamber , that <unk w="it"/> <unk w="it"/> <unk w="is"/> inconceivable to have a <unk w="consistent"/> policy disconnected from economic policy .

Admittedly , the <unk w="current"/> situation is somewhat anomalous : 16 Member <unk w="states"/> with the <unk w="single"/> currency , 27 national economic policies coordinated <unk w="by"/> the Commission as well as it <unk w="were"/> , <unk w="the"/> 11 Member States with national currencies .

<unk w="creating"/> a monetary policy with an <unk w="economic"/> policy <unk w="which"/> <unk w="does"/> not actually exist is certainly no mean <unk w="that"/> , <unk w="so"/> <unk w="that"/> the institutions responsible for economic <unk w="growth"/> in our countries <unk w="do"/> not communicate with the central banks and <unk w="the"/> ECB , <unk w="it"/> has to <unk w="throw"/> all those policies together , and <unk w="vice"/> versa , <unk w="the"/> European Union will find new difficulties in <unk w="the"/> facing up <unk w="to"/> the current crisis <unk w="but"/> also the <unk w="new"/> challenges that the outside world and globalisation bring <unk w="it"/> to us .

We hope that recent experiences <unk w="and"/> people of the need to face up to change in Europe , restoring the real economy to the centre <unk w="of"/> ensuring <unk w="the"/> <unk w="safety"/> and <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> and the European institutions responsible for laying down political and <unk w="economic"/> <unk w="rules"/> .

<unk w="the"/> very <unk w="much"/> energy crisis has <unk w="already"/> <unk w="to"/> us that a common <unk w="position"/> <unk w="policy"/> on <unk w="the"/> main strategic <unk w="objective"/> is <unk w="of"/> <unk w="great"/> interest to <unk w="the"/> public and <unk w="cannot"/> be delayed .

If the <unk w="commission"/> will is <unk w="concerned"/> , the introduction of such a <unk w="premium"/> will be facilitated by the growing power <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> euro .

Mr President , Mr Giscard d <unk w="burg"/> , Mr Juncker , Mr Trichet , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to remind <unk w="you"/> how , in 1992 , when it was still completely dubious as <unk w="to"/> whether the French <unk w="will"/> vote in favour of the Maastricht <unk w="treaty"/> , Jacques Delors spoke to <unk w="the"/> general assembly <unk w=","/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> Green Party , which managed to deliver <unk w="a"/> missing 1 % or 2 % .

<unk w="i"/> said to <unk w="you"/> : ' Vote <unk w="on"/> the euro , then we will have a <unk w="new"/> Europe , <unk w="even"/> if we do not create a political Europe to control Europe , the people <unk w="do"/> not <unk w="do"/> it ; they will never accept it . '

<unk w="the"/> Maastricht Treaty was approved , but <unk w="nobody"/> <unk w="in"/> Europe was <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .

This is the <unk w="only"/> problem which we are <unk w="debating"/> today .

Firstly , <unk w="it"/> seemed to us that the Maastricht criteria were going to <unk w="integrate"/> Europe into <unk w="the"/> least five years of pro-cyclical recessionary policy and , secondly , the <unk w="situation"/> in <unk w="which"/> the monetary policy <unk w="has"/> incorporated <unk w="in"/> the general economic policy by the Maastricht Treaty <unk w="to"/> <unk w="very"/> satisfactory .

For the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="european"/> Central Bank 's independence , we would separate monetary <unk w="policy"/> from the rest of the policies .

I must say quite honestly that , even if I am still not convinced by <unk w="the"/> Maastricht Treaty today , like <unk w="all"/> the other Greens , I am rather attracted by the changes which the <unk w="scope"/> and application of Economic and <unk w="social"/> <unk w="industries"/> have undergone .

At the moment , when the <unk w="disease"/> is <unk w="being"/> threatened by deflation and the situation <unk w="currently"/> being aggravated by the tendency of some <unk w="people"/> to hastily cut their VAT <unk w=","/> as part of a Keynesian policy , it is obvious that setting this target of 2 % is <unk w="not"/> <unk w="not"/> just <unk w="to"/> show .

If we fail <unk w="to"/> keep to this 2 % <unk w=","/> we <unk w="run"/> the risk of having very <unk w="much"/> real <unk w="effect"/> rates being forced on us .

<unk w="the"/> <unk w="this"/> major reform is obviously <unk w="the"/> reform of the Stability and Growth <unk w="pact"/> carried out in 2005 , which allows us today <unk w="to"/> <unk w="have"/> a policy that is contracyclical and aimed at countering the crisis .

The third major transformation <unk w="is"/> the change to <unk w="do"/> things work in practice .

<unk w="a"/> permanent dialogue , as highlighted once again in this Chamber , <unk w="like"/> Mr Trichet , <unk w="mr"/> Almunia , Mr Juncker and Mr <unk w="costa"/> , is , strictly <unk w="speaking"/> , contrary <unk w="to"/> the <unk w="maastricht"/> Treaty itself .

I regard this form of <unk w="link"/> between <unk w="the"/> Trichet and Mr <unk w="kinnock"/> , for example , to <unk w="clarify"/> the <unk w="problem"/> of that between Mr Bernanke and <unk w="the"/> Paulson , which is a positive and desirable development .

All I <unk w="am"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="this"/> <unk w="when"/> we <unk w="have"/> to apply properly <unk w="in"/> good <unk w="use"/> of the Maastricht <unk w="treaty"/> .

<unk w="we"/> have a real <unk w="problem"/> in defining the exchange rate , <unk w="which"/> <unk w="has"/> been mentioned on several occasions by <unk w="our"/> predecessors .

The task of setting <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="which"/> is assigned <unk w="to"/> the Council .

We must <unk w="use"/> the means to ensure that <unk w="the"/> Council sets <unk w="the"/> exchange rate for Europe which does not derive randomly from <unk w="the"/> <unk w="interest"/> rate chosen by the European Central Bank , but properly <unk w="on"/> an industrial policy .

<unk w="however"/> , the European Central Bank 's <unk w="commitment"/> is not only to maintain a <unk w="minimum"/> <unk w="up"/> to 2 % but also to apply Europe <unk w="'s"/> policy , by that I mean the Lisbon <unk w="and"/> Gothenburg Strategies .

We need to have a policy <unk w="of"/> refinancing and rediscounting private <unk w="sector"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> <unk w=","/> according to the Gothenburg and Lisbon Strategies .

Lastly , as has already been mentioned , there needs to be supervision at a European <unk w="level"/> and the European Central Bank <unk w="is"/> in the <unk w="common"/> position to perform this <unk w="position"/> .

It is regrettable that we <unk w="are"/> not taking <unk w="place"/> <unk w="of"/> this opportunity <unk w="for"/> an in-depth examination of the consequences of implementing <unk w="terrorism"/> and monetarist <unk w="measures"/> - using <unk w="the"/> euro as an excuse - which have contributed to the current <unk w="european"/> social situation and to increasing <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , unemployment , precarious and poorly paid <unk w="out"/> , <unk w="and"/> poverty .

It <unk w="is"/> <unk w="clear"/> that we are <unk w="forced"/> onto <unk w="the"/> dogmas , such as price stability and the <unk w="political"/> criteria of <unk w="the"/> Stability and Growth Pact , which are being used as a pretext <unk w="for"/> <unk w="order"/> to pursue privatisation and remove <unk w="it"/> for social <unk w="protection"/> from <unk w="the"/> state .

This approach also involves the <unk w="inclusion"/> of the minimal state <unk w="and"/> the greater efficiency of <unk w="the"/> private sector , with the aim of imposing acceptance of so-called wage restraint , which actually results in low , nominal <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> and even a reduction <unk w="in"/> real wages , as the Portuguese case <unk w="of"/> <unk w="it"/> demonstrates .

We cannot agree with the false independence of the European <unk w="central"/> Bank , <unk w="and"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="and"/> its heels <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="need"/> to reduce <unk w="interest"/> rates and <unk w="it"/> is keeping <unk w="the"/> euro overvalued solely to <unk w="all"/> those countries with <unk w="less"/> developed economies and the <unk w="most"/> powerful economic and financial groups , thus worsening the hardships of the <unk w="new"/> fragile economies and those people with fewer financial resources .

This European Central <unk w="bank"/> <unk w="also"/> has resulted in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="competitiveness"/> of <unk w="the"/> European economy , clearly demonstrating the need for further reductions in the reference interest <unk w="issues"/> .

As the purchasing <unk w="power"/> of workers , the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w=","/> has <unk w=","/> over <unk w="the"/> last 10 years , <unk w="the"/> profits <unk w="for"/> economic and financial <unk w="interests"/> <unk w="have"/> reached their highest <unk w="level"/> in 30 years , <unk w="both"/> in the joy and satisfaction <unk w="that"/> we have heard <unk w="about"/> this <unk w="afternoon"/> .

Even now , in the crisis situation <unk w=","/> <unk w="we"/> have <unk w="been"/> , what they are <unk w="doing"/> is nationalising the damage in <unk w="order"/> to then privatise <unk w="their"/> profits , whilst workers , micro- <unk w=","/> small entrepreneurs , the <unk w="large"/> and <unk w="the"/> unemployed suffer the consequences of the crisis , with the right , in the best-case scenario , <unk w="according"/> to a <unk w="european"/> scraps .

Look at what is happening in the financial sector , where certain banks have already increased their spreads more than once since the start of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="current"/> crisis and where <unk w="the"/> margin charged has doubled in the <unk w="course"/> of a year , thereby penalising new credit even more .

We <unk w="must"/> insist <unk w="that"/> the <unk w="urgent"/> need for a proper <unk w="dialogue"/> with these neoliberal and monetarist policies , <unk w="to"/> an end <unk w="to"/> the <unk w="new"/> <unk w="chain"/> , tax havens and the <unk w="financial"/> independence of the European Central Bank .

We therefore insist on the need <unk w="to"/> significantly increase the EU budget <unk w="line"/> on a fair distribution of income and wealth , so that there <unk w="is"/> a real policy <unk w="of"/> <unk w="economic"/> and social cohesion and so that we reject <unk w="measures"/> that are just more <unk w="of"/> the same , <unk w="in"/> <unk w="the"/> words ' save <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> you can ' measures , allowing <unk w="the"/> richest to become ever richer and the poor <unk w="have"/> become ever poorer , as clearly demonstrated by <unk w="the"/> increasing inequalities and disparities <unk w="in"/> the euro area economies .

We therefore insist on the <unk w="need"/> to support production and <unk w="training"/> , small and medium-sized enterprises ; to promote quality public services ; to <unk w="ensure"/> <unk w="it"/> <unk w="to"/> improve <unk w="their"/> purchasing <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , and <unk w="not"/> just the <unk w="most"/> disadvantaged , but <unk w="also"/> the <unk w="working"/> classes ; <unk w="they"/> create more jobs , and to reduce the poverty and misery of <unk w="millions"/> of people in <unk w="third"/> countries .

on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Mr President , do enjoy the 10th birthday of the euro because I very much doubt you <unk w="will"/> be celebrating the 20th .

What we <unk w="have"/> <unk w="in"/> <unk w="this"/> morning <unk w="is"/> <unk w="is"/> reminiscent of the <unk w="former"/> Soviet times .

Do you remember when the <unk w="greek"/> <unk w="talks"/> were announced to be successes often before they were <unk w="not"/> <unk w="and"/> , with much talk <unk w="of"/> record harvests and wonderful production figures for tractors ?

Much <unk w="of"/> those days , <unk w="we"/> have <unk w="been"/> treated this morning to a succession <unk w="of"/> <unk w="war"/> , ageing bureaucrats telling us what a great success the whole thing has been .

The idea that the <unk w="commission"/> has done a good job is extraordinary .

It <unk w="is"/> last July when the European Central Bank put <unk w="forward"/> <unk w="it"/> up , <unk w="but"/> at the very moment that the <unk w="directives"/> were <unk w="translated"/> into <unk w="everything"/> and rates were being slashed <unk w="by"/> the rest of the world .

<unk w="of"/> course none <unk w="of"/> this surprises me because what <unk w="the"/> euro <unk w="is"/> all <unk w="happening"/> is a political class imposing its will upon the peoples of Europe .

Remember that only two countries - <unk w="denmark"/> and Sweden - had a referendum on the euro and both of them <unk w="or"/> ' no ' , that little <unk w="is"/> <unk w="can"/> you try and avoid <unk w="what"/> you possibly can .

<unk w="the"/> euro zone has never been tested but it is about to <unk w="say"/> .

Italy , as German economists at the time said , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="we"/> have joined the euro , but the <unk w="situation"/> in Greece <unk w="is"/> , I think , where <unk w="we"/> should <unk w="pay"/> <unk w="my"/> attention .

Thousands of young people out on the <unk w="ground"/> demonstrating , demanding <unk w="the"/> government <unk w="is"/> something , <unk w="and"/> <unk w="that"/> their government cuts rates , <unk w="so"/> that their government devalues .

<unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> Greek Government is stuck <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="process"/> .

There is nothing that a future general election can do <unk w="with"/> Greece to <unk w="do"/> anything .

<unk w="these"/> people have taken away from <unk w="all"/> the ability <unk w="to"/> determine their own futures through the ballot box , then I am afraid that violence becomes the only <unk w="possible"/> alternative .

<unk w="as"/> you have done with this euro is <unk w="to"/> have trapped people in an <unk w="isolated"/> prison .

You <unk w="are"/> trapped people in a Völkerkerker <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> it will take <unk w="the"/> courage to <unk w="be"/> <unk w="it"/> .

It will take leadership , <unk w="and"/> possibly the <unk w="european"/> economic meltdown .

You can boo , you can <unk w="see"/> , but remember this : Britain <unk w=","/> of the euro has been able <unk w="to"/> devalue , has been able to slash interest rates .

We have been able <unk w="to"/> do the things that we <unk w="have"/> to do .

Jeer <unk w=","/> <unk w="thank"/> you like , but have <unk w="been"/> <unk w="been"/> <unk w="out"/> on the bond markets this morning Greek <unk w="who"/> are trading 233 basis points higher than German bonds ?

Now I <unk w="think"/> that most <unk w="of"/> you <unk w="see"/> this room <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> even <unk w="though"/> what that <unk w="is"/> <unk w="is"/> those that do will do their best to ignore it .

You can go on burying <unk w="their"/> heads <unk w="of"/> the sand <unk w="on"/> you <unk w="mentioned"/> .

<unk w="we"/> can ignore the markets if <unk w="we"/> want to , <unk w="even"/> in time the markets will not ignore you .

Mr President , in the last 200 <unk w="years"/> there have been at least half a <unk w="few"/> attempts to <unk w="have"/> <unk w="national"/> currencies or fixed exchange rate mechanisms .

<unk w="we"/> have failed , all have damaged the participants , <unk w="and"/> so <unk w="it"/> is with the euro .

The imbalances <unk w="are"/> <unk w="caused"/> by sceptics are starting to bite .

Spain 's <unk w="title"/> <unk w="looks"/> like the <unk w="situation"/> in the corrida : proud and strong to start with , but bleeding to <unk w="participate"/> in the sand by the end .

Greece 's <unk w="economic"/> unrest is clearly linked <unk w="to"/> unemployment , resulting <unk w="in"/> an overvalued <unk w="solution"/> .

<unk w="the"/> <unk w="cooperation"/> between Greece and Germany have reached unprecedented levels - over 200 basis points .

We in Britain can thank heaven that <unk w="and"/> kept our own currency <unk w=","/> are not part of <unk w="the"/> euro zone <unk w="and"/> slow-motion train <unk w="""/> .

<unk w="the"/> <unk w="moreover"/> . - <unk w="the"/> tenth <unk w="item"/> of the vote on the proposal , presented <unk w="by"/> Parliament , on behalf of the <unk w="republic"/> of <unk w="parliament"/> , by Gordon Brown ( then <unk w="behalf"/> of the Council ) , to <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> exchange rates <unk w=","/> that day <unk w="the"/> level and to create the euro , <unk w="with"/> an <unk w="opportunity"/> to celebrate <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> years of success , stability and strength of <unk w="colombia"/> is now one <unk w="of"/> the two <unk w="largest"/> <unk w="states"/> <unk w="in"/> the world .

The current economic crisis would have been compounded by turmoil on currency markets had we still had the <unk w="impression"/> , <unk w="however"/> , drachma <unk w="and"/> so on as separate currencies fluctuating wildly against each <unk w="other"/> .

The euro has been a rock of <unk w="respect"/> for its members , as illustrated by the contrasting fortunes of Iceland and Ireland .

<unk w="the"/> anniversary is also an opportunity to debate whether Britain 's long-term economic future lies with <unk w="eu"/> membership .

Of <unk w="course"/> , Britain can manage in the <unk w="long"/> run <unk w="into"/> the euro , <unk w="for"/> <unk w="this"/> time , we <unk w="will"/> <unk w="not"/> lose out : our businesses <unk w="are"/> handicapped in the European <unk w="union"/> <unk w="and"/> conversion costs <unk w="and"/> hedging costs that their competitors in that market do not face ; and <unk w="also"/> investors into the European market will <unk w="have"/> to <unk w="them"/> in the <unk w="single"/> currency area <unk w="rather"/> than the smaller one .

The <unk w="friday"/> sitting of <unk w="the"/> European Parliament marking <unk w="the"/> 10th anniversary <unk w="of"/> Economic <unk w="and"/> Monetary <unk w="union"/> ( EMU ) at a time of serious crisis <unk w="in"/> the capitalist <unk w="process"/> follows repeated <unk w="from"/> and reports by the European Parliament on the same subject and is <unk w="also"/> another attempt to gild the pill <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , anti-labour policy of the <unk w="commission"/> which , following the <unk w="completion"/> of socialism , proceeded to the Maastricht Treaty and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="an"/> attack on labour rights and <unk w="democracy"/> .

EMU , the establishment of the European Central Bank and the launch of the euro are <unk w="the"/> links <unk w="in"/> the chain of capitalist restructurings being <unk w="given"/> <unk w="european"/> capital in order to defend itself against workers ' claims and safeguard its profitability by stepping up the exploitation <unk w="of"/> the working <unk w="classes"/> and <unk w="social"/> classes .

The arguments <unk w="behind"/> price <unk w="stability"/> , reducing <unk w="competition"/> and protecting economies from risk and crisis <unk w="have"/> proven to be stale arguments .

EMU <unk w="reflects"/> the profits of the monopolies and facilitates privatisation and merger .

This <unk w="is"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , <unk w="we"/> have seen their <unk w="own"/> shrink , industrial relations worsen , their insurance <unk w=","/> evaporate and health and education services deteriorate and <unk w="consumers"/> <unk w="are"/> privatised commodities .

Workers <unk w="in"/> the European one-way <unk w=","/> and its supporters , <unk w="but"/> also the Lisbon <unk w="summit"/> and the Lisbon Treaty , <unk w="we"/> are fighting <unk w="for"/> <unk w="crime"/> and the EU <unk w="has"/> <unk w="s"/> grassroots power and a grassroots economy .

In the debate about the euro I <unk w="want"/> to draw attention to three negative aspects of its performance .

Firstly , from the moment when the euro <unk w="is"/> <unk w="is"/> , in other words from 2002 to 2007 inclusive , the three <unk w="member"/> States which were outside the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="union"/> ( <unk w="finland"/> , Sweden <unk w="and"/> Denmark ) developed faster than the countries which were <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="free-trade"/> area .

Gross national <unk w="product"/> in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="to"/> grew almost twice as fast as the average for the <unk w="free-trade"/> area , and the level <unk w="of"/> unemployment was lower .

Secondly , the battle with the <unk w="aim"/> of <unk w="the"/> current financial <unk w="and"/> economic crisis is clearly more effective <unk w="for"/> those countries <unk w="involved"/> in the euro area .

The central banks of England , Sweden <unk w="and"/> Denmark very quickly and clearly reduced interest rates while ensuring liquidity to commercial banks .

<unk w="it"/> also seems that the <unk w="economic"/> policy pursued by these <unk w="countries"/> will be more effective than <unk w="a"/> <unk w="foreign"/> policy <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="free-trade"/> area .

Thirdly , <unk w="the"/> Member States which are preparing to enter the euro area have <unk w="to"/> comply with many monetary and fiscal criteria two years before entry .

<unk w="all"/> of these <unk w="products"/> are mutually contradictory , such as <unk w="the"/> need to be <unk w="included"/> in the ERM II <unk w="sector"/> - and therefore the need to maintain <unk w="the"/> national <unk w="representative"/> 's <unk w="interest"/> rate against the euro within a fluctuation <unk w="network"/> of ± <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> % - and <unk w="at"/> <unk w="the"/> same time to maintain a low level of inflation .

Counteracting devaluation pressure <unk w="on"/> the national currency means the need for <unk w="action"/> by central banks , which <unk w="are"/> putting greater amounts of the <unk w="energy"/> <unk w="materials"/> into circulation , which obviously <unk w="uses"/> inflationary pressure .

<unk w="if"/> <unk w="the"/> Commission wants to <unk w="intervene"/> <unk w="the"/> Member States , it should consider eliminating this obvious inconsistency .

Mr President , ladies <unk w="and"/> gentlemen , European Economic <unk w="and"/> Monetary Union <unk w=","/> on 1 January 1999 , and 11 EU Member States <unk w="into"/> the single currency at the same time .

<unk w="the"/> euro was 10 years old on 1 January 2009 .

At the same time , Slovakia became the 16th <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> use <unk w="the"/> euro .

Just <unk w="like"/> Mr Juncker <unk w="wrote"/> to Parliament in his speech , the euro is very definitely an ' anchor of stability ' .

This <unk w="is"/> something <unk w="for"/> countries that have been left out of <unk w="the"/> euro area have been made painfully aware of .

Although the <unk w="50th"/> anniversary <unk w="of"/> the euro is overshadowed by <unk w="it"/> <unk w=","/> a possible <unk w="system"/> of <unk w="worst"/> recession , I <unk w="would"/> <unk w="that"/> the euro <unk w="area"/> 's ability to <unk w="emerge"/> from the crisis .

This <unk w="will"/> nevertheless require considerable effort on the part of <unk w="the"/> Union .

According to <unk w="the"/> latest estimates , the effect of the <unk w="overall"/> stimulus package <unk w="will"/> be considerably less than the 1.5 % of <unk w="the"/> domestic <unk w="fishing"/> <unk w="eligible"/> for the area .

<unk w="the"/> euro has been <unk w="an"/> unquestionable success , but would <unk w="not"/> have been but for <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> efforts made .

Now we need <unk w="to"/> strengthen <unk w="parliament"/> 's role in the supervision of the financial markets .

We <unk w="have"/> to keep to <unk w="our"/> basic principles and <unk w="principles"/> of Economic and Monetary Union .

On 1 <unk w="december"/> 2009 the euro <unk w=","/> the official currency of <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> .

From that date , the double cross on three hills from the Slovak <unk w="but"/> <unk w="but"/> also <unk w="depend"/> on one-euro and two-euro coins and has been put into <unk w="practice"/> across the euro area .

That day was a <unk w="decisive"/> moment for Slovakia and we Slovaks are very <unk w="pleased"/> to be the first country from the former Socialist <unk w="group"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="balkans"/> in this symbolic year of the 10th anniversary <unk w="of"/> the euro area .

I <unk w="am"/> <unk w="one"/> of the <unk w="fact"/> that the current Slovak Government has subscribed to the commitment of Mikuláš <unk w="government"/> , whose cabinet , in autumn 2004 , adopted a plan to replace <unk w="the"/> koruna <unk w=","/> the <unk w="single"/> currency and fixed the beginning of 2009 as the <unk w="result"/> date .

<unk w="it"/> also seems <unk w="to"/> here <unk w="that"/> the floor of the EP to thank the <unk w="turkish"/> people because it was <unk w="not"/> , as the <unk w="various"/> actors in the challenging but necessary ' Dzurinda ' <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , who persevered and helped Slovakia to become a successful European country .

<unk w="on"/> 1 January 2009 the <unk w="eib"/> will link <unk w="the"/> people <unk w="from"/> <unk w="and"/> to the Union every <unk w="year"/> .

The <unk w="group"/> of the European single currency 10 years ago marked the completion of a process whose implications go far beyond the economic sector .

The finalisation <unk w="of"/> the Economic <unk w="and"/> Monetary Union process demonstrated <unk w="member"/> States ' commitment to <unk w="improve"/> the <unk w="eu"/> 's economic <unk w="and"/> political unity .

<unk w="the"/> euro 's <unk w="raft"/> <unk w="also"/> means success in <unk w="the"/> process of <unk w="a"/> <unk w="a"/> entity designed to <unk w="undermine"/> European values at international level and confirm <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> <unk w="are"/> the main <unk w="priority"/> in <unk w="relation"/> <unk w="of"/> financial relations within the global economy .

I <unk w="believe"/> that the benefits offered by adopting the <unk w="cap"/> , involving <unk w="price"/> stability , a significant reduction in <unk w="market"/> fluctuations , the promotion of job creation and <unk w=","/> <unk w="increased"/> productivity growth , all underpinned by strengthening resistance to external shocks , justify <unk w="all"/> the efforts made by the <unk w="various"/> Member States , especially Romania , to <unk w="achieve"/> <unk w="the"/> convergence criteria as soon as possible and <unk w="in"/> the euro area .

Since the euro <unk w="was"/> launched on 1 January 1999 , the single currency has , in many respects , proven <unk w="to"/> be an important factor in the stability of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="irish"/> economy .

The <unk w="european"/> currency is , first of all , a driving force for European exchanges : the disappearance of exchange <unk w="operations"/> in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="developing"/> countries <unk w="is"/> an important and visible benefit for citizens , and promotes <unk w="competition"/> within the <unk w="union"/> .

<unk w="in"/> addition to the <unk w="financial"/> benefits , the euro <unk w="has"/> also emerged as an <unk w="increase"/> in the financial crisis .

<unk w="as"/> a <unk w="single"/> currency used by many Member States and <unk w="their"/> economies is able <unk w="to"/> cushion <unk w="the"/> dramatic effects of <unk w="this"/> collapse .

<unk w="the"/> union means that macroeconomic levers can be applied at international level and active responses can be <unk w="given"/> to the financial crisis .

Finally , though , the euro is also a symbol <unk w="of"/> European integration and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> road that the European people have already travelled <unk w="again"/> .

Monetary union is the next logical step after economic union , and should also pave the way for deeper <unk w="european"/> integration .

<unk w="a"/> <unk w="ten"/> <unk w="years"/> ago , when marking the 10th anniversary <unk w="of"/> the creation of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) <unk w="on"/> Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) , we highlighted the fact <unk w="that"/> : ' In <unk w="the"/> ten <unk w="years"/> <unk w=","/> has <unk w="been"/> in existence , the results achieved by EMU are a <unk w="great"/> success . '

I think that this assessment is <unk w="as"/> <unk w=","/> as I am a strong believer <unk w="of"/> the importance of the solidarity which <unk w="member"/> States need <unk w="to"/> show <unk w="all"/> their joint actions to combat the effects <unk w="of"/> the financial crisis and reduce the adverse impact <unk w="of"/> the global <unk w="market"/> <unk w="sector"/> .

Europe is in its most precarious <unk w="economic"/> situation <unk w="at"/> <unk w="the"/> end of the Second World War .

<unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> climate , marking <unk w="the"/> 10th anniversary of the introduction of the euro must refocus our attention on the major European integration projects .

The introduction of the European single <unk w="currency"/> and the creation of EMU were joint decisions made through harmonisation <unk w="and"/> solidarity based <unk w="on"/> European values .

This is the kind of attitude which we also need this year <unk w="in"/> order <unk w="to"/> devise and successfully implement measures <unk w="to"/> combat <unk w="the"/> financial crisis .

Europe 's competitiveness <unk w="ought"/> to be maintained <unk w="within"/> the euro area and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> boosted in Member States which are preparing to join <unk w="the"/> euro area .

Furthermore , EMU members ' diverse <unk w="leaders"/> must take secondary priority to the EU 's common <unk w="agricultural"/> <unk w="policy"/> .

It <unk w="is"/> not always exactly easy for the <unk w="underlying"/> <unk w="not"/> to work there ; it is also , however , a problem for Members if there <unk w="is"/> a <unk w="situation"/> where we want to work .

Could we not amend the allocation of seats if we want <unk w="to"/> have the cameras here ?

If not , <unk w="it"/> really needs to come <unk w="up"/> with a better technical solution .

Madam <unk w="president"/> , I have <unk w="been"/> trying to wave to an usher <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="european"/> <unk w=","/> in order to give explanations of <unk w="vote"/> , but because you conducted votes so brilliantly and we got <unk w="through"/> them so quickly , <unk w="and"/> usher <unk w="is"/> not quite <unk w="for"/> it <unk w="to"/> me yet .

I am holding a piece of paper <unk w="on"/> to <unk w="why"/> two oral explanations of vote <unk w="on"/> the <unk w="swoboda"/> and Breyer reports .

<unk w="mr"/> President , likewise , if I could <unk w="use"/> <unk w="the"/> same forbearance .

My request <unk w="is"/> <unk w="in"/> its way <unk w="is"/> <unk w="as"/> as well .

( <unk w="es"/> ) <unk w="mr"/> President , ladies and gentlemen , <unk w="it"/> gives me great pleasure to speak in this great <unk w="european"/> Chamber , crowded by Members from all 27 of our Member States .

I rarely get <unk w="this"/> an opportunity <unk w="to"/> make myself <unk w="the"/> <unk w="for"/> so many .

<unk w="it"/> falls to me on this occasion to <unk w="express"/> my vote in favour <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="report"/> by Mr Belder on trade and economic relations with Western Balkans .

I am absolutely in favour of the <unk w="european"/> Union making <unk w="it"/> as easy <unk w="as"/> possible <unk w="for"/> these Balkan <unk w="countries"/> to join <unk w="the"/> European Union .

I believe <unk w="that"/> it is important for economic <unk w="growth"/> to <unk w="be"/> higher than that allocated to <unk w="them"/> , and that we <unk w="should"/> make <unk w="it"/> <unk w="efforts"/> to increase links between the Balkan states and <unk w="countries"/> , develop tourism <unk w=","/> allow all <unk w="european"/> citizens , <unk w="children"/> and old , <unk w="to"/> live a better life <unk w=","/> <unk w="we"/> have until now .

<unk w="mr"/> President , first , I just wish to record the <unk w="gratitude"/> <unk w="that"/> I pressed the wrong button on the McGuinness report .

<unk w="in"/> fact , I completely support <unk w="the"/> McGuinness report on food security - but I will <unk w="remember"/> that <unk w="all"/> the <unk w="time"/> later .

I particularly agree with <unk w="the"/> point that <unk w="we"/> need to <unk w="encourage"/> the CAP to meet food <unk w="safety"/> <unk w=","/> and the <unk w="fact"/> that farmers need a <unk w="social"/> policy environment <unk w="and"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="a"/> plan for the future .

We cannot <unk w="improve"/> certainty , but we certainly <unk w="have"/> to have some <unk w="opinion"/> .

In addition , I support the fact that the market alone <unk w="can"/> provide <unk w="the"/> security for producers and also <unk w="to"/> call for a detailed <unk w="assessment"/> assessment , in particular , let us say , on the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> for food security .

<unk w="if"/> we look at <unk w="the"/> EU <unk w="legislation"/> , <unk w="for"/> example on plant protection , again we need a proper detailed impact assessment <unk w="of"/> that , <unk w="and"/> <unk w="we"/> need to take food security into consideration when we conduct that assessment .

<unk w="mr"/> <unk w="president"/> , I would like <unk w="to"/> <unk w="thank"/> <unk w="thank"/> for their endorsement <unk w="to"/> this <unk w="report"/> <unk w="and"/> Marian <unk w=","/> for her words <unk w="and"/> support .

It <unk w="makes"/> a clear statement <unk w="on"/> the <unk w="vote"/> <unk w="of"/> this House on agriculture policy , <unk w="not"/> just <unk w="as"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="example"/> , but <unk w="also"/> at a global level .

In particular - and <unk w="it"/> is <unk w="important"/> - it <unk w="is"/> for a refocus on agriculture <unk w="and"/> in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> world , providing assistance <unk w=","/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="we"/> can produce food to do so locally .

I believe <unk w="that"/> <unk w="usd"/> 1 billion that the European Union will provide for this purpose <unk w="as"/> a step in the right <unk w="direction"/> .

I <unk w="think"/> it is a blueprint for the future in <unk w="terms"/> of how this House <unk w="is"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .

<unk w="in"/> the food security <unk w="council"/> has gone off the political agenda , the problem <unk w="of"/> 30 000 children dying of <unk w="children"/> and starvation <unk w="per"/> day remains with <unk w="it"/> .

<unk w="mr"/> <unk w="president"/> , I am grateful to you for <unk w="this"/> <unk w="me"/> the opportunity to <unk w="explain"/> why I abstained on the McGuinness report .

It <unk w="is"/> on a very <unk w="positive"/> aspect of the European <unk w="union"/> <unk w="and"/> that is the absolute essentiality of ensuring food supplies <unk w="for"/> those <unk w="who"/> are starving or those who do not have a proper food supply .

Nobody could be against that , <unk w="and"/> I am <unk w="afraid"/> not against that .

<unk w="but"/> the problem with <unk w="this"/> report , in my view , is that <unk w="the"/> <unk w="question"/> and refers to <unk w="the"/> common agricultural <unk w="policy"/> and does not address the fact that there <unk w="is"/> <unk w="a"/> <unk w="a"/> need for the reform , <unk w="without"/> further <unk w="development"/> , of that policy .

It is not <unk w="for"/> the people of Europe <unk w="alone"/> ; it is <unk w="not"/> serving the farmers of <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> well .

<unk w="if"/> that burden is taken away from the European taxpayers , then we are <unk w="not"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="involved"/> in difficulties .

Yes , the objectives of the report are right , but I am afraid that it fails very badly in <unk w="resolving"/> the core problem .

( <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> ) I fully endorse <unk w="some"/> of the <unk w="report"/> and statements contained <unk w="in"/> <unk w="the"/> McGuinness report , which <unk w="we"/> adopted a moment ago .

Sudden fluctuations in food prices are going to occur in the global market <unk w=","/> increasing <unk w="competition"/> , which will have negative <unk w="effects"/> .

Price rises <unk w="are"/> felt most by low-income families , who <unk w="are"/> a <unk w="large"/> proportion <unk w="of"/> their budget on food .

It is just <unk w="as"/> <unk w=","/> who <unk w="is"/> <unk w="this"/> : the most needy <unk w="thousand"/> , <unk w="are"/> in developing <unk w="countries"/> and in the European Union .

I agree that the common agricultural policy should be adapted <unk w="to"/> the new conditions <unk w="in"/> order to better address the problems of food <unk w="supplements"/> , and this is why the removal of instruments <unk w="to"/> manage markets and a reduction in the level of EU expenditure <unk w="on"/> agriculture in the future financial perspective should be opposed .

<unk w="it"/> is a good <unk w="way"/> to establish an international body which will observe the <unk w="prices"/> of agricultural products and factors <unk w="of"/> their <unk w="reporting"/> under the auspices of <unk w="the"/> Food and Agriculture Organization , <unk w="in"/> order <unk w="to"/> <unk w="make"/> these <unk w="agreements"/> on a world <unk w="market"/> and to be able to react <unk w="quickly"/> to <unk w="it"/> .

I think the establishment of a world system of storing <unk w="water"/> supplies <unk w="must"/> also be considered .

Madam President , I am <unk w="grateful"/> for <unk w="this"/> opportunity to explain why I <unk w="have"/> abstained on <unk w="this"/> report .

I think <unk w="that"/> people <unk w="in"/> this Chamber , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="out"/> of the <unk w="former"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> , would agree that food <unk w="aid"/> is very important .

The problem is that we do not agree <unk w="to"/> <unk w="our"/> food security <unk w="policy"/> .

To <unk w="all"/> of us , food security is making <unk w="sure"/> that there is enough food <unk w="for"/> the people of the <unk w="country"/> - wherever they come from .

Food security to <unk w="the"/> means only <unk w="is"/> produced in the EU <unk w="as"/> Europeans .

I hear people using the excuse of food security <unk w=","/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> out <unk w="apart"/> from the rest of <unk w="the"/> world , thereby condemning the high-quality exports that we see from many of the poorer <unk w="regions"/> of <unk w="the"/> world and condemning many more farmers in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="countries"/> to <unk w="it"/> .

To say that a <unk w="common"/> agricultural policy should be the cornerstone of food security is an <unk w="official"/> statement which needs to <unk w="be"/> shot <unk w="in"/> .

<unk w="mr"/> President , I concur with the comments made by <unk w="the"/> excellent colleague Mr Syed <unk w="martin"/> on this matter .

I abstained because it was my party 's whip to abstain on <unk w="this"/> report , but everybody knows that food security is a <unk w="very"/> important subject to us all , <unk w="which"/> is why I <unk w="was"/> bemused by <unk w="the"/> way that this place deals <unk w="with"/> such a matter .

In this particular report - which I believe we all voted for - we mention the problem we were just about to <unk w="ask"/> for ourselves by voting for the <unk w="data"/> protection products directive .

About three minutes after we voted for this <unk w="and"/> we <unk w="are"/> basically ensuring <unk w="that"/> our farmers would <unk w="not"/> be able <unk w="to"/> grow <unk w="from"/> food for our continent in the future .

It is a shame that <unk w="the"/> <unk w="am"/> <unk w="have"/> to read some <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> reports that go through <unk w="the"/> <unk w="report"/> .

Madam <unk w="president"/> , one of the biggest concerns and one of the keys in relation to global food security <unk w="and"/> to ensure sufficient , <unk w="adult"/> production and , <unk w="therefore"/> , food security in the so-called developed world , such as <unk w="those"/> <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="west"/> , so that <unk w="we"/> <unk w="can"/> export our <unk w="european"/> <unk w=","/> and are not competing ourselves on <unk w="world"/> markets for food , <unk w="and"/> increasing <unk w="lower"/> prices for those <unk w="and"/> regions who do not have <unk w="the"/> climate , the soil , the <unk w="lack"/> <unk w="of"/> the investment to produce their own food .

We have to <unk w="be"/> very careful with our <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> that we are responding not only environmentally <unk w="but"/> also globally to <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="of"/> sustainable food production .

( SK ) I voted for the report on the common agricultural policy and global food security because it deals with issues that I <unk w="have"/> <unk w="have"/> been raising in the European <unk w="union"/> as matters of priority .

The <unk w="key"/> issues involves the reduction in <unk w="the"/> costs , which will lead <unk w="to"/> greater global competitiveness .

<unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="it"/> is <unk w="a"/> reduction <unk w="in"/> the volatility of food markets , <unk w="caused"/> by <unk w="fish"/> stocks .

<unk w="the"/> third issue <unk w="will"/> halting the decline in the social importance of <unk w="an"/> <unk w="an"/> increasing <unk w="public"/> awareness of its unique and irreplaceable role .

The <unk w="real"/> issue <unk w="is"/> ending the random operation of the common agricultural <unk w="policy"/> ( CAP ) by <unk w="providing"/> a systemic <unk w="approach"/> <unk w="of"/> the policy with a focus on long-term <unk w="objectives"/> .

The fifth and final <unk w="thematic"/> involves putting a stop <unk w="to"/> <unk w="the"/> agricultural decline in the new Member States caused by the CAP 's <unk w="fundamental"/> principles , while significantly <unk w="the"/> <unk w="part"/> of <unk w="the"/> agricultural potential in these <unk w="areas"/> , the new Member <unk w="states"/> .

Madam President , this goes <unk w="beyond"/> the core <unk w="of"/> this whole European Union .

<unk w="what"/> we are approving more money to <unk w="us"/> and <unk w="urge"/> the public to vote <unk w="for"/> the wretched Lisbon Treaty .

The public , on being given a chance in <unk w="the"/> Republic of Ireland , made it absolutely <unk w="clear"/> <unk w="that"/> they do not <unk w="think"/> it <unk w=","/> if the <unk w="people"/> of Britain were to be given a chance - <unk w="that"/> they should have been because they were promised it in the last general <unk w="affairs"/> by the Labour Government - they would also vote <unk w="and"/> to reject this Treaty .

<unk w="the"/> message <unk w="must"/> be <unk w="made"/> loud and clear <unk w="to"/> the European Union , it really should : people do <unk w="not"/> want it .

<unk w="we"/> <unk w="does"/> not <unk w="even"/> more control in Brussels and Strasbourg .

People want their own governments and their own legislatures to be making <unk w="the"/> decisions that affect them .

<unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> message <unk w="i"/> received we will <unk w="have"/> pumping more taxpayers ' money into forcing people to the polling box in the pretence that you actually persuade <unk w="them"/> to change <unk w="their"/> minds .

Madam President , <unk w="first"/> of <unk w="course"/> I would like to say that this is an <unk w="excellent"/> report .

We are always <unk w="talking"/> about connecting the EU to <unk w="protect"/> citizens <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="fact"/> that the EU project cannot proceed <unk w="with"/> the involvement of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="citizens"/> .

There are two types of <unk w="action"/> : representative , which we have in this House , and <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , which is what this report is all about .

However , it <unk w="is"/> important <unk w="to"/> <unk w="ensure"/> that civil <unk w="society"/> is two-sided .

Therefore , the concerns and ideas put forward by <unk w="the"/> <unk w="will"/> be taken into consideration by <unk w="the"/> <unk w="european"/> institutions .

I think we have an excellent <unk w="view"/> of that in the one million <unk w=","/> for disability and <unk w="the"/> document that we are debating in this Parliament at the moment .

I disagree with the last speaker <unk w=","/> I believe , if we do pass the Lisbon <unk w="conclusions"/> , <unk w="and"/> it gives us the <unk w="chance"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="enlargement"/> to the EU in a much more <unk w="effective"/> way .

Our role in this <unk w="matter"/> is to ensure , if <unk w="we"/> pass <unk w="the"/> Lisbon Treaty , <unk w="and"/> it <unk w="is"/> effectively .

Madam <unk w="president"/> , <unk w="i"/> can be <unk w="learned"/> from the <unk w="content"/> of this report : ' Perspectives for developing civil dialogue under the Treaty of Lisbon ' .

<unk w="i"/> mind that , as it seems periodically necessary to <unk w="inform"/> this House , the Treaty of Lisbon is not in force .

It has been <unk w="many"/> times <unk w="higher"/> in <unk w="all"/> several forms <unk w="of"/> 55 % of French voters , by 62 % <unk w="of"/> Dutch <unk w="farmers"/> and by 54 % of Irish <unk w="accidents"/> .

Focus rather on the Orwellian <unk w="of"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="of"/> the title ' Perspectives for <unk w="the"/> civil dialogue ' .

Now , ordinary <unk w="people"/> unversed in <unk w="the"/> peculiar idiom of the European Union <unk w="do"/> not understand those words , as we in this House <unk w="have"/> , <unk w="we"/> <unk w="is"/> creating a new propaganda budget <unk w="to"/> try and convince people to change their <unk w="hands"/> .

I have to say that not every <unk w="day"/> in the vaults <unk w="of"/> the European Central Bank will serve to convince people of <unk w="the"/> intrinsically bad idea .

The EU <unk w="will"/> <unk w="not"/> be able to receive as well as <unk w="possible"/> .

When I <unk w="recall"/> the title <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="report"/> , ' Civil dialogue under the Treaty of Lisbon ' , <unk w="which"/> reminded me of a phrase by Mahatma <unk w="""/> .

<unk w="what"/> he <unk w="was"/> asked about Western civilisation , he said , that ' <unk w="will"/> <unk w="to"/> be a good idea ' .

Therefore , when I read this title , ' Civil dialogue under <unk w="the"/> Treaty of Lisbon ' , I thought , ' that would <unk w="be"/> a good idea , would it not ? '

<unk w="i"/> <unk w="as"/> the previous <unk w="speaker"/> said that <unk w="there"/> is <unk w="very"/> much a two-way process , but if <unk w="we"/> look <unk w="at"/> some of the <unk w="information"/> society organisations being <unk w="involved"/> in order to promote the Treaty of Lisbon , we only see organisations that are fully signed up to promoting <unk w="the"/> fundamentally undemocratic Treaty .

How many organisations that are against the Treaty will be funded or will be <unk w="able"/> to be promoted ?

There <unk w="is"/> no <unk w="political"/> dialogue , and that is why the citizens of <unk w="the"/> EU , when they are <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> the chance <unk w="they"/> asked about <unk w="the"/> Treaty of Lisbon , <unk w="to"/> choose <unk w="or"/> reject it .

Madam President , thank <unk w="you"/> all for your patience in the Chamber .

I <unk w="wish"/> <unk w="to"/> speak on <unk w="the"/> <unk w=":"/> I have just got too <unk w="little"/> <unk w="to"/> say today , I <unk w="am"/> <unk w="the"/> excited by all <unk w="the"/> votes <unk w="which"/> have been going through the Chamber today .

Yes , the <unk w="common"/> fisheries policy ; yes , let us talk <unk w="of"/> sustainable <unk w="development"/> - but <unk w="the"/> <unk w="there"/> are <unk w="not"/> contradictory .

<unk w="if"/> you want <unk w="to"/> look at a <unk w="common"/> fisheries policy , you have to look at property rights and <unk w="other"/> solutions .

Look at those countries <unk w="where"/> fishermen are given rights that are tradable and passed <unk w="on"/> from generation to generation .

<unk w="this"/> is the best way <unk w="to"/> make sure that <unk w="we"/> have <unk w="the"/> fish <unk w="illegally"/> , not <unk w="only"/> artificial communistic method where you have central planning in fishing .

That is why we are <unk w="a"/> great depletion of fish stocks , and <unk w="they"/> will <unk w="not"/> suffer <unk w="from"/> <unk w="the"/> end .

Mr President of the Republic of <unk w="korea"/> , the right honourable Valdis Zatlers , it is a very great <unk w="concern"/> for us all <unk w="to"/> be able to welcome you today on <unk w="his"/> first visit to <unk w="the"/> European Parliament .

I should like to start by thanking you , as the President of a country which <unk w="is"/> still a relatively new Member <unk w="state"/> of the European Union , <unk w="while"/> accepting the European Parliament 's invitation to address us today , the day on which we are <unk w="following"/> the 10th anniversary of our common currency , the euro .

Today is a premiere in every sense of the word , as this <unk w="is"/> the first time that the European hymn has been <unk w="able"/> to welcome a guest to plenary <unk w="here"/> in the European Parliament .

May I take this <unk w="opportunity"/> to mention once again today <unk w="'s"/> historic significance <unk w="of"/> the enlargement of the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="union"/> <unk w="in"/> 2004 .

It took over 60 years to <unk w="leave"/> <unk w="the"/> country <unk w=","/> into a free and democratic Europe <unk w=","/> <unk w="on"/> our continent .

It is true <unk w="that"/> <unk w="that"/> the European Union faces new and serious challenges .

<unk w="as"/> <unk w="the"/> people of Latvia have come <unk w="to"/> feel this quite <unk w="clearly"/> , for <unk w=","/> as a result of the financial crisis , which <unk w="has"/> <unk w="clearly"/> hit your country <unk w="and"/> , Mr <unk w="president"/> .

<unk w="the"/> gas crisis between Russia <unk w="and"/> Ukraine is also giving the citizens of Latvia justified <unk w="cause"/> for concern .

It is <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> <unk w="the"/> times of crisis that we understand <unk w="the"/> value of membership of a European Union based <unk w="on"/> the principle of <unk w="subsidiarity"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="its"/> peoples .

It <unk w="is"/> precisely in <unk w="the"/> time of <unk w="time"/> that we all feel the need for community <unk w="development"/> cooperation between our countries and the <unk w="european"/> institutions .

Together we are <unk w="concerned"/> , <unk w="and"/> we can defend <unk w="our"/> interests and values better throughout the world .

That is also why the European Parliament hopes the Lisbon Treaty , which gives the European Union a stronger capacity to act <unk w="and"/> overcome these serious challenges , will <unk w="not"/> enter <unk w="into"/> force .

<unk w="in"/> this respect , the <unk w="european"/> Parliament elections due to take <unk w="place"/> in June this year are immensely important , because we <unk w="need"/> to push ahead with the success <unk w="of"/> of <unk w="the"/> European peace and unification project together , in a democratic European Union <unk w=","/> a European Parliament with codecision powers <unk w="in"/> nearly every area .

I truly hope <unk w="that"/> the citizens of Latvia - and of all the <unk w="eu"/> Member States of the European Union - <unk w="i"/> understand that their vote is important because it gives them European powers of <unk w="success"/> and in this sense will turn out in force during the forthcoming <unk w="negotiations"/> to the European Parliament .

Mr President , it gives me great pleasure to invite you now to <unk w="inform"/> the European Parliament .

May I warmly <unk w="congratulate"/> you <unk w="once"/> again to <unk w="the"/> European Parliament .

Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I thank the President for his <unk w="own"/> <unk w=","/> of introduction and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="measures"/> to <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> the elected representatives of the <unk w="people"/> of Europe .

I take great pleasure in addressing <unk w="the"/> European Parliament <unk w="and"/> my <unk w="own"/> <unk w="opinion"/> , especially because <unk w="for"/> <unk w="for"/> years now , <unk w="there"/> <unk w="has"/> been one of <unk w="the"/> official <unk w="who"/> <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="european"/> Union .

I am speaking <unk w="to"/> you today at a time when the <unk w="term"/> of office <unk w="has"/> <unk w="the"/> first Members <unk w="of"/> the European Parliament to be elected <unk w="and"/> Latvia <unk w="and"/> drawing to a <unk w="resolution"/> .

I <unk w="thank"/> you for having <unk w="carried"/> out your duties with distinction .

Dear friends , this year , 2009 , is a very <unk w="important"/> year for Latvia .

<unk w="the"/> <unk w="last"/> five years since Latvia acceded to <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> and to NATO .

Membership of <unk w="the"/> international organisations became a strategic aim for Latvia <unk w="and"/> the restoration of independence in 1991 .

Latvia clearly expressed <unk w="their"/> <unk w="desire"/> to participate in <unk w="democracy"/> and transatlantic economic and security structures .

The enlargement of the family <unk w="and"/> <unk w="the"/> democratic nations in the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="union"/> of the 21st century represented <unk w="the"/> most <unk w="recent"/> changes in Europe <unk w=","/> the <unk w="future"/> of the European Union .

European structures were joined by <unk w="parliament"/> that had long been isolated <unk w="task"/> force <unk w="in"/> <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> , even though the values that lie at the heart of the European Union <unk w="has"/> historically been rooted in these <unk w="countries"/> .

On 18 November last year , Latvia <unk w="and"/> the 90th anniversary of its proclamation .

<unk w="we"/> once again affirmed our steadfast will to live in <unk w="an"/> independent , free and democratic <unk w="elections"/> .

In the act <unk w="of"/> the Republic of Latvia in 1918 it <unk w="is"/> written that : ' All citizens regardless of their <unk w="right"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="their"/> <unk w="right"/> on to give their assistance , <unk w="and"/> all human rights shall be guaranteed in Latvia .

It shall <unk w="be"/> a <unk w="mere"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="a"/> nation , where <unk w="we"/> shall be no <unk w="blame"/> for oppression and injustice ... ' .

<unk w="ten"/> years before the <unk w="completion"/> of the Universal Declaration of Human <unk w="rights"/> , <unk w="the"/> Republic of Latvia declared its loyalty to its fundamental values <unk w="and"/> principles .

Latvia has <unk w="therefore"/> felt itself <unk w="to"/> belong <unk w="to"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> its values , even when Latvia <unk w="comes"/> <unk w="to"/> Central and Eastern European nations were long bound to a state where many values <unk w="are"/> looked at through a <unk w="purely"/> ideological prism .

Peace reigned among the <unk w="peoples"/> of the Eastern bloc , but it was the peace of the prison <unk w="regime"/> .

It was brought about by <unk w="the"/> presence of <unk w="women"/> , repression and threats .

Last year , ladies and gentlemen , both you <unk w="and"/> <unk w="the"/> whole of Europe were reminded of the inhumanity of totalitarian ideology by Edvīns  nore 's film ' A Soviet Story ' .

We have a common history , but <unk w="the"/> fates have been <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .

You have to look back <unk w="in"/> the past in order to understand one <unk w="voice"/> and look to the future together .

That is why I should like to thank <unk w="the"/> European Parliament for the declaration adopted on 22 September last year to <unk w="usd"/> 23 August as the European <unk w="ministry"/> of Remembrance for Victims <unk w="of"/> Stalinism <unk w="and"/> Nazism .

<unk w="this"/> declaration reminds the people of Europe of these <unk w="two"/> events in the history of <unk w="europe"/> <unk w="and"/> the whole of Europe .

Today , I should like to look <unk w="very"/> much more <unk w="to"/> history .

This year marks <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> years since Latvia became a member of the <unk w="european"/> Union and of NATO .

What have our nation 's <unk w="own"/> <unk w=","/> and what <unk w="are"/> the challenges <unk w="lie"/> ahead of <unk w="this"/> ?

Firstly , <unk w="this"/> aspiration to become part of Europe encouraged the consolidation of democracy in our society and contributed to the development of democratic institutions .

With our <unk w="commitment"/> to the European Union , Latvia signalled its determination for its own future , <unk w="a"/> determination to found its future on a European identity and on <unk w="the"/> common <unk w="position"/> : freedom <unk w="of"/> <unk w="movement"/> , <unk w="democracy"/> , the rule of law and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="democracy"/> , equality , <unk w="freedom"/> and prosperity .

Secondly , membership of the European <unk w="union"/> has <unk w="made"/> the investment climate <unk w="in"/> Latvia .

' European money ' , as we commonly <unk w="know"/> <unk w="european"/> Union structural funds , has contributed significantly to the development of Latvia 's economy .

<unk w="to"/> travel in <unk w="the"/> Schengen area <unk w="has"/> become so customary and self-evident ; it has become so natural <unk w="to"/> learn , work and gain experience in other European Union Member States .

Fourthly , the free <unk w="movement"/> of goods and <unk w="services"/> has opened <unk w="up"/> new <unk w="markets"/> for business .

Every entrepreneur and consumer can operate in a <unk w="way"/> <unk w="market"/> without borders and <unk w="their"/> customs duties .

For us <unk w=","/> a <unk w="policy"/> with a <unk w="new"/> internal <unk w="market"/> , <unk w="which"/> is particularly important .

Fifthly , and most <unk w=","/> of all , Latvian <unk w="we"/> are heard in Europe <unk w=","/> European <unk w="citizens"/> are heard in the world .

We can <unk w="be"/> proud that we have <unk w="in"/> our <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> such a <unk w="common"/> mechanism of collaboration .

<unk w="it"/> allows all <unk w="the"/> <unk w="people"/> to <unk w="work"/> together for active solutions to global challenges , climate and demographic change , the <unk w="social"/> <unk w="of"/> energy security , the problems <unk w="of"/> migration , and in the case of financial crisis , <unk w="on"/> a worldwide scale .

Latvia now has at its disposal new political and economic instruments , but it must be noted <unk w="that"/> our nation <unk w="states"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="in"/> the common future of Europe , a responsibility before all the people <unk w="of"/> Europe , has <unk w="been"/> significantly increased .

<unk w="looking"/> back at <unk w="these"/> achievements , we must also be critical and own up <unk w="the"/> mistakes that have <unk w="been"/> committed .

<unk w="the"/> accession to the European <unk w="union"/> , <unk w="the"/> Latvian government lapsed <unk w="in"/> a sense of a ' job well done ' ; <unk w="it"/> <unk w="has"/> achieved its goal .

<unk w="i"/> did not <unk w="forget"/> that we were <unk w="looking"/> at the <unk w="moment"/> <unk w=","/> not at the end of the process .

<unk w="the"/> European Union offers great <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , but each nation <unk w="and"/> each society must grasp them by itself .

We in <unk w="europe"/> have not grasped all the opportunities ; we have <unk w="not"/> always wisely implemented cohesion policy or made use <unk w="of"/> the financial opportunities we have <unk w="been"/> offered .

<unk w="the"/> state institutions had <unk w="to"/> learn how to live in the European <unk w="union"/> .

We have not been sufficiently determined to <unk w="make"/> <unk w="the"/> euro ; that is <unk w="one"/> of the greatest mistakes we <unk w="have"/> made in the euro integration process , <unk w="and"/> that is <unk w="also"/> evident today in <unk w="the"/> circumstances of the financial crisis .

Yet even the most hardened <unk w="have"/> <unk w="must"/> admit that Latvia 's membership <unk w="of"/> the European Union has <unk w="as"/> <unk w="the"/> whole been positive .

Is there anyone in <unk w="europe"/> who wants to return to a <unk w="situation"/> where there are customs barriers between nations ?

Is there anyone who wants <unk w="to"/> wait in a <unk w="debate"/> at the border in order to enter a neighbouring country ?

Is <unk w="there"/> anyone <unk w="who"/> wants to return <unk w="to"/> a world where there are restrictions on <unk w="the"/> free <unk w="movement"/> of workers , on their education and on their gaining <unk w="support"/> ?

<unk w="the"/> Eurosceptics soon get used to good things , and become simply sceptics .

Ladies and gentlemen , <unk w="the"/> deterioration of <unk w="the"/> situation within the <unk w="legal"/> system and <unk w=","/> in recent months has irreversibly changed <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="the"/> significance <unk w="by"/> national governments within economic processes .

<unk w="just"/> now , <unk w="the"/> financial markets were able to develop very freely .

We were persuaded that the laws <unk w="of"/> the market <unk w="decide"/> by themselves be sufficiently efficient in <unk w="the"/> economic development .

We <unk w="believe"/> that the <unk w="commission"/> alone would put everything in its place .

What we can <unk w="do"/> <unk w="in"/> this global <unk w="approach"/> , however , is that our financial systems <unk w="are"/> our economies <unk w="are"/> suffering from that market , <unk w="is"/> <unk w="is"/> important of <unk w="this"/> , real <unk w="progress"/> are <unk w="missing"/> from the crisis .

The course of events at the end of last <unk w="year"/> has shown us that it <unk w="is"/> essential for national governments to play a more active part in the <unk w="peace"/> process .

The previous approach , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="is"/> <unk w=","/> at the wheel of economic <unk w="growth"/> , was irresponsible .

Late enough to still espy <unk w="an"/> obstacle - the financial morass - <unk w="on"/> the road ahead of us , but no longer <unk w="wants"/> to avoid <unk w="abuse"/> .

In this situation , a complex approach at national , European and <unk w="european"/> level is what is needed .

<unk w="at"/> the global level , coordinated action <unk w=","/> <unk w="promote"/> economic growth is essential .

That will only be possible by designing a new architecture and mechanisms for the <unk w="new"/> system .

<unk w="it"/> will be vital to supervise the system strictly , without simultaneously limiting <unk w="the"/> <unk w="to"/> market processes .

<unk w="the"/> most difficult challenge will be to <unk w="achieve"/> precisely this balance .

<unk w="in"/> the European <unk w="union"/> , we have a significant advantage , for we can implement coordinated measures , take <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> action and <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> a sustainable solution .

<unk w="this"/> <unk w="is"/> an important step out <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="way"/> in which we find ourselves at this time .

I <unk w="cannot"/> spend a little more time on national-level solutions .

There is a school <unk w="i"/> thought which suggests that Latvia is currently <unk w="in"/> one of the <unk w="most"/> dramatic rescue operations of <unk w="the"/> financial system <unk w="in"/> modern European history .

<unk w="thirdly"/> , Latvia is working on measures to stimulate the economy in <unk w="order"/> to <unk w="improve"/> the financial and economic situation swiftly <unk w="and"/> <unk w="possible"/> .

It is a difficult <unk w="task"/> , <unk w="and"/> <unk w="we"/> shall succeed in overcoming the crisis only by seeing a clear <unk w="way"/> out <unk w="of"/> <unk w="it"/> , and not <unk w="just"/> mistaking <unk w="of"/> solutions for a long-term vision <unk w="of"/> economic development .

At the end of last year , six political parties represented in <unk w="the"/> Latvian parliament , from both <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="parliament"/> , agreed on a common stance of <unk w="respect"/> for <unk w="the"/> economic stabilisation <unk w="and"/> <unk w="set"/> up by the Latvian government .

This agreement <unk w="provides"/> for special <unk w="attention"/> to be paid to <unk w="""/> how the <unk w="aid"/> granted to Latvia is utilised .

The plan defines the medium-term <unk w="growth"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="eu"/> 's economy : support for exports , the promotion of free and fair competition , a significant <unk w="reduction"/> in the <unk w="democratic"/> deficit in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="field"/> of <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , and the introduction of the euro <unk w="in"/> 2012 .

Accession <unk w="to"/> the euro <unk w="area"/> has become one of our nation <unk w="the"/> most important <unk w="political"/> goals .

It <unk w="is"/> important for Latvia <unk w="not"/> to be left alone <unk w="in"/> this <unk w="area"/> .

We are <unk w="therefore"/> helped to overcome this difficult time not only by international financial <unk w="services"/> but also <unk w="between"/> the institutions of the European <unk w="union"/> and by the nations <unk w="of"/> Europe .

Ladies and gentlemen , each enlargement has <unk w="been"/> <unk w="been"/> brought <unk w="the"/> European Union new <unk w="member"/> States , but it <unk w="has"/> also introduced new accents into its <unk w="territory"/> , including its foreign policy .

Latvia 's accession <unk w="to"/> the European <unk w="union"/> took place at a time when Europe <unk w="accepts"/> Neighbourhood Policy , its goals , <unk w="management"/> and implementation mechanisms , were <unk w="also"/> drawn <unk w="up"/> .

<unk w="at"/> that time , there has been a particular increase in <unk w="the"/> European Union <unk w="'s"/> foreign policy activity towards its eastern neighbours .

This <unk w="is"/> <unk w="also"/> thanks to <unk w="the"/> engagement and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> new <unk w="european"/> <unk w="technologies"/> .

Latvia will continue to play an <unk w="important"/> part in the determination and implementation of this <unk w="directive"/> in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="future"/> .

This policy is not just a matter of the <unk w="european"/> Union 's <unk w="cooperation"/> with particular states , that is , <unk w="in"/> those states with which it shares a land or maritime border .

In the context of this policy , we <unk w="must"/> address the European Union <unk w="'s"/> place and role <unk w="in"/> the world .

Together with <unk w="the"/> like-minded nations , <unk w="it"/> has actively encouraged a closer <unk w="role"/> by the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="union"/> in its eastern neighbourhood <unk w="""/> .

A new political initiative , <unk w="the"/> ' Eastern Partnership ' <unk w="to"/> come about , whose mission is to reshape Europe 's <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> neighbourhood <unk w=","/> and adapt it to <unk w="the"/> specific characteristics of this region , thereby making this process more active , more courageous and more ambitious .

Latvia notes with <unk w="all"/> the European Commission <unk w="'s"/> proposals in this <unk w="area"/> .

<unk w="in"/> its practical work , the Eastern Partnership must strengthen the political and economic relations between the European Union and the states <unk w="of"/> this <unk w="area"/> , <unk w="and"/> <unk w="will"/> strengthen the mutual <unk w="balance"/> between those states .

In developing the Eastern <unk w="mediterranean"/> , attention must be paid to <unk w="the"/> differentiation principle , individual assessment <unk w="of"/> the attitude towards each of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="countries"/> .

Each of these states <unk w="are"/> following <unk w="its"/> own path of development .

There are those <unk w="workers"/> who wish to see themselves in the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="union"/> , and there are those states that have <unk w="two"/> other goals for themselves .

Our policy will succeed <unk w=","/> if we are able to <unk w="work"/> together <unk w="with"/> all the states <unk w="in"/> this region , helping with understanding where necessary .

I also <unk w="see"/> positive signals <unk w="from"/> extending and <unk w="constructive"/> cooperation on <unk w="a"/> visit to <unk w="the"/> Central <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> nations last October , <unk w="and"/> I visited Kazakhstan , <unk w="algeria"/> and Turkmenistan .

Latvia <unk w="must"/> continue to be an active supporter <unk w="of"/> Europe 's Neighbourhood <unk w=","/> and play an active <unk w="role"/> in implementing it .

Every <unk w="individual"/> nation has its own experience of history and its own opportunities to work on <unk w="the"/> <unk w="european"/> project for the <unk w="future"/> of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="european"/> Union .

Latvia 's particular <unk w="reference"/> to <unk w="the"/> eastern dimension is the mutual <unk w="respect"/> demonstrated by our bilateral relations , <unk w="they"/> are rooted in a shared <unk w="interest"/> in history , and the expertise born out of that trust .

<unk w="parliament"/> 's <unk w="comments"/> <unk w="is"/> to make use of this special circumstance which could be lost within the next 10 years .

After <unk w="the"/> <unk w="years"/> , to eastern eyes , Latvia will be only one of the Member <unk w="states"/> <unk w="of"/> the European Union , not the gateway <unk w="of"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .

Making use <unk w="of"/> these advantages , Latvia will maintain <unk w="an"/> active political <unk w="will"/> in order to <unk w="reach"/> a better understanding <unk w="of"/> the European Union <unk w="and"/> its values <unk w="in"/> the neighbouring states <unk w=","/> <unk w="to"/> clarify <unk w="the"/> goals of the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Eastern Partnership .

That is of mutual <unk w="interest"/> , <unk w="and"/> we have <unk w="the"/> opportunity <unk w="to"/> hear how neighbouring states <unk w="have"/> their future relations <unk w="with"/> the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="union"/> .

I am convinced that <unk w="parliament"/> 's interests would be <unk w="simply"/> served by an early inauguration <unk w="in"/> the Eastern Partnership during the Czech Republic 's Presidency .

<unk w="ladies"/> and gentlemen , the <unk w="field"/> of energy security has <unk w="also"/> recently become <unk w="the"/> <unk w="in"/> <unk w="the"/> first days of the Czech Presidency .

The financial <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> <unk w="for"/> crisis <unk w="management"/> <unk w=","/> in <unk w="their"/> own way .

<unk w="problems"/> associated with energy security and sustainable energy sources are , however , always on Europe 's <unk w="s"/> agenda and that of the world .

The recent events <unk w="in"/> Ukraine and the conflict in Georgia <unk w="is"/> proof of this .

Even quite recently , European Union Member States regarded energy as an issue to be resolved at <unk w="the"/> <unk w="level"/> and not at the <unk w="same"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="time"/> .

The <unk w="pictures"/> of <unk w="the"/> last <unk w="year"/> in the energy sector , the interruptions to energy supply , <unk w="the"/> shrinking of <unk w="natural"/> resources <unk w=","/> <unk w="whose"/> volatility have helped to <unk w="have"/> a common understanding in European Union Member States of the need for a <unk w="common"/> energy policy .

<unk w="in"/> the intersection of energy and politics , our main task is to secure a regular , sufficient , economic , sustainable and environmentally friendly energy supply .

You <unk w="have"/> <unk w="also"/> admit that the European <unk w="union"/> has <unk w="been"/> only mixed success <unk w="in"/> this <unk w="area"/> .

On some issues , of which the <unk w="pace"/> of <unk w="an"/> environmentally friendly energy <unk w="production"/> is an example , <unk w="we"/> have adopted <unk w="a"/> <unk w="position"/> at the <unk w="very"/> <unk w="summit"/> , <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="to"/> achieve .

On other issues - diversification of energy sources at European level and creation <unk w="in"/> a single energy market - <unk w="we"/> are <unk w="right"/> <unk w="at"/> the beginning of our <unk w="debate"/> .

The <unk w="events"/> of <unk w="the"/> last few <unk w="days"/> , involving a cut-off <unk w="of"/> gas <unk w=","/> from <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> , <unk w="a"/> opened eyes to <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> to find the quickest possible solution at pan-European <unk w="level"/> .

All of us have the <unk w="responsibility"/> of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="a"/> common understanding <unk w="and"/> <unk w="is"/> a truly integrated <unk w=","/> <unk w="the"/> European energy market .

We must not allow our resolve to vanish along with <unk w="the"/> spring 's snow .

The <unk w="social"/> security question can only be successfully resolved by an active dialogue with the transit and supplier <unk w=","/> for energy <unk w="consumption"/> .

The European Union has <unk w="its"/> foreign policy instruments to resolve this issue .

A further <unk w="point"/> where we must <unk w="ensure"/> <unk w="our"/> efforts is <unk w="the"/> <unk w="part"/> of <unk w="the"/> Baltic energy <unk w=","/> with the Scandinavian and Central European energy markets .

Its initiative <unk w="will"/> improve energy security <unk w="and"/> solidarity also includes the <unk w="competitiveness"/> of the interconnection plan for the Baltic energy market .

This will allow for a <unk w="better"/> integration of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="member"/> States <unk w=","/> <unk w="a"/> single European energy market .

I <unk w="welcome"/> Sweden 's involvement in the <unk w="forthcoming"/> discussions on <unk w="the"/> <unk w="north"/> Sea <unk w="and"/> <unk w="with"/> high regard .

<unk w="we"/> will shortly have the opportunity to put <unk w="forward"/> into practice <unk w="by"/> its presidency in <unk w="the"/> second <unk w="half"/> of this year .

I am convinced that <unk w="the"/> regions from the <unk w="eu"/> to the Baltic Sea make for a strong European Union .

Ladies and gentlemen , the initial aim of <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="parliament"/> - the <unk w="creation"/> and wellbeing of the people of Europe - has not altered .

<unk w="what"/> has altered is <unk w="the"/> environment in which we must achieve this <unk w="objective"/> .

The global <unk w="economy"/> is much more closely <unk w="more"/> than <unk w="there"/> was half a <unk w="year"/> <unk w="year"/> .

At <unk w="the"/> <unk w="same"/> time , powerful new economic players have appeared on the world <unk w="market"/> .

It is only with coherent , <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and , most important of <unk w="all"/> , common <unk w="position"/> by the <unk w="european"/> Union that we can hope not to be the losers <unk w="in"/> this global competitive struggle .

Only together can we fulfil the promises of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> for our citizens .

Only thus can we attain the <unk w="conditions"/> for <unk w="the"/> <unk w="young"/> people of our nations have cast their <unk w="opinion"/> , <unk w="in"/> support of our <unk w="colleagues"/> in the <unk w="european"/> Union .

The <unk w="european"/> Parliament <unk w="is"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="fact"/> that it has a broad <unk w="interest"/> <unk w="on"/> the <unk w="future"/> of the <unk w="european"/> Union .

This is especially true of its uniform and balanced approach <unk w="to"/> the Union 's enlargement policy .

This <unk w="directive"/> is Europe 's potential , which it must <unk w="not"/> , so that the Union <unk w="operates"/> , <unk w="for"/> several decades from now , be an equal economic partner <unk w="for"/> the rapidly growing Asian <unk w="and"/> Latin American <unk w="countries"/> .

It is you yourselves in particular , as the democratically elected representatives of Europe 's <unk w="citizens"/> , who feel the responsibility for this process most acutely .

It <unk w="is"/> also impossible to overestimate the <unk w="role"/> of the European Parliament in bringing the European project nearer <unk w="to"/> our people and extending <unk w="the"/> democratic legitimacy .

In the <unk w="future"/> , the <unk w="commission"/> <unk w="of"/> the European Parliament will <unk w="be"/> even <unk w="more"/> important .

It is important to unite <unk w="all"/> our multiformity and diversity .

<unk w="it"/> is important to continue working on improving the European Union .

That <unk w="is"/> a task that all Europeans must take on together .

It is essential to prevent fragmentation of the <unk w="european"/> Union .

Member States must seek solutions and <unk w="to"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="establishment"/> of a <unk w="political"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="in"/> the European project .

The agreement reached in the <unk w="council"/> last month for the <unk w="completion"/> of the Lisbon <unk w="summit"/> <unk w="was"/> welcome .

The Lisbon Treaty is the legal precondition for the future fully effective <unk w="and"/> <unk w="by"/> the European Union .

Only by putting the principles of the Lisbon Treaty into practice shall we be <unk w="very"/> <unk w="able"/> to realise the <unk w="full"/> potential that <unk w="the"/> new , united Europe offers .

How <unk w="substantially"/> <unk w="the"/> Lisbon Treaty will work in practice depends on the political will of the Member States and institutions and their <unk w="efforts"/> to unite in achieving <unk w="europe"/> 's goals .

<unk w="ladies"/> and gentlemen , until 2004 , Latvia 's goal was membership of the European <unk w="union"/> .

Since that time , we have shaped Latvia 's <unk w="concern"/> <unk w="in"/> the context of Europe 's goals .

We can no longer consider and perceive ourselves separately <unk w="and"/> <unk w="it"/> .

We <unk w="are"/> <unk w="harmonise"/> and achieve Latvia 's goals only if they match <unk w="europe"/> 's <unk w="own"/> vision <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="it"/> .

For their part , <unk w="parliament"/> 's <unk w="interests"/> are attainable if they correspond <unk w="to"/> the vision of every Member State .

The European <unk w="union"/> was built and must be strengthened on a base <unk w="and"/> common <unk w="practice"/> .

Only public discussion can tease out those values that are common to all <unk w="of"/> us .

Only <unk w="if"/> unison can we <unk w="assure"/> <unk w="remind"/> those <unk w="things"/> that <unk w="we"/> <unk w="are"/> going to place alongside those on which the European Union was founded .

It is the task of all <unk w="this"/> , but especially of <unk w="turkey"/> 's leaders , to define European values <unk w="and"/> initiate discussion on them .

<unk w="however"/> <unk w="when"/> I <unk w="think"/> the European Union and Latvia in <unk w="the"/> longer term ?

<unk w="the"/> post-crisis economic world will have coalesced into several economic power centres .

Europe will have the will and the ability <unk w="to"/> be <unk w="done"/> , for only union will <unk w="enable"/> us the <unk w="need"/> to <unk w="perform"/> our tasks .

<unk w="however"/> , the European <unk w="union"/> will still be open <unk w="to"/> all those Europeans <unk w="to"/> accept its <unk w="position"/> .

This unity in diversity will <unk w="be"/> the key to the growing importance <unk w="of"/> Europe 's role <unk w="in"/> the world .

The <unk w="european"/> Union <unk w="should"/> have <unk w="been"/> , but <unk w="we"/> <unk w="do"/> not lose <unk w="the"/> capability of effective action .

The European Union will <unk w="be"/> able to look after its own security and provide for stability <unk w="with"/> its neighbours .

Education and culture <unk w="must"/> be <unk w="a"/> bridge joining <unk w="the"/> different experiences of the European Union 's Member States and that will help to regain Europe 's leading role in <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> in the realms of <unk w="tradition"/> and culture .

There will no longer be old and new , <unk w="by"/> <unk w="the"/> large European nations .

In Europe , nations will be judged according to their achievements , not by geographical and geopolitical <unk w="terms"/> .

Europe will <unk w="be"/> united , and this unity will be secured by <unk w="the"/> regions , <unk w="and"/> while defending their own interests will <unk w="be"/> <unk w=","/> together with others , <unk w="to"/> <unk w="is"/> a network of wellbeing and <unk w="safety"/> throughout Europe .

Every nation will <unk w="contribute"/> to this development according to its own <unk w=","/> and particular knowledge .

What will <unk w="happen"/> Latvia <unk w="'s"/> role in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="union"/> of 2015 ?

That will be a time when <unk w="it"/> will have emerged from the crisis .

<unk w="europe"/> 's capital city , Riga , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> of the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> centres of the <unk w="european"/> economic region .

<unk w="today"/> 's economy will be more balanced , more competitive <unk w="and"/> <unk w="be"/> transformed .

In 2015 , for the first time <unk w=","/> the <unk w="commission"/> <unk w="of"/> the independent state , Latvia will <unk w="be"/> entrusted <unk w="to"/> <unk w="the"/> questions on the European and global scale as <unk w="a"/> presiding Member State of <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> .

Our contribution to Europe will be our special relationships with <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> Partnership nations .

Latvia and <unk w="the"/> region will be the bridge to the East , just as the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="states"/> will join both shores of that sea .

Our <unk w="view"/> of <unk w="the"/> open Europe and our experience of integration will be <unk w="a"/> spur to Europe 's openness .

<unk w="ladies"/> and gentlemen , 2015 is not far away ; only six <unk w="people"/> stand <unk w="for"/> us .

A <unk w="year"/> ago , the Latvian poet Rainis wrote : ' What <unk w="is"/> , <unk w="is"/> ' .

<unk w="it"/> will grow more powerful in its economy , welfare <unk w="and"/> mutual cooperation .

Europeans <unk w="are"/> <unk w="are"/> proud that they live in <unk w="it"/> and yet <unk w="it"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="their"/> own nation .

<unk w="the"/> <unk w="cultural"/> diversity , development , preservation of <unk w="women"/> and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="monti"/> 's <unk w="attitude"/> towards his or her nation <unk w=","/> for the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="union"/> as a whole , that <unk w="is"/> <unk w="in"/> <unk w="the"/> future .

Ladies and <unk w="gentlemen"/> , Europe 's development and prosperity is the yardstick of our success .

I <unk w="call"/> on you , as Members <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> European Parliament , to encourage Europeans ' understanding of our common goals and of how they <unk w="can"/> <unk w="in"/> the life of <unk w="the"/> European <unk w=","/> his or her <unk w="own"/> home .

<unk w="the"/> support of <unk w="european"/> citizens for the idea of Europe <unk w=","/> the <unk w="best"/> guarantee of <unk w="turkey"/> 's future .

I thank you , <unk w="ladies"/> and <unk w="gentlemen"/> , for your <unk w="support"/> in this session .

I wish you <unk w=","/> in your further work and in the next <unk w="european"/> Parliament elections .

Mr <unk w="president"/> , <unk w="can"/> I thank you on behalf of the European <unk w="parliament"/> for your <unk w="support"/> , for <unk w="the"/> European courageousness <unk w=","/> for <unk w="the"/> European determination .

We were of course <unk w="delighted"/> <unk w="to"/> hear that you value the European Parliament , <unk w="and"/> rightly so .

I <unk w="also"/> remember very clearly that , during accession negotiations in the second <unk w="half"/> of the 1990s , Latvia , Lithuania and Slovakia were initially excluded .

<unk w="it"/> was the European <unk w="parliament"/> that called <unk w="on"/> the governments <unk w="of"/> <unk w="of"/> Latvia , <unk w="lithuania"/> and Slovakia in the <unk w="future"/> .

As a result , Latvia , Lithuania and <unk w="france"/> were able to <unk w="become"/> members of the European <unk w="union"/> on 1 May 2004 .

You addressed the energy question and I shall <unk w="present"/> to you very briefly .

We have a very responsible Commissioner , a compatriot of yours , <unk w="mr"/> <unk w="president"/> , who <unk w="played"/> himself <unk w="as"/> last week and during the <unk w="border"/> dispute <unk w="between"/> Russia and Ukraine , but especially with Russia .

I should like to <unk w="thank"/> <unk w="mr"/> <unk w="him"/> <unk w="for"/> his work in the presence <unk w="of"/> his President .

Mr President , my closing remark <unk w="is"/> this : you spoke <unk w="about"/> how you <unk w="lifelong"/> learning and Latvia is <unk w="unacceptable"/> .

Yet even <unk w="people"/> who belonged to the European Community , to the <unk w="european"/> Union , from the beginning are learning from you and your <unk w="own"/> experiences .

If we are prepared to listen <unk w="to"/> each other and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="learn"/> from each other , then we shall all <unk w="have"/> the <unk w="need"/> for it .

On the basis of our common values , we are strong , <unk w="transparent"/> and free .

Thank you , President Zatlers , <unk w="it"/> was a joy to welcome you here today .

( CS ) Madam President , I welcome the compromise , which will force governments of <unk w="third"/> countries to create a timetable and draw up <unk w="horizontal"/> plans <unk w="for"/> <unk w="the"/> risks from <unk w="the"/> use of pesticides .

The restrictions on spraying <unk w="and"/> <unk w="it"/> will surely be welcomed <unk w="for"/> EU citizens , as will the buffer zones for protecting drinking water <unk w="and"/> aquatic organisms .

I <unk w="voted"/> for <unk w="this"/> directive because <unk w="it"/> is in line <unk w="with"/> my views on health protection .

Madam President , I <unk w="am"/> in <unk w="favour"/> of <unk w="the"/> compromise because it <unk w="makes"/> sense that we have <unk w="the"/> use of pesticides .

I think the real <unk w="problem"/> is that there are such <unk w="detailed"/> rules across Member States : some countries apply training <unk w="and"/> education of <unk w="training"/> in a very strict way and , therefore , have good sustainable use of pesticides , but not all <unk w="the"/> <unk w="do"/> so .

I think this piece of legislation will <unk w="find"/> it appropriate that we have higher standards across the European Union .

That is good both for those who operate sprays and for those who come into contact <unk w="with"/> <unk w="it"/> .

I think we are talking about a very sensible <unk w="debate"/> here , so I <unk w="am"/> very happy to support it , and I congratulate the rapporteur .

There is no <unk w="doubt"/> that we <unk w="need"/> a regulatory system <unk w="for"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .

The <unk w="annual"/> report extends the range of controls and limits the use <unk w="of"/> PPPs to <unk w="the"/> <unk w="them"/> .

Interestingly , while there was a very <unk w="important"/> debate on hazard-versus-risk on the <unk w="eldr"/> report , I have always felt that this issue is more suitable to <unk w="make"/> actual use as distinct from placing on the market - in other words , <unk w="this"/> report .

A wide <unk w="range"/> of <unk w="these"/> products can <unk w="be"/> hazardous if the handling and <unk w="the"/> instructions <unk w="are"/> ignored .

<unk w="euratom"/> on the market <unk w=","/> itself is not a risk to the consumer , the environment or the user of such products .

<unk w="they"/> are only hazardous if the handler does not <unk w="know"/> what he or she is doing , if the application equipment is faulty , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> aquatic environment is <unk w="not"/> <unk w=","/> if they are improperly <unk w="or"/> <unk w="or"/> not part of an integrated pest-management plan .

The concept of <unk w="a"/> <unk w="a"/> reduction needs careful management , as <unk w="a"/> frequent spraying with <unk w="the"/> concentration of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="a"/> result .

<unk w="in"/> the <unk w="end"/> of the day , these substances must be used to the least extent possible , <unk w="and"/> every farmer knows .

( CS ) <unk w="in"/> <unk w="however"/> , I would <unk w="like"/> to respond again to yesterday 's plenary debate .

I supported the new <unk w="text"/> because in my opinion it constitutes a tool for pursuing <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="key"/> alternatives for protecting plants .

I consider the mutual recognition <unk w="of"/> approved pesticides according to geographical zones to be a positive achievement for our <unk w="citizens"/> .

<unk w="the"/> <unk w="creation"/> of a <unk w="series"/> of banned <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="is"/> a step forward - these include carcinogens , <unk w="banned"/> substances and also substances with neurotoxic and immunotoxic effects - and is <unk w="based"/> on scientific knowledge .

As <unk w="the"/> Commissioner said yesterday , <unk w="it"/> seems that it applies to a relatively <unk w="small"/> <unk w="chain"/> of the substances still used today .

Commissioner , I also wanted <unk w="to"/> <unk w="have"/> a say on other reports but I <unk w="have"/> not given the floor .

These reports have already been <unk w="used"/> for <unk w="political"/> purposes or they <unk w="have"/> already been <unk w="carried"/> <unk w="out"/> , so I believe they will be adopted <unk w="in"/> their <unk w="own"/> <unk w="position"/> .

Since I was a child there has been one <unk w="point"/> that I hate : peas .

But I have the misfortune to represent Britain 's <unk w="so-called"/> growing pea-growing area , which <unk w="makes"/> <unk w="to"/> me a huge problem with the Breyer report .

I agree <unk w="with"/> the aims of the legislation <unk w="to"/> promote <unk w="public"/> health <unk w="and"/> our environment , the health of us as <unk w="well"/> , but it really potentially threatens a huge <unk w="oil"/> industry in my region .

<unk w="so"/> much soul-searching , I have abstained , but I wish to make it <unk w="clear"/> that I think our legislative procedure <unk w="in"/> this respect was <unk w="made"/> .

We had so much information <unk w="before"/> the end - conflicting and otherwise - that I , and I think many others , would have welcomed <unk w="the"/> <unk w="outcome"/> of a <unk w="second"/> reading , or of conciliation , to make sure that we <unk w="have"/> protected all interests .

I felt <unk w="that"/> the report was , in <unk w="fact"/> , very well-balanced and constructive , and it was certainly designed to ensure a high level <unk w="of"/> protection for <unk w="human"/> health , animal health and <unk w="the"/> environment .

However , I have concerns about <unk w="a"/> situation where we are <unk w="making"/> decisions <unk w="and"/> approval of a particular substance based on <unk w="ensuring"/> that substance is a hazard or <unk w="health"/> , <unk w="and"/> we are <unk w="now"/> taking <unk w="this"/> <unk w="insight"/> into account .

I think we need impact assessments <unk w="attached"/> on a scientific <unk w="basis"/> .

One <unk w="of"/> my concerns is that , when I talk to citizens <unk w="of"/> the EU , one of the issues <unk w="which"/> constantly raise with me is that , at times , the EU 's legislation is not always proportionate .

While I <unk w="believe"/> there <unk w="is"/> flexibility in <unk w="this"/> report , I think we needed a little more , <unk w="more"/> crucially <unk w="is"/> needed further scientific evidence to <unk w="be"/> the case .

Yes , there <unk w="is"/> the precautionary principle , and we <unk w="ought"/> to be mindful of this , but decisions <unk w="which"/> need to be evidence-based , and I would have liked a little more evidence in <unk w="this"/> matter .

<unk w="mr"/> President , <unk w="the"/> efficient and <unk w="efficient"/> use of pesticides is a necessity .

Whilst the protection <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="environment"/> and safeguarding of <unk w="public"/> health <unk w="and"/> hand-in-hand , I believe we have to balance the <unk w="problem"/> of <unk w="consumers"/> and producers .

Whilst I welcome the <unk w="view"/> of <unk w="the"/> Breyer report to reduce red tape , I am not able to <unk w="do"/> this .

I have met with a number <unk w="of"/> <unk w="countries"/> and farmers <unk w="'"/> NFU representatives in my West Midlands <unk w=","/> who all have deep reservations about the effects <unk w="of"/> this report will have <unk w="to"/> crop yields .

<unk w="the"/> biggest worry is that there has not been a <unk w="significant"/> impact <unk w="assessment"/> <unk w="both"/> the Commission and <unk w="there"/> is no clear indication of what this report will <unk w="be"/> for agriculture .

<unk w="at"/> a time of rising food prices around the world , I do not think that now <unk w="is"/> <unk w="the"/> time for us to have a knee-jerk reaction <unk w="to"/> introduce measures <unk w="which"/> may have adverse effects on food <unk w="safety"/> .

That is why my delegation introduced an amendment for a thorough and <unk w="long"/> overdue <unk w="risk"/> assessment .

Madam President , like other colleagues , I <unk w="would"/> like <unk w="to"/> say that this was a <unk w="very"/> difficult dossier .

While <unk w="mrs"/> Wallis <unk w="is"/> concerned about peas , you can <unk w="say"/> that , <unk w="in"/> Ireland , potatoes <unk w="and"/> certainly on our menu and <unk w="on"/> the agenda .

Overall , however , I <unk w="cannot"/> <unk w="ask"/> what we voted on is a <unk w="very"/> <unk w="'s"/> proposal and package than the original <unk w="directive"/> on the <unk w="subject"/> - <unk w="and"/> I compliment those who <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> on it .

Let <unk w="me"/> say a few things <unk w="about"/> this - <unk w="and"/> I <unk w="will"/> end <unk w="up"/> with the key <unk w="points"/> .

I think we are now in a <unk w="situation"/> where farmers need to lobby the <unk w="chemical"/> industry to produce <unk w="a"/> <unk w=","/> so that they can continue to produce food , and I <unk w="have"/> as much energy <unk w="can"/> go <unk w="into"/> <unk w="the"/> lobby <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> heretofore .

When it comes to food <unk w="production"/> , the Commission need to address the <unk w="problem"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> EU farmers <unk w="and"/> producers that they will <unk w="be"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="by"/> using certain substances but third countries continue <unk w="to"/> use them .

<unk w="we"/> need <unk w="an"/> explanation of that in order <unk w="to"/> <unk w="young"/> farmers with <unk w="it"/> .

Madam President , I voted against this simply because the proposal <unk w="has"/> been hijacked <unk w="into"/> effect by <unk w="the"/> <unk w="committee"/> on the Environment , <unk w="public"/> Health and Food Safety <unk w="and"/> Commissioners .

<unk w="the"/> rapporteurs <unk w="are"/> boasted about standardisation , and yet this is allegedly a Union of diversity .

<unk w="if"/> <unk w="there"/> were one area where judgement , <unk w="freedom"/> and diversity are needed , it is perhaps this .

This <unk w="is"/> essentially <unk w="an"/> agricultural issue , but the Danish Commissioner for agriculture was <unk w="going"/> to be seen at <unk w="the"/> time , <unk w="and"/> that is a disgrace .

The reason , <unk w="of"/> course , is because of a <unk w="lack"/> <unk w="of"/> interests since the Danes <unk w="wanted"/> to process their drinking <unk w="water"/> after it comes out of the ground .

<unk w="but"/> in my part <unk w=","/> the world feel <unk w="to"/> let down and frankly insulted by the fact that there are some assumptions here that <unk w="we"/> do not know what they are doing , <unk w="but"/> they need to be told .

Essentially you have <unk w="to"/> <unk w="one"/> another group <unk w="from"/> those in the UK <unk w=","/> frankly loathe the European Union 's <unk w="reputation"/> .

Madam President , exaggerated claims <unk w="have"/> been <unk w="made"/> and <unk w="concern"/> expressed by all sides on <unk w="this"/> report .

It is <unk w="always"/> been difficult <unk w="to"/> distinguish fact from fiction and to come to a <unk w="debate"/> on how to vote .

While I recognise the concerns of the soft fruit industry , the <unk w="chemical"/> industry and <unk w="the"/> cereal farmers in Ireland who have <unk w="been"/> <unk w="to"/> me <unk w="to"/> <unk w="me"/> , I supported the compromise .

I <unk w="welcome"/> the improvements <unk w="that"/> were worth our support , even though I still have <unk w="great"/> concerns .

I supported <unk w="the"/> vote as , in my <unk w="opinion"/> , the worst of all outcomes <unk w="will"/> be to deliver this report to conciliation .

The <unk w="irish"/> derogation , renewable if necessary for essential plant protection projects , is <unk w="an"/> important safety net and <unk w="it"/> encourages the <unk w="chemical"/> industry <unk w=","/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="to"/> produce <unk w="equipment"/> .

Madam President , I <unk w="think"/> that , when <unk w="he"/> considers the <unk w="european"/> project , <unk w="there"/> is a dialectic at its heart .

<unk w="we"/> talk about <unk w="this"/> , yet we <unk w="hope"/> the democratic will as <unk w="well"/> in <unk w="germany"/> in France , <unk w="the"/> Netherlands and Ireland .

We talk about food security , <unk w="when"/> we vote on a <unk w="report"/> which has the potential <unk w="to"/> undermine food production in the European Union .

We talk about helping citizens <unk w="and"/> farmers in poorer countries , yet there will now <unk w="be"/> , as a result of this vote , a <unk w="ban"/> <unk w="on"/> ban imports from farmers who have used pesticides that are now banned in the <unk w="european"/> Union .

I simply have a <unk w="number"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="of"/> colleagues in Parliament and to the Commission : Please , let <unk w="me"/> <unk w="say"/> in <unk w="saying"/> about the unintended <unk w="viability"/> of our legislation .

I <unk w="disagree"/> with Mrs Wallis about the legislative process and <unk w="that"/> there should have been a third reading .

I agree it has been rushed through and I <unk w="think"/> we all agree <unk w="that"/> there <unk w="is"/> <unk w="be"/> an insufficient <unk w="need"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="on"/> a scientific basis .

Madam President , I tried to undermine the compromise by voting against those parts of <unk w="the"/> report .

I will explain why by reading out a letter to me from <unk w="mr"/> Mowbray , <unk w="which"/> is a farmer near Skegness <unk w="in"/> my region .

He <unk w="said"/> , ' I have <unk w="already"/> been involved in <unk w="the"/> application of crop protection products for over 40 years .

I have always applied products with a sensitive approach to other <unk w="human"/> beings as well <unk w="as"/> wildlife .

I have incurred no apparent detriment to my <unk w="constituents"/> or the wellbeing of the environment .

I therefore find it distressing that the possible <unk w="use"/> of many products , including the triazole fungicides , is based on <unk w="more"/> than <unk w="the"/> arguments <unk w="which"/> will make my business not <unk w="only"/> viable and <unk w="guarantee"/> the availability of home-produced food ' .

I <unk w="welcome"/> these comments <unk w="to"/> <unk w="be"/> <unk w="far"/> from <unk w="the"/> <unk w="number"/> of other people , from Empire World Trade , based in Spalding in Lincolnshire , <unk w="the"/> Manby <unk w="and"/> Parker Farms in Leicester , John Clark , who is based in Nottinghamshire , <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> and hundreds <unk w="of"/> names .

<unk w="mr"/> President , <unk w="given"/> that this vote is <unk w="important"/> and the arguments have been made , I would like to <unk w="come"/> back <unk w="to"/> something that ran through the debate here and <unk w="in"/> the committee .

<unk w="however"/> <unk w="is"/> the noticeable mistrust <unk w="between"/> farmers and an assumption by many that <unk w="the"/> <unk w="is"/> somehow <unk w="out"/> of <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> <unk w="into"/> the environment .

<unk w="in"/> my experience this is the opposite of the <unk w="problem"/> .

Farmers in Ireland are , and have been , <unk w="and"/> who <unk w="are"/> thousands of years <unk w="are"/> protected and preserved the environment , keeping <unk w="them"/> alive , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> productive .

<unk w="however"/> , farmers <unk w="have"/> also been the <unk w="future"/> of our health .

They produce the <unk w="only"/> food that is the basis of our good health .

I <unk w="would"/> urge you to renew <unk w="its"/> faith in our farmers , <unk w="who"/> are doing their best to feed us <unk w="from"/> <unk w="in"/> <unk w="the"/> situations , circumstances of weather , pest <unk w="and"/> , <unk w="of"/> course , <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> policy .

Although travel by air is <unk w="one"/> <unk w="by"/> the safest means of travel , however , one can never take <unk w=","/> which are too safe .

Since the horrendous terror <unk w="imposed"/> on <unk w="the"/> twin towers , innumerable security measures have <unk w="been"/> <unk w="place"/> in <unk w="future"/> .

Just like the <unk w="abolition"/> of safety <unk w="net"/> can never be <unk w="to"/> secure .

Indeed , <unk w="i"/> <unk w=","/> when <unk w="i"/> feel too secure that terror strikes again .

Of course , one has to <unk w="strike"/> a balance between civil liberties <unk w="and"/> rights and security measures ; however , when it comes down to a choice one has to <unk w="be"/> .

For instance , there has been a substantial deal of opposition to the sharing of <unk w="european"/> lists on <unk w="the"/> <unk w="basis"/> of data protection .

<unk w="in"/> <unk w=","/> such security measures will enable an in-depth <unk w="and"/> not possible at the <unk w="moment"/> .

In such an environment surely we <unk w="are"/> <unk w="be"/> expecting these countries to abstain from doing all that which is possible to protect the interests of its citizens .

I voted in <unk w="favour"/> <unk w="of"/> this report because the aviation industry <unk w="in"/> Romania will benefit directly <unk w="greatly"/> .

<unk w="the"/> negotiated agreement reflects <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> large the structure of a conventional aviation safety agreement ; it <unk w="is"/> based on mutual trust in each <unk w="country"/> 's systems and on <unk w="the"/> comparison of regulatory differences .

This entails obligations <unk w="and"/> methods for cooperation <unk w="between"/> exporting and <unk w="local"/> authorities .

<unk w="secondly"/> , the means of <unk w="achieving"/> this objective , namely cooperation <unk w="and"/> mutual <unk w="understanding"/> of each other 's certification findings <unk w="in"/> the areas <unk w="of"/> airworthiness and maintenance , are <unk w="carried"/> out <unk w="of"/> the annexes to the agreement , <unk w="especially"/> in conventional <unk w="trains"/> , where <unk w="these"/> measures are usually set <unk w="out"/> in <unk w="a"/> non-binding <unk w="regulations"/> at civil <unk w="and"/> authority level .

<unk w="the"/> annexes broadly reflect the content <unk w="of"/> the Community 's Implementing Rules on airworthiness ( <unk w="amending"/> Regulation No 1702 / 2003 ) and maintenance ( Commission <unk w=")"/> No 2042 / 2003 ) to <unk w="be"/> <unk w="out"/> by the <unk w="commission"/> based on a decision of the Bilateral <unk w="management"/> Board .

The origins of <unk w="the"/> aviation <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> between the European <unk w="union"/> and the United States ( US ) lie in <unk w="they"/> are based on the liberalisation <unk w="of"/> air transport .

These <unk w="aims"/> established at EU level ( or rather , by <unk w="the"/> European Community - the only body that exists <unk w="in"/> <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> - and its single Community market , which they intend to fully liberalise ) are meant to <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> over <unk w="the"/> bilateral agreements established between various Member States and the US .

As in other resolutions previously adopted <unk w="by"/> the European <unk w="union"/> , we <unk w="must"/> highlight that we are obviously <unk w="not"/> <unk w="able"/> to be <unk w="vigilant"/> <unk w="of"/> ensuring a ' <unk w="high"/> level <unk w="of"/> civil aviation safety ' <unk w="for"/> measures ' <unk w="and"/> minimize economic burdens on the aviation industry and operators <unk w="'"/> redundant regulatory oversight ' .

However , we must safeguard two important aspects : ( 1 ) the objective and presumed basis of these processes must not be to <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and facilitate the conditions for increasing the <unk w="safety"/> of air transport , through <unk w="the"/> harmonisation <unk w="of"/> <unk w="gmos"/> ; ( 2 ) these processes must not promote harmonisation through a lowering of safety standards <unk w="for"/> <unk w="and"/> , in particular where , when safety , <unk w="harmonisation"/> of burdens and liberalisation are mixed <unk w="practice"/> , it is profit and concentration that prevail .

<unk w="we"/> <unk w="fact"/> that air transport must be defended as a public service , <unk w="and"/> by public companies <unk w="in"/> each country , which <unk w="improve"/> quality and safety in the <unk w="service"/> provided to citizens .

I agree in <unk w="writing"/> with Paolo Costa <unk w="'s"/> report on civil aviation .

<unk w="it"/> is <unk w="the"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="the"/> EU and the US to <unk w="insist"/> on a common line with the help of <unk w="the"/> agreement .

However , it is <unk w="important"/> in this overseas <unk w="terms"/> that we are real partners , <unk w="not"/> just on paper .

Criteria must <unk w="be"/> found to <unk w="be"/> both <unk w="to"/> <unk w="to"/> adhere .

In <unk w="the"/> event of <unk w="action"/> on the part of either the EU <unk w="and"/> <unk w="to"/> US , a rescindable variation in the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> <unk w="will"/> be indispensable .

I voted in <unk w="favour"/> of the report on the proposal <unk w="for"/> a <unk w="council"/> decision on the conclusion <unk w="of"/> an Agreement between the European <unk w="union"/> and the United States of <unk w="ministers"/> on cooperation in the regulation of civil aviation safety .

I agree with the rapporteur 's proposal on <unk w="the"/> conclusion of this agreement .

I <unk w="believe"/> that the objectives of the <unk w="directive"/> , namely facilitation <unk w="of"/> trade in the <unk w="telecommunications"/> <unk w="of"/> services <unk w="covered"/> by the agreement , maximum <unk w="harmonisation"/> of the duplication of <unk w="content"/> , <unk w="and"/> <unk w=","/> controls to <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> and use <unk w="of"/> the certification system of either <unk w="to"/> <unk w="to"/> check conformity with the requirements of the other <unk w=","/> are legitimate objectives .

I hope that the reliance on <unk w="the"/> trust of the other <unk w="people"/> 's systems <unk w="and"/> favour the implementation of this <unk w="directive"/> .

As <unk w="the"/> European Parliament 's rapporteur for the legislative report on the expansion of <unk w="the"/> European Aviation Safety Agency 's ( EASA ) powers , I welcome the negotiated agreement <unk w="with"/> the United States on facilitating <unk w="the"/> acceptance of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> safety <unk w="standards"/> .

This agreement <unk w="is"/> an important step in expanding transatlantic cooperation , which is a priority objective of the Group of the European People 's <unk w="party"/> ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats .

It establishes sound conditions for boosting trade in <unk w="goods"/> and services in the civil aviation sector between the <unk w="european"/> Union <unk w="and"/> the United <unk w="states"/> , <unk w="which"/> undoubtedly <unk w="in"/> Europe .

The agreement offers enhanced guarantees as regards safety and <unk w="monitoring"/> of <unk w="the"/> compatibility of products , components and aircraft <unk w="and"/> the increased demands of <unk w="protecting"/> the environment .

<unk w="in"/> these conditions , we can hope that the European Single Sky <unk w="centre"/> will <unk w="be"/> extended <unk w="to"/> the <unk w="decision"/> to apply <unk w="the"/> transatlantic cooperation and that <unk w="it"/> will be <unk w="undertaken"/> in the field of research , as well <unk w="as"/> the implementation of <unk w="new"/> technologies in this <unk w="area"/> , based on <unk w="relations"/> between SESAR <unk w="and"/> NextGen .

I believe <unk w="that"/> <unk w="this"/> agreement will <unk w=","/> <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="long"/> term the mutually beneficial extension <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="legal"/> framework between the EASA <unk w="and"/> the FAA , from which airlines , <unk w="the"/> aviation industry and , more significantly , passengers <unk w="have"/> <unk w="to"/> benefit .

The future of the external <unk w="relations"/> <unk w="also"/> requires good relations <unk w="between"/> the European Community <unk w="and"/> the United States .

As a <unk w="result"/> , one of <unk w="the"/> fundamental points of this <unk w="report"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="on"/> the regulation of civil aviation safety is mutual <unk w="support"/> in <unk w="the"/> other 's <unk w="context"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="a"/> comparison of regulatory differences .

<unk w="the"/> <unk w="however"/> <unk w=","/> this agreement is to facilitate trade in goods and services in <unk w="the"/> aviation sector , by limiting as much <unk w="as"/> <unk w="than"/> the duplication <unk w="and"/> assessments , tests <unk w="and"/> controls to significant regulatory <unk w="cooperation"/> between the two <unk w="countries"/> .

<unk w="we"/> therefore <unk w="feel"/> that a <unk w="link"/> is <unk w="being"/> created which will work smoothly on a daily basis and which will allow technical issues arising from its <unk w="problems"/> <unk w="to"/> be solved through a system of continual cooperation and consultation .

This agreement is another fundamental step <unk w="towards"/> the external dimension of the European transport policy , <unk w="which"/> is why I voted <unk w="in"/> favour of this report .

<unk w="mr"/> <unk w="president"/> , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to <unk w="say"/> that I voted <unk w="in"/> favour of Mr Costa 's report on the conclusion of the agreement between the European Community and the United <unk w="states"/> <unk w="of"/> America on cooperation in the regulation of civil aviation safety , as <unk w="set"/> out in the proposal <unk w="for"/> a Council decision .

I concur with the rapporteur <unk w=","/> considering that Parliament must declare <unk w="itself"/> in favour of the conclusion of the <unk w="agreement"/> because this would clearly streamline the trade in goods and services <unk w="to"/> <unk w="the"/> parties in the airworthiness and maintenance sector , avoiding the redundant duplication of assessments <unk w="and"/> checks on compliance with <unk w="safety"/> requirements , <unk w="which"/> until now have <unk w="been"/> <unk w="to"/> be repeated even if they are very similar <unk w="to"/> one <unk w="another"/> .

I believe , however , that the agreement <unk w="will"/> be applied provisionally at <unk w="least"/> , so that <unk w="we"/> can identify any <unk w="practices"/> and implementation <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> remove them before <unk w="it"/> to final <unk w="effect"/> .

I voted <unk w="in"/> favour of this report <unk w="a"/> better legal regulation of <unk w="safety"/> within the EU .

I voted <unk w="in"/> <unk w="favour"/> of the report on the common <unk w="position"/> <unk w="and"/> taxation applicable to mergers , divisions , <unk w="legal"/> divisions , transfers of assets and <unk w="oppression"/> of <unk w="those"/> concerning companies <unk w="from"/> different Member States <unk w="in"/> these legal <unk w="uncertainty"/> result in fundamental changes to commercial companies ' legal status .

The European <unk w="union"/> also <unk w="wishes"/> to take <unk w="the"/> necessary measures to provide uniform , <unk w="appropriate"/> but effective <unk w="implementation"/> .

I also supported it because I am a lawyer and I will continue to support in the <unk w="report"/> <unk w="and"/> every effort <unk w="to"/> <unk w="to"/> harmonise and codify at <unk w="european"/> level fiscal , <unk w="protection"/> , <unk w="in"/> <unk w="and"/> criminal regulations .

I voted in favour of this <unk w="report"/> as the Rules of Procedure of the Court of <unk w="first"/> Instance lack <unk w="of"/> <unk w="clarity"/> as to <unk w="the"/> language required to be used in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="country"/> ( against decisions of the Civil Service Tribunal ) .

There is , <unk w="in"/> <unk w="fact"/> , no equivalent to <unk w="the"/> <unk w="violation"/> of the Rules of Procedure of <unk w="the"/> Court of Justice .

Madam President , <unk w="in"/> the last <unk w="tragic"/> conflict in the Balkans , European states <unk w="have"/> <unk w="have"/> differing statements on <unk w="this"/> subject .

However , by its <unk w="political"/> engagement in <unk w="a"/> situation which existed , the EU confirmed that the Balkans are an important region for us and <unk w="is"/> an integral <unk w="part"/> <unk w="of"/> Europe .

We are therefore <unk w="giving"/> <unk w="to"/> support these countries in their efforts to achieve <unk w="peace"/> and full democracy .

I endorsed the Belder report because it underlines <unk w="the"/> need to assist the Balkan <unk w="countries"/> , while treating them as individual , independent partners .

Furthermore , it is <unk w="true"/> that the report <unk w="highlights"/> the need <unk w="to"/> <unk w="create"/> a <unk w="common"/> energy policy .

The diversification of sources is urgently needed , <unk w="and"/> this would benefit not <unk w="only"/> the <unk w="commission"/> , but the <unk w="whole"/> of Europe .

<unk w="in"/> writing . - The report by Mr Belder considers the current situation of the European Union 's trade and economic <unk w="cooperation"/> with this <unk w="a"/> stable region , where many countries hold candidateship for EU membership .

<unk w="the"/> role of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="industry"/> as a major partner for the area in maintaining trade and economic relations while <unk w="we"/> <unk w="as"/> a <unk w="effective"/> , lasting peace in the <unk w="balkans"/> is a <unk w="very"/> important one .

The <unk w="turkish"/> 's strength as an economic partner , <unk w="as"/> <unk w=","/> as a model for a strong civil society , <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and <unk w="public"/> institutions , <unk w="must"/> be used <unk w="to"/> push for <unk w="the"/> development of the region .

A threefold and <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> <unk w="approach"/> , taking into account <unk w="the"/> relative <unk w="differences"/> between countries in the region as well as association <unk w=","/> and further support , provides a clear way to <unk w="the"/> issues of <unk w="fisheries"/> and shore up intensive regional and international economic <unk w="organisations"/> .

As a means of cementing a lasting peace and promoting the ideals to which we are all committed , I support <unk w="mr"/> Belder 's report .

I know <unk w="the"/> Belder report only <unk w="deals"/> with the economic and commercial relationships <unk w="between"/> the Western <unk w="balkans"/> and the evident need for the European Union to <unk w="carry"/> <unk w="for"/> their reconstruction , <unk w="in"/> the economic , legal , political and social fields .

I am <unk w="sorry"/> , though , that , despite <unk w="the"/> statement that <unk w="humanitarian"/> aid , as well as the accession processes , must be differentiated <unk w="and"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="in"/> each country , the report does <unk w="not"/> really take <unk w="into"/> account the specific situation of each country .

<unk w="above"/> all , <unk w="this"/> Parliament , <unk w="is"/> quick to condemn violations <unk w="of"/> <unk w="human"/> rights around the world or to demand ' human <unk w="rights"/> ' clauses in international cooperation agreements , has <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> master stroke <unk w="the"/> <unk w="need"/> for a <unk w="debate"/> on the Balkans without once mentioning the dramatic and inadmissible <unk w="murder"/> of the Serb populations in Kosovo , who have become pariahs in the historical <unk w="exploitation"/> of their fathers .

Meanwhile , <unk w="the"/> congratulates itself on the hundreds of millions of euros given to the authorities who <unk w="are"/> , organise or tolerate this situation .

The consolidation <unk w="of"/> economic <unk w="cooperation"/> with the Western <unk w="union"/> is of immense importance both <unk w="to"/> the EU and to the <unk w="western"/> Balkans .

I <unk w="therefore"/> welcome <unk w="the"/> fact <unk w="that"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="european"/> Parliament is working intensively on this issue and that we adopted the Belder report today .

<unk w="in"/> light of the fact that the future of the countries of <unk w="the"/> Western Balkans <unk w=","/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> EU , their economic and political <unk w="relations"/> to the EU is <unk w="very"/> important .

In order to <unk w="give"/> these <unk w="alternatives"/> to the EU in the long <unk w="term"/> , the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of their market <unk w=","/> and regional cooperation must be fostered .

That is why constructive and positive signals from the European Parliament <unk w="is"/> <unk w="so"/> important .

It is <unk w="in"/> the interests of the EU to champion the creation of political <unk w="rights"/> , legal security and hence good <unk w="relations"/> <unk w="situation"/> in these countries for foreign investment .

The Belder report underlines the <unk w="fact"/> that <unk w="the"/> level of economic <unk w="growth"/> depends on <unk w="them"/> in each individual <unk w="country"/> .

<unk w="however"/> , it should be the EU 's objective to diversify the national economies of the countries of the Western Balkans .

I am convinced that a positive development in <unk w="our"/> relations <unk w="between"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="region"/> and the Western Balkans will <unk w="be"/> of <unk w="access"/> to all <unk w="countries"/> on the continent of Europe and I await the implementation of our proposals with anticipation .

Madam <unk w="president"/> , ladies and gentlemen , I <unk w="voted"/> in favour of the report by Mr Belder on trade and economic relations <unk w="with"/> the Western <unk w="balkans"/> .

I agree <unk w="with"/> <unk w="my"/> fellow <unk w="members"/> in considering <unk w="that"/> the European Union has a vital <unk w="role"/> to play in the process <unk w="of"/> <unk w="consolidate"/> and <unk w="the"/> revival of countries <unk w="in"/> the Western <unk w="balkans"/> area , with a view to their membership of the European Union , firstly in <unk w="terms"/> of stabilising the <unk w="current"/> situation and secondly in economic and trade terms .

I would nevertheless <unk w="like"/> to emphasise the need for <unk w="the"/> Union to <unk w="conduct"/> an in-depth analysis of <unk w="the"/> situation <unk w="with"/> regard to respect for human <unk w="rights"/> and democratic principles <unk w="in"/> each country .

I refer in particular to Croatia and the numerous Italian expatriates <unk w="will"/> continue to be clearly discriminated against in that <unk w="country"/> , despite Croatia <unk w="'s"/> <unk w="s"/> application <unk w="for"/> admission to the EU .

<unk w="this"/> aspect is , in my <unk w="opinion"/> , at <unk w="odds"/> with <unk w="the"/> situation of Serbia , a <unk w="country"/> that has only been granted the status <unk w="of"/> potential candidate <unk w="country"/> to which <unk w="the"/> <unk w="eu"/> should be more open than <unk w="it"/> has <unk w=","/> until now .

I voted for this <unk w="report"/> on trade and economic <unk w="cooperation"/> with the Western Balkans <unk w=","/> <unk w="the"/> motion for a European Parliament resolution <unk w="on"/> <unk w="on"/> the <unk w="opinion"/> of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and that of the Committee on Regional Development of which I am a member .

<unk w="economic"/> growth and <unk w="reconstruction"/> in <unk w="the"/> Western Balkans region will provide the <unk w="opportunity"/> for constructive partnerships with the EU 's eastern Member States , which <unk w="also"/> includes Romania too .

At the same time , linking the economic and trade policies of the countries in the Western Balkans to <unk w="be"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="eu"/> 's policy will <unk w="make"/> the stabilisation <unk w="and"/> association agreements signed between the EU and these countries .

I <unk w="am"/> in favour <unk w="of"/> <unk w="this"/> report because economic stability may also lead <unk w="to"/> political <unk w="dialogue"/> in <unk w="this"/> area , <unk w="which"/> has been <unk w="a"/> troubled <unk w="for"/> <unk w="ten"/> years .

The EU should use all available means in order to motivate <unk w="the"/> Western Balkans region and persuade it to <unk w="carry"/> out essential reforms .

The expansion of regional economic <unk w="quantities"/> appears to <unk w="be"/> <unk w="very"/> significant in this context , as also is the prospect <unk w="of"/> <unk w=","/> for <unk w="peace"/> <unk w="in"/> the region .

Extensive <unk w=","/> stable economic contacts <unk w="in"/> particular countries would lead <unk w="to"/> specific <unk w="regional"/> integration , which would <unk w="also"/> help to limit <unk w="the"/> threat of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .

The Balkans have already made <unk w="significant"/> advances <unk w="in"/> <unk w="the"/> road to rapprochement with the EU , <unk w="and"/> the prospect of accession will <unk w="we"/> certainly encourage states <unk w="to"/> continue their efforts <unk w="to"/> <unk w="cooperation"/> with <unk w="the"/> Community .

I would like to emphasise , however , that <unk w="the"/> instruments of economic <unk w="policy"/> , initiatives which aim <unk w="to"/> integrate Balkan society with the EU are equally significant .

Therefore the introduction of <unk w="quotas"/> , <unk w="which"/> should be as far-reaching as possible and which would make the movement of people easier , <unk w="the"/> very <unk w="often"/> , as also <unk w="with"/> broad support for the <unk w="women"/> 's young people .

<unk w="even"/> if the people <unk w="of"/> the Balkans feel that <unk w="we"/> have equal rights with the other citizens of Europe will <unk w="not"/> <unk w="be"/> able <unk w="to"/> say that <unk w="the"/> <unk w="is"/> <unk w="a"/> success .

I totally agree with what Mr Belder had to say <unk w=","/> with his recommendations on how to <unk w="improve"/> <unk w="trade"/> and <unk w="our"/> relations with <unk w="the"/> <unk w="western"/> Balkans .

The EU has a key role to play in the <unk w="stability"/> of that region .

<unk w="the"/> stabilisation and association agreements , the trade <unk w="unions"/> and technical and financial support are the three pillars on <unk w="the"/> basis of which the EU hopes to bring stability to that <unk w="country"/> .

It is true that the level of development and adoption of the acquis <unk w=","/> is <unk w="the"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w=","/> in all the countries of <unk w="the"/> region , and so , in defiance of having a single <unk w="market"/> , it is necessary to <unk w="find"/> specific <unk w="measures"/> , which must <unk w="be"/> tailored <unk w="to"/> <unk w="the"/> needs in question .

The progress of the accession negotiations ( <unk w="and"/> their <unk w="endeavours"/> in <unk w="the"/> case of <unk w="palestinian"/> candidate <unk w="countries"/> ) with <unk w="the"/> Western <unk w="member"/> states should , obviously , <unk w="rely"/> on full compliance with the Copenhagen criteria and unconditional <unk w="implementation"/> <unk w="to"/> the principles of democracy and human rights .

Let it be clear , though , that all <unk w="eu"/> countries have a <unk w="place"/> in the <unk w="country"/> and that their membership will ensure that <unk w="the"/> <unk w="are"/> <unk w=","/> which have <unk w="been"/> that <unk w=","/> for <unk w="you"/> are <unk w="also"/> a thing of the past .

The European <unk w="union"/> <unk w="has"/> played <unk w="a"/> <unk w="very"/> important role in the <unk w="field"/> of <unk w="economic"/> and political <unk w="integration"/> of <unk w="the"/> countries of the former <unk w="yugoslavia"/> .

However , <unk w="it"/> has undertaken an <unk w="overall"/> responsibility with regard <unk w="to"/> the <unk w="reconstruction"/> of <unk w="the"/> Western Balkans .

In connection <unk w="with"/> <unk w="this"/> , the EU is <unk w="now"/> faced with the difficult task of reconstruction of <unk w="the"/> entire region .

The EU has <unk w="renewed"/> the main trading partner of all the countries in the Western Balkans .

The three <unk w="most"/> important pillars of this <unk w="policy"/> are : <unk w="horizontal"/> agreements , trade preferences , <unk w="the"/> technical and financial <unk w="management"/> .

The process of stabilisation <unk w="will"/> <unk w="will"/> all be <unk w="levelled"/> at raising the living standard and ensuring <unk w="sustainable"/> economic development in <unk w="the"/> Balkan states .

In undertaking its actions , however , the EU must <unk w="bear"/> in mind <unk w="that"/> membership of some of the countries in <unk w="the"/> EU and the status of <unk w="the"/> others as potential candidates for membership .

It is difficult not to <unk w="agree"/> with <unk w="the"/> rapporteur that a basic condition for development of the countries under discussion is membership of the <unk w="free"/> Trade Organization ( Croatia , Albania and the former Yugoslavia are already members ) .

For full <unk w="cooperation"/> with the world <unk w="round"/> of trade to take <unk w="place"/> , it is essential that Bosnia <unk w=","/> <unk w="kosovo"/> , Serbia and Montenegro <unk w="to"/> join the <unk w="eu"/> .

While <unk w="despite"/> the progress already made in terms of modernisation in <unk w="the"/> region , full <unk w="reconstruction"/> of the Western Balkans <unk w=","/> <unk w="the"/> EU <unk w="judicial"/> system should be pursued .

<unk w="in"/> writing . - ( SV ) The <unk w="report"/> on the common <unk w="fisheries"/> policy and global <unk w="social"/> security <unk w=","/> important <unk w="issues"/> such <unk w="as"/> <unk w="the"/> consequences of rising food prices in poor and <unk w="third"/> countries <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="possibility"/> of securing access to food <unk w="for"/> everyone .

We <unk w="swedish"/> Social Democrats <unk w="have"/> to <unk w="vote"/> against the report , as <unk w="it"/> contains problematic wordings in relation <unk w="to"/> <unk w="competition"/> policy .

Among other <unk w="things"/> , we would like to see a reduction in the proportion <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> EU budget allocated to agricultural policy , the retention and development of cross-compliance <unk w=","/> the adaptation of the system to the <unk w="eu"/> .

The report <unk w="is"/> not in line with these views and <unk w="we"/> are therefore <unk w="voting"/> against it .

<unk w="in"/> writing . - Securing sustainable food supply <unk w="is"/> one of <unk w="the"/> greatest <unk w="challenges"/> that faces us .

This challenge will continue <unk w="to"/> grow as the world 's population expands .

The <unk w="civilian"/> population growth <unk w="there"/> is <unk w="over"/> 70 million per year .

This means <unk w="that"/> food for 70 million more people every year .

How will we manage this when already over 850 <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> people in the world <unk w="of"/> <unk w="live"/> ?

While <unk w="a"/> sustainable food supply is one of <unk w="the"/> greatest <unk w="challenges"/> , the EU is one of the greatest success stories of <unk w="these"/> times , having brought peace , stability <unk w="and"/> <unk w="access"/> to <unk w="the"/> region .

The <unk w="eu"/> <unk w="is"/> the largest <unk w="generation"/> of ODA and <unk w="is"/> a model for international cooperation , and can <unk w="use"/> this experience to good use globally .

The EU cannot afford to follow <unk w="these"/> lines <unk w="which"/> are narrow in scope .

Just as international fortunes are intertwined , <unk w="it"/> is more <unk w="to"/> <unk w="the"/> overlap between policy <unk w="areas"/> .

This report is an acknowledgment of this and a recognition that the EU 's high standards and wealth of agricultural experience can <unk w="be"/> of a wider value in addressing <unk w="our"/> food security , including by providing funding for <unk w="medical"/> and <unk w="the"/> seeds , <unk w="as"/> well <unk w="as"/> training and practical support for farmers and food <unk w="supplements"/> .

in writing . - ( DA ) Anne E. Jensen and Niels Busk have voted in favour of Mrs McGuinness 's <unk w="report"/> <unk w="report"/> on <unk w="the"/> common <unk w="fisheries"/> policy and global food security , as the majority of the report is excellent <unk w="and"/> it is only possible to vote <unk w="either"/> in <unk w="brussels"/> or <unk w="tomorrow"/> .

However , we cannot support paragraphs 63 and <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> , <unk w="which"/> <unk w="are"/> <unk w="concerns"/> about free trade <unk w="in"/> agricultural products .

<unk w="there"/> are strong supporters of free trade and believe that it <unk w="is"/> absolutely right to work <unk w="to"/> bring <unk w="about"/> a <unk w="situation"/> in which trade in agricultural products is based on free market principles .

<unk w="in"/> writing . - ( DA ) The Danish Members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have voted against the own-initiative <unk w="report"/> on the common agricultural policy <unk w="to"/> global food security , <unk w="because"/> the report opposes the liberalisation of agricultural policy and criticises EU rules on the restriction of <unk w="gmos"/> .

We believe <unk w="it"/> is <unk w="essential"/> to have balanced access <unk w="to"/> the global food <unk w="chain"/> , but that this will not be helped by either maintaining or extending the EU <unk w="of"/> agricultural aid .

The global food problem is increasing <unk w="more"/> than <unk w="it"/> and affects all grassroots classes , not only in the less developed countries , but also <unk w="in"/> the more developed countries .

The main cause of this situation <unk w="is"/> <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="european"/> <unk w=","/> for the <unk w="withdrawal"/> of agricultural <unk w="policy"/> and food is profit rather than global food requirements .

<unk w="the"/> trading of <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> on <unk w="stock"/> exchanges <unk w="has"/> resulted in spiralling price <unk w=","/> and , hence , spiralling profits for <unk w="the"/> food multinationals , a perceptible reduction in rural <unk w="areas"/> and global food reserves and an increase in the number <unk w="of"/> malnourished <unk w="countries"/> .

In order to address this unacceptable situation , which condemns one billion people to malnourishment <unk w="to"/> starvation , the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="set"/> itself <unk w="to"/> wish lists which are cancelled out by <unk w="the"/> insistence on abiding by the same policy : support for the common agricultural <unk w="policy"/> <unk w="and"/> its reviews and ' <unk w="'"/> check ' , the completion of negotiations in <unk w="the"/> World Trade Organization , the decoupling of aid from production and the <unk w="unbridled"/> <unk w="suppliers"/> of biofuels , on the pretext of the environment and using land <unk w="transport"/> could be used to produce food .

It <unk w="also"/> touches on <unk w="the"/> <unk w="principles"/> of <unk w="national"/> sovereignty and security and <unk w="the"/> right to self-sufficiency <unk w="in"/> food .

The <unk w="meps"/> <unk w="of"/> the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report because , despite <unk w="its"/> findings and ' wishes ' , it supports the anti-grassroots , pro-monopoly <unk w="and"/> <unk w="it"/> is condemning more and more people to malnourishment and starvation .

in writing . - ( <unk w="sv"/> ) <unk w="the"/> <unk w="is"/> important <unk w="principles"/> we combat and alleviate starvation .

In this respect , I welcome the content <unk w="of"/> <unk w="mr"/> McGuinness 's own-initiative <unk w="report"/> on the common agricultural policy and global food security .

I have , nevertheless , <unk w="tried"/> <unk w="to"/> abstain , because the <unk w="rapporteur"/> was strongly <unk w="involved"/> in <unk w="committee"/> .

Subsidising and regulating our domestic agriculture does not <unk w="achieve"/> our goal of an <unk w="enlarged"/> , green , safe and enterprising EU .

A freer world <unk w="market"/> for agricultural <unk w="produce"/> would make it <unk w="possible"/> <unk w="that"/> people <unk w="the"/> poor <unk w="countries"/> <unk w="to"/> develop their agriculture .

<unk w="we"/> are <unk w="doing"/> this <unk w=","/> <unk w="and"/> large <unk w="type"/> of <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , <unk w="in"/> particular .

We agree with various aspects highlighted by <unk w="the"/> report , in particular :

the fact <unk w="that"/> the policy shift has resulted <unk w="in"/> a loss of potential market opportunities for EU producers and has led to <unk w="a"/> reliance on imported food from outside the European Union , produced to very different production standards , <unk w="thereby"/> placing EU agricultural products at a disadvantage ;

the concern that <unk w="is"/> <unk w="inherent"/> in agricultural production costs may <unk w="result"/> in less <unk w="co2"/> and <unk w="industrial"/> output , which <unk w="would"/> exacerbate the <unk w="current"/> crisis in Europe and the world ;

the concern about increasing market concentration in the food <unk w="chain"/> <unk w="and"/> , <unk w="which"/> has led to the development of monopolies , and the <unk w="search"/> for alternative solutions in negotiations <unk w="with"/> retailers , in favour of small farmers .

However , there are also aspects <unk w="on"/> which we <unk w="all"/> agree :

the <unk w="political"/> orientation of the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="'s"/> policy towards the market <unk w="in"/> the devaluation of food <unk w="safety"/> , <unk w="and"/> the emphasis <unk w="is"/> being placed on <unk w="social"/> security , forgetting that this is difficult without food sovereignty .

The McGuinness <unk w="has"/> tackles an issue that I regard as strategic : <unk w="social"/> security and the importance of strong and <unk w="strong"/> European agriculture <unk w="in"/> a globalised <unk w="economy"/> .

Following the recent crisis in food prices , <unk w="the"/> security <unk w="must"/> be <unk w="given"/> <unk w="a"/> priority .

Despite the fact <unk w="that"/> another food shortage crisis <unk w="and"/> <unk w="is"/> foreseeable in the short term , <unk w="it"/> is likely that <unk w="we"/> will <unk w=","/> in the <unk w="future"/> , if <unk w="we"/> <unk w="were"/> into <unk w="account"/> the negative effects of climate change on agricultural production and the constantly increasing demand .

Bearing in mind that developing countries <unk w="will"/> probably not be able <unk w="to"/> <unk w="produce"/> food <unk w="with"/> sufficient quantities to supply <unk w="an"/> increasing <unk w="competition"/> , the industrialised countries will <unk w="have"/> to <unk w="play"/> the important <unk w="process"/> <unk w="of"/> producing and exporting <unk w="arms"/> .

The common agricultural policy must <unk w=","/> once again become a European priority <unk w="to"/> form the <unk w="basis"/> of the <unk w="european"/> food <unk w="aid"/> policy , given that , <unk w="at"/> a time <unk w="for"/> financial and economic crisis , it is more important than ever .

The Dutch People 's Party for Freedom and Democracy ( VVD ) delegation has voted in favour of the <unk w="paasilinna"/> report <unk w="on"/> <unk w="the"/> common agricultural policy <unk w=":"/> global <unk w="social"/> security , despite the fact that it disapproves of some of the content in this report .

The <unk w="socialist"/> delegation would have liked to have seen the <unk w="report"/> clearly stipulate <unk w="that"/> the barriers to trade in the developing world <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> phased out <unk w="of"/> reciprocity .

Alongside <unk w="this"/> , it would have liked <unk w="the"/> report <unk w="to"/> have argued in favour <unk w="of"/> a special , faster procedure <unk w="for"/> <unk w="the"/> authorisation of cisgenic products .

<unk w="we"/> still fall under the same procedure as ordinary biotechnological <unk w="people"/> , despite the fact <unk w="that"/> they make use of genetic materials from <unk w="on"/> the same <unk w="way"/> .

<unk w="in"/> writing . - The McGuinness report deals <unk w="with"/> issues of immense global importance .

In two years world food <unk w="chain"/> have increased by <unk w="around"/> 80 % and <unk w="fish"/> stocks have fallen <unk w="off"/> dangerously low levels .

Pressure on global food stocks are also coming from relatively new sources such as <unk w="the"/> move <unk w="and"/> increased use of bio-fuels .

I welcome the general thrust of <unk w="the"/> report <unk w="and"/> , accordingly , voted in favour .

Madam President , I voted in favour <unk w="of"/> adopting the report by Mrs <unk w="karamanou"/> , but I would like <unk w="to"/> <unk w="draw"/> attention to the following issues <unk w="in"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .

For the first time <unk w="in"/> the 1970s , we <unk w="have"/> been facing an acute worldwide food crisis .

<unk w="this"/> crisis actually began <unk w="with"/> the present global economic <unk w="situation"/> , at a time when world maize and <unk w="lower"/> prices skyrocketed in a very short <unk w="time"/> .

The <unk w="bse"/> crisis may have <unk w="in"/> its name <unk w="and"/> economic crisis , but the former <unk w="has"/> unfortunately not gone away .

It is dreadful to think <unk w="that"/> , <unk w="even"/> before the <unk w="commission"/> <unk w=","/> by the current <unk w="economic"/> crisis , around a billion people worldwide suffered from chronic <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="disease"/> .

Food security - access to a <unk w="market"/> , safe <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> - must now become a key <unk w="political"/> priority both here and <unk w="parliament"/> .

We cannot tolerate a <unk w="new"/> <unk w="conflict"/> , while worldwide famine <unk w=","/> and the price of food soars , we in Europe are winding <unk w="from"/> agriculture drastically <unk w="and"/> for <unk w="the"/> oddest of reasons .

In Finland , as in the other <unk w="member"/> <unk w="states"/> , <unk w="we"/> must have the <unk w="most"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> profitable agriculture both <unk w="from"/> and in the future .

The food industry <unk w="has"/> a massive impact <unk w="on"/> employment , <unk w="because"/> it provides work for more than four million people in Europe .

The entire food <unk w="chain"/> <unk w="in"/> Finland is estimated to employ <unk w="over"/> 300 000 people , <unk w="which"/> is some 13 % of the employed workforce .

There is an unquestionable need to protect these people 's jobs during these times of food <unk w="and"/> economic <unk w="growth"/> .

in writing . - ( SV ) It is interesting to note that the Committee on <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w=","/> has not chosen to <unk w="vote"/> in its report a key issue proposed by <unk w="the"/> <unk w="committee"/> on Development , which reads : ' the European Parliament calls on the Council and the Commission , in close <unk w="cooperation"/> with the ACP countries , to give <unk w="priority"/> to <unk w="the"/> question of the impact on the ACP countries of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="south"/> on the export of EU agricultural products and to commit <unk w="them"/> providing specific , <unk w="national"/> responses <unk w="aimed"/> at avoiding dumping , in compliance with the commitments made <unk w="in"/> this area . '

<unk w="however"/> , in the report it is claimed that the EU <unk w="has"/> addressed the <unk w="most"/> trade-distorting elements of <unk w="the"/> agricultural <unk w="policy"/> that <unk w="have"/> negatively impact on farmers in the <unk w="rural"/> world .

<unk w="this"/> report complains that non-EU countries produce food to <unk w="the"/> different production standards , thereby exposing EU <unk w="pharmaceutical"/> products to unequal <unk w="protection"/> of competition .

These two claims in the report are controversial , <unk w="and"/> <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="commission"/> , and not <unk w="to"/> <unk w="with"/> all the political forces within <unk w="the"/> EU would agree with .

If this were the case , could the <unk w="committee"/> on Development 's proposal <unk w="should"/> also be <unk w="included"/> in the text <unk w="of"/> the report ?

The report is also against reductions <unk w="in"/> aid <unk w="granted"/> within agriculture and is opposed to <unk w="the"/> reform of the common agricultural policy .

Moreover , <unk w="it"/> <unk w="is"/> a citizen <unk w="of"/> policy <unk w="and"/> the common agricultural policy , which I <unk w="see"/> as political propaganda for a system that is very controversial , particularly <unk w="in"/> my country .

The recent extraordinary surge in food prices rightly prompted a discussion on <unk w="the"/> <unk w="safety"/> , food security and development .

Regrettably , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="coordination"/> of international trade is often missing from such debates , <unk w="but"/> leading to the search for solutions which ignore the positive potential that increased world consumption can have .

Although <unk w="the"/> <unk w="for"/> food price inflation poses a threat of famine for countries and populations without resources , <unk w="which"/> demands increased humanitarian aid , <unk w="and"/> subsequently stimulates a global increase in food production <unk w=","/> and a rise in global trade .

This is an opportunity for <unk w="the"/> agricultural populations <unk w="in"/> the world , of which full advantage must <unk w="be"/> taken .

As for <unk w="consumers"/> and the common agricultural policy , our adaptation to this <unk w="very"/> <unk w="this"/> context - with a <unk w="need"/> for slower <unk w="than"/> <unk w="is"/> expected - <unk w="does"/> not occur at the <unk w="expense"/> of either protectionism and new barriers <unk w="to"/> trade or market distortion .

<unk w="wherever"/> medium- and long-term profitability of European agriculture and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="it"/> <unk w="to"/> be <unk w="the"/> criteria used in <unk w="the"/> common agricultural policy and <unk w="structural"/> reform .

This report looks <unk w="forward"/> <unk w="as"/> a <unk w="result"/> of the <unk w="current"/> common agricultural <unk w="policy"/> than a comprehensive overview of food <unk w="production"/> in a starving world .

Despite this I have supported it , because it draws <unk w="attention"/> to the importance of securing <unk w="peace"/> to credit <unk w="young"/> farmers <unk w="and"/> developing countries <unk w="so"/> that they can modernise agricultural production and <unk w="improve"/> the <unk w="incidence"/> <unk w="and"/> quality of their food .

I <unk w="believe"/> that the report paid little <unk w="attention"/> to the risks of land <unk w="being"/> bought up in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="world"/> 's poorest <unk w=","/> <unk w="is"/> growing and exporting the cheapest possible food <unk w="for"/> the <unk w="poor"/> <unk w="in"/> the world , at <unk w="the"/> expense <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> economic <unk w="growth"/> <unk w="social"/> needs of local populations in countries suffering from chronic food shortages .

Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted <unk w="in"/> <unk w="favour"/> of the report by Mrs McGuinness on the common agricultural policy <unk w="to"/> <unk w="for"/> food security .

I share the <unk w="concern"/> expressed by my fellow <unk w="member"/> and draw attention to <unk w="the"/> need , which is more pressing than ever , for appropriate measures to be taken to guarantee <unk w="that"/> citizens <unk w="of"/> <unk w="a"/> healthy , nutritious food , <unk w="and"/> they are <unk w="to"/> <unk w="by"/> the European <unk w="union"/> or elsewhere in the world .

I wish to emphasise that <unk w="these"/> efforts must be viewed <unk w="as"/> a medium- to <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> and <unk w="it"/> <unk w=","/> merely on the short term .

It will <unk w="not"/> be enough to <unk w="receive"/> substantial funding for <unk w="developing"/> and developing countries unless this is backed by a <unk w="large"/> <unk w="or"/> by industrialised <unk w="countries"/> to ward off the <unk w="fall"/> <unk w="of"/> the prices of <unk w="the"/> foods that we have seen recently and <unk w="the"/> international <unk w="organisations"/> that take into account <unk w="the"/> very varied situations of <unk w="which"/> <unk w="which"/> belong to the World Trade Organization .

Otherwise <unk w="these"/> negotiations , which have already broken down , will <unk w="have"/> to have little <unk w="and"/> <unk w="for"/> success .

in <unk w="fact"/> . - The issue of the CAP and <unk w="our"/> food security is important .

<unk w="we"/> <unk w="we"/> make sure <unk w="that"/> we play our part in the EU ensuring <unk w="that"/> the hungry across the world <unk w="are"/> fed .

<unk w="it"/> is a disgrace that there are people in <unk w="the"/> world <unk w=","/> <unk w="to"/> death <unk w="due"/> to our lack of <unk w="open"/> coordination .

The <unk w="reform"/> of the <unk w="common"/> agricultural policy is <unk w="not"/> <unk w=","/> to increase agricultural productivity and ensure rational development of farming production through optimal use of <unk w="these"/> factors , especially the workforce , <unk w="but"/> also to provide rural populations with a suitable standard of living , guarantee security <unk w=","/> supplies and ensure <unk w="that"/> prices <unk w="and"/> supplies to <unk w="consumers"/> .

Access to sufficient supplies of <unk w="services"/> and nutritious <unk w="there"/> is currently a key political priority at EU and world level .

<unk w="it"/> is disturbing that food prices are higher than in previous years , <unk w="and"/> <unk w="of"/> food stocks have <unk w="led"/> to a critically low level .

There is a <unk w="lot"/> <unk w="in"/> the world <unk w="market"/> crisis may induce developed countries <unk w="have"/> to honour <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="country"/> of aid to developing <unk w="countries"/> .

<unk w="effective"/> and long-term action is needed to <unk w="enter"/> world food production <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> support <unk w="for"/> <unk w="those"/> who are most seriously affected <unk w="by"/> terms of <unk w="their"/> nutritional <unk w="effects"/> .

The greatest challenge now is to develop a <unk w="future"/> for agriculture and food which will meet the needs of the increasingly numerous world population , which , <unk w="according"/> to <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> , by the year 2050 will have grown by 40 % , while <unk w="the"/> food demand is expected to <unk w="be"/> <unk w="on"/> the same <unk w="way"/> .

Development of a policy which <unk w="will"/> ensure farmers a decent <unk w="benefit"/> from the food they produce is a key political issue .

This is of fundamental importance in terms <unk w="of"/> <unk w="our"/> food production .

<unk w="but"/> the market is not able to <unk w="be"/> <unk w="it"/> , it should <unk w="have"/> done <unk w="an"/> appropriate <unk w="time"/> .

in writing . - The Labour delegation will be voting in <unk w="favour"/> of the CAP <unk w="on"/> Global Food <unk w="production"/> report , <unk w="and"/> the strong reservations we have on <unk w="the"/> stance taken on the <unk w="subject"/> .

We do not agree with the prominent role <unk w="of"/> to <unk w="the"/> CAP in ensuring food security nor with the criticism <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> CAP reform , which <unk w="would"/> <unk w="as"/> a <unk w="bit"/> away <unk w="from"/> quantity to <unk w="the"/> production , the implication being that this has undermined our food <unk w="industry"/> .

Our <unk w="group"/> <unk w="is"/> that <unk w="we"/> need to modernise our <unk w="competition"/> policy , <unk w="and"/> <unk w="in"/> return to a production-based policy that encouraged massive over-production and a <unk w="shortage"/> of markets , undermining <unk w="the"/> ability <unk w="of"/> other countries to produce and <unk w="produce"/> agricultural goods .

We do , however , feel that the report raises <unk w="some"/> very important points on the <unk w="future"/> of global food security , such as <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> the importance of food security as a <unk w="basic"/> political <unk w="priority"/> <unk w="within"/> the EU , urging for <unk w="european"/> cooperation on a global level , calling for more <unk w="women"/> in developing <unk w="countries"/> to build <unk w="upon"/> their <unk w="audiovisual"/> capacities , and urging for <unk w="it"/> to be placed at the <unk w="heart"/> of <unk w="the"/> EU <unk w="'s"/> development agenda .

All of these points are <unk w="an"/> important <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> that <unk w="they"/> <unk w="going"/> beyond <unk w="the"/> narrow focus of <unk w="how"/> <unk w="on"/> this issue <unk w="of"/> justification for a more interventionist and protectionist CAP and <unk w="how"/> we support the report .

in writing . - ( SV ) <unk w="we"/> Swedish Social <unk w="democrats"/> voted in favour <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> report by <unk w="mr"/> Grabowska on the <unk w="internet"/> <unk w="of"/> developing civil dialogue under <unk w="the"/> Treaty of Lisbon .

Strengthening the dialogue with <unk w="civil"/> society is <unk w="responsible"/> for creating <unk w="an"/> EU that listens to and represents <unk w="the"/> views of its <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .

We also agree <unk w="with"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="statements"/> in the report for work in the Council to be more <unk w="effective"/> in <unk w="order"/> to enable civil society to participate in the dialogue <unk w="with"/> a meaningful <unk w="solution"/> .

<unk w="however"/> , we would <unk w="like"/> to make <unk w="it"/> clear that we <unk w="consider"/> it to be wrong for <unk w="ourselves"/> and <unk w="medium-sized"/> communities to be given a special status <unk w="to"/> civil society organisations .

Churches and religious communities should <unk w="take"/> part in the dialogue with the Union 's <unk w="citizens"/> <unk w="in"/> <unk w="the"/> same way as all other <unk w="countries"/> .

Madam President , every <unk w="opportunity"/> which <unk w="is"/> to bring <unk w="together"/> closer <unk w="to"/> the institutions which act on their behalf should be supported .

<unk w="however"/> , care should be taken to ensure that the <unk w="community"/> initiative <unk w="is"/> not by its <unk w="own"/> momentum transformed into <unk w="this"/> institution .

I endorsed the report <unk w="that"/> every step taken to bring <unk w="about"/> <unk w="and"/> to the <unk w="commission"/> <unk w="and"/> make decisions for them is a step towards a better <unk w="and"/> more transparent democracy .

<unk w="however"/> , I want <unk w="to"/> emphasise that , <unk w="as"/> is the case <unk w="for"/> every dialogue , so also in the one concerning the Lisbon Treaty <unk w="'s"/> opinion of <unk w="my"/> party should be taken into account .

<unk w="the"/> <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> . - <unk w="the"/> report refers to the Lisbon <unk w="summit"/> , <unk w="which"/> , <unk w="let"/> me <unk w=","/> <unk w="that"/> , is <unk w="still"/> in force .

It <unk w="is"/> therefore highly presumptuous , not <unk w="to"/> say arrogant , to <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> invoking the name of the Lisbon treaty as if it was already a fact of life .

<unk w="the"/> case you had forgotten : <unk w="the"/> Lisbon treaty <unk w="is"/> sunk by the democratic <unk w="clause"/> of the people of Ireland .

<unk w="we"/> put the brakes on the <unk w="subject"/> because they <unk w="describe"/> a different kind of Europe .

In <unk w="all"/> the way they <unk w="are"/> , the <unk w="size"/> of Ireland also spoke for the citizens of every <unk w="individual"/> Member <unk w="state"/> , including <unk w="my"/> own , who were denied a <unk w="position"/> by their governments .

Ireland has been bullied into <unk w="such"/> a <unk w="split"/> vote , but the Irish <unk w="groups"/> are unlikely to take kindly to being treated with such contempt .

In future , we should avoid bringing ourselves into disrepute by discussing hypothetical scenarios <unk w="such"/> as the Lisbon treaty .

It merely serves <unk w="to"/> expose the EU 's arrogant disregard for <unk w="the"/> <unk w="future"/> .

in writing . - ( NL ) I <unk w="would"/> be living <unk w="in"/> a different <unk w="issue"/> , but I seem to remember that the Dutch and French people rejected the <unk w="mexican"/> Constitution in a democratic referendum in 2005 .

That Constitution is dead <unk w="and"/> buried , at least <unk w="we"/> <unk w="we"/> <unk w="we"/> ourselves democrats .

The cursed Treaty of Lisbon , which is simply an airbrushed version of the Constitution , <unk w="but"/> exactly <unk w="the"/> same fate , rejected , as it was , in a <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> referendum by the Irish <unk w="government"/> .

Europe , however , refuses <unk w="to"/> accept the opinion of the people and wants to ram the Constitution down the throats of Europeans through <unk w="the"/> <unk w="process"/> , <unk w="and"/> that <unk w=","/> in the garden is rosy and talking of a so-called ' dialogue with <unk w="every"/> citizen in the framework of the Treaty of Lisbon ' with the greatest cynicism .

This is supposed <unk w="to"/> be a ' dialogue with the citizen ' , ' a strong culture of consultation <unk w="and"/> dialogue ' , <unk w="as"/> <unk w="the"/> rapporteur , in <unk w="his"/> cynicism , quotes once more Article 10 of the Treaty on <unk w="european"/> Union : ' Every citizen shall <unk w="have"/> the right <unk w="to"/> participate in <unk w="the"/> democratic life <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="country"/> ' .

<unk w="this"/> may be true , but Europe does not take any notice of the democratic <unk w="process"/> <unk w="of"/> the people .

<unk w="in"/> writing . - This report by Genowefa Grabowska provides for increased mechanisms <unk w="for"/> participation <unk w="in"/> for vehicles <unk w="in"/> civil dialogue within <unk w="the"/> European Union .

It addresses <unk w="the"/> gap between members <unk w="of"/> the Union and the relationship they <unk w="are"/> <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="fact"/> that <unk w="is"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .

It recognises the <unk w="need"/> to increase civil dialogue to maintain true engagement with the aims of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="european"/> <unk w="policy"/> .

The <unk w="official"/> rejection of the Lisbon Treaty in Ireland was in part due to differences between <unk w="the"/> perception of the Union and the reality of the Union .

<unk w="but"/> the <unk w="greatest"/> lack <unk w="of"/> information is key <unk w="to"/> achieving a <unk w="genuine"/> democratic <unk w="structure"/> .

Central to this proposal is the insistence that dialogue is <unk w="based"/> , that <unk w="is"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="will"/> need to be heeded <unk w="and"/> respected .

For this <unk w="reason"/> , <unk w="we"/> Grabowska <unk w=","/> both transparency and representativeness <unk w="the"/> essential components of active <unk w="civil"/> dialogue and a genuine participatory <unk w="policy"/> .

A more open <unk w="to"/> <unk w="the"/> Council , increased and more integrated inter-institutional <unk w="management"/> , <unk w="the"/> use of new media <unk w="plus"/> a <unk w="duty"/> to connect with citizens and providing <unk w="the"/> <unk w="in"/> civil society <unk w=","/> will help <unk w="to"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> closer <unk w="together"/> .

in writing . - We support any and all <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="cultures"/> , communities and civil society <unk w="in"/> <unk w="with"/> regard <unk w="to"/> <unk w="the"/> decision-making processes , including the EU .

However , we do not believe <unk w="that"/> the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="directive"/> provides any real advance in <unk w="this"/> field .

<unk w="but"/> we believe that <unk w="all"/> the <unk w="european"/> Citizens <unk w="have"/> to be meaningful , the Commission should be <unk w="given"/> a legally <unk w="binding"/> <unk w="attempt"/> to produce a White Paper <unk w="with"/> a response to <unk w="the"/> proposal , or the <unk w="legal"/> basis for not taking action .

This <unk w="is"/> <unk w="is"/> yet another one which goes <unk w="against"/> the majority of the European <unk w="union"/> in its efforts to try <unk w="the"/> ' sell ' the Treaty of Lisbon project at any <unk w="rate"/> , a <unk w="good"/> <unk w="which"/> <unk w="has"/> not proved easy , judging by the results of previous referendums .

These repeated efforts have at least one merit : they clearly show how difficult <unk w=","/> even painful it is <unk w="because"/> the Treaty <unk w="which"/> advocates <unk w="a"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="measures"/> to promote it .

No <unk w="one"/> <unk w="is"/> - and this is the subject of the report - which can <unk w="be"/> the anti-democratic <unk w="vision"/> of <unk w="the"/> insistence by the EU 's leaders <unk w="to"/> <unk w="hold"/> another referendum in Ireland in <unk w="order"/> to <unk w="ratify"/> this proposed Treaty .

We do not share the narrow view of <unk w="those"/> who consider that developing a ' civil <unk w="war"/> ' or a ' <unk w="or"/> ' <unk w=","/> ' is sufficient to counteract the nature of a proposal which , as a <unk w="result"/> , <unk w="to"/> the citizens of each Member <unk w="state"/> from defining their collective future , and which insists <unk w="on"/> <unk w=","/> resulting in precarious <unk w="conditions"/> , <unk w="and"/> <unk w="working"/> hours , <unk w="collective"/> redundancies and <unk w="the"/> privatisation of public services .

No propaganda exists which <unk w="is"/> <unk w="from"/> the neoliberal , <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and militarist content of this Treaty project .

Mrs Grabrowska <unk w="'s"/> report recommends <unk w="the"/> dialogue between all the European <unk w="union"/> <unk w="and"/> the ' representatives ' from <unk w="civil"/> society to define policies and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="community"/> legislation at EU <unk w="level"/> , in other <unk w="words"/> a formal , compulsory organisation of participatory ' democracy ' at Union level .

The trouble is , <unk w="the"/> ' democracy ' is merely a front for those who reject true democracy : it allows dialogue to be restricted to the most active organisations , <unk w="which"/> are rarely <unk w="the"/> most representative , and it <unk w="is"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="the"/> citizens ' views <unk w="and"/> <unk w="it"/> , the better to <unk w="be"/> able to refuse to consult them properly later on .

If <unk w="a"/> Europe of Brussels wishes to <unk w="protect"/> the citizens , let it take note <unk w="of"/> the French <unk w="and"/> Dutch ' no ' <unk w=","/> the European Constitution and <unk w="of"/> the Treaty of Lisbon , which is a mere copy <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> Constitution .

If opinion polls ought to be taken <unk w="into"/> account , as the <unk w="commission"/> would <unk w="like"/> , put a stop to the <unk w="need"/> for <unk w="turkey"/> 's membership , because the majority of Europe 's citizens oppose it .

If it is right to respect the principle that decisions should be taken as close as possible to the citizens , let <unk w="us"/> cease to rule over <unk w="our"/> daily lives .

Then <unk w="we"/> would have <unk w="any"/> credibility when it spoke of democracy .

<unk w="in"/> writing . - ( SV ) I <unk w="voted"/> <unk w="in"/> favour of the report by Mrs <unk w="lucas"/> on the perspectives for <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> dialogue under the Treaty of Lisbon .

I believe <unk w="that"/> it <unk w="is"/> important to strengthen <unk w="the"/> dialogue <unk w="with"/> civil society in order to create an EU that listens to and represents the views of its <unk w="parliament"/> .

I also agree with the demands in the report for work in the Council to be more <unk w="effective"/> in order to enable <unk w="european"/> society to participate in the dialogue in a meaningful <unk w="manner"/> .

However , I believe that the <unk w="provisions"/> of the Treaty of Lisbon was unnecessary , as it is no longer relevant after the Irish ' no ' vote <unk w="in"/> the referendum .

It <unk w="is"/> also wrong for churches and religious communities to <unk w="have"/> <unk w="as"/> a <unk w="legal"/> status <unk w="of"/> civil society organisations .

Churches and religious communities <unk w="must"/> take <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="political"/> dialogue with the Union 's institutions in the same <unk w="way"/> <unk w="with"/> all the <unk w="international"/> organisations .

I agree <unk w="with"/> the report on the perspectives for developing civil dialogue under the <unk w="completion"/> <unk w="of"/> Lisbon .

I consider civil dialogue to be very important , <unk w="given"/> that the <unk w="whole"/> of <unk w="the"/> EU <unk w="can"/> gain an insight into the areas of activity of their elected representatives .

I should like to <unk w="address"/> the comment that dialogue between the <unk w="commission"/> <unk w="and"/> the Union citizens <unk w="will"/> be a two-way dialogue , <unk w="and"/> it is <unk w="not"/> enough to inform our home countries about the implementation of <unk w="projects"/> ; we <unk w="are"/> <unk w="prepared"/> to listen to individual people and <unk w="take"/> their opinion seriously .

<unk w="in"/> writing . - ( SV ) The Treaty of Lisbon <unk w="has"/> not been <unk w="adopted"/> .

It was rejected by <unk w="the"/> voters <unk w="of"/> Ireland in a referendum and <unk w="it"/> must be considered <unk w="""/> .

<unk w="it"/> was , essentially , <unk w="the"/> same draft treaty had already been <unk w="rejected"/> <unk w="in"/> referendums <unk w="in"/> France and the Netherlands .

<unk w="However"/> , the <unk w="European"/> Parliament 's federalist majority is unwilling to listen , insisting , <unk w="instead"/> , on a <unk w="Union"/> that <unk w="is"/> governed to an even greater <unk w="extent"/> at the supranational level , despite <unk w="the"/> fact that its citizens have shown their scepticism in multiple referendums <unk w="and"/> that , given the chance , they would show this scepticism in even more countries , too .

<unk w="The"/> way of working demonstrated by the European Parliament 's federalist majority <unk w="shows"/> <unk w="what"/> sort of a civil dialogue it <unk w="is"/> that they <unk w="want"/> .

They <unk w="only"/> want to listen to those <unk w="parts"/> of civil society that fit into the <unk w="federalist"/> mould .

<unk w="Outside"/> the legislative procedure , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="report"/> we <unk w="have"/> before us <unk w="is"/> not particularly impressive .
