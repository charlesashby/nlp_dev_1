Those I have mentioned , and many others who accompanied them , could not <unk w="be"/> imagined the rapid <unk w="implementation"/> of their political project .

The euro , then , has become the most tangible sign of <unk w="european"/> integration .

It is protecting its citizens from the most serious consequences of <unk w="the"/> economic crisis .

After 10 years , <unk w="it"/> has to be recognised that the euro is an unquestionable success .

Now , anniversaries only have value if they are bridges to the future , as we have to recognise that , despite our <unk w="differences"/> indulgence as we congratulate ourselves , the true tests for the cohesiveness and coherence of the euro <unk w="will"/> await us .

This year , 2009 , will be <unk w="an"/> extremely difficult year for the euro area economies and for European citizens and there will be many challenges facing us , both internally and externally .

Internally , euro area governments will have to act together to contain the effects of the economic crisis and <unk w=","/> in the structural bases of the economy to build a bridge to the post-crisis world .

We must not lose sight of the fact that the euro , this <unk w="career"/> screen we have built around our economies , did not <unk w="only"/> fall into our laps .

<unk w="the"/> euro area economies are better protected against negative economic developments because being part of the euro area is a mark of quality certifying that its members <unk w="have"/> a real capacity for implementing prudent macroeconomic policies and policies based on sustained growth and prosperity for its citizens .

This credibility is <unk w="the"/> foundation of the benefits of Economic and Monetary Union and we must maintain it to continue fully <unk w="respecting"/> profit from the benefits of the single currency .

There is a direct causal link <unk w="between"/> the current crisis , with its origins in the United States , and the persistence of major world imbalances .

Despite noticeable progress , the euro 's international image remains , too often , overly fragmented and national interests too often <unk w="carried"/> out over the common interest , preventing the euro area from fully assuming the political responsibility that corresponds to its economic importance and from achieving all of the economic benefits deriving from Economic and Monetary Union .

Economic and Monetary Union is , of course , an economic project , but it is , <unk w="first"/> of all , a political project .

As a <unk w="result"/> , we must take advantage of the euro 's <unk w="own"/> decade to perfect the Economic and <unk w="monetary"/> Union by strengthening its political bodies , both internally and externally .

Mr President , Prime Minister , Chairmen of the committees , ladies and gentlemen , I am sure that I am echoing the views of the vast majority of this Chamber in saying that , 10 years after its launch , I , as a European , am proud of the <unk w="value"/> of the euro .

I would like to congratulate Parliament on its initiative to commemorate the 10th anniversary of our single currency here , in this Plenary Chamber of <unk w="the"/> European Parliament in Strasbourg .

Over these 10 years , the euro <unk w="has"/> brought many benefits to all its members and continues to do so today amid a deep economic and <unk w="political"/> crisis .

<unk w="in"/> the short period of a decade , the euro has earned a well-deserved reputation for strength and stability .

The <unk w="first"/> is the second of the world 's currencies and , thanks to its <unk w="performance"/> in the <unk w="irish"/> economy , is already comparable in some respects to the dollar as an instrument of commerce and means of payment in international finance .

Above all , though , the euro <unk w="is"/> part of the daily life of nearly 330 million people in <unk w="the"/> countries of the European Union .

We all carry in our wallets this symbol of a shared European identity : because the euro , as <unk w="well"/> as being a currency , is a central element of our European project , reminding us in a tangible way of the benefits of the integration process that began over half a century <unk w="ago"/> .

The euro has given us low inflation and low interest rates , thanks to a macroeconomic framework <unk w="aimed"/> at stability .

The euro has encouraged financial integration and the development <unk w="of"/> the single market ; it has protected the members of the euro area from external <unk w="relations"/> ; and it has been and continues to be a pole of stability , not just for the European <unk w="union"/> , but also for the global economy .

However , those who think that <unk w="the"/> Economic and Monetary Union is not ready to face the consequences of this crisis are quite mistaken .

The spread of their public debt securities would be much greater than currently , and their margins for <unk w="alleviate"/> the crisis through fiscal stimuli would be narrower .

The Stability and Growth Pact , reformed in 2005 , has encouraged governments to sort out their public accounts , leading in 2007 to the lowest budget deficit <unk w="of"/> 25 <unk w="%"/> , which is now enabling them to face the crisis <unk w="in"/> a better situation .

Throughout this crisis , the actions of the European Central Bank have done nothing but reinforce the solid reputation that <unk w="we"/> had already earned in the <unk w="past"/> years of Economic and Monetary Union .

The economic situation is not as we would have hoped as we celebrate <unk w="the"/> anniversary , but events are highlighting more than ever the advantages of Economic and Monetary Union .

The European Commission and Parliament must continue working with Member <unk w="states"/> , the Eurogroup , the European Central Bank and the international community in order to place our economies on the path <unk w="to"/> the sustainable resumption of growth .

In this regard , the Commission 's recommendations in the report that we submitted a few months ago on the first 10 years of Economic and Monetary Union , which was recently debated in this Chamber , are as valid <unk w="and"/> even more valid today than they were last spring .

Mr President , I would like to conclude <unk w="by"/> paying tribute to the vision and ambition of the founding fathers of the euro , whose imagination and resolute action bequeathed to <unk w="build"/> a currency of which all Europeans can be proud .

We <unk w="will"/> certainly come a long way and perhaps this pleasant , friendly gathering does not paint the whole picture .

I would like to pay tribute to all those <unk w="who"/> mapped out this course <unk w="and"/> those who have followed it .

We can find its distant origins <unk w="to"/> the <unk w="country"/> from the Luxembourg prime minister , Pierre Werner , your predecessor , in 1970 .

It <unk w="is"/> , however , the monetary crisis in the years that followed and the currency flotation which triggered action in this area .

As long as the currency exchange rates were fixed , the monetary system did not upset our attempt <unk w="to"/> create a common market .

After the unsuccessful attempts <unk w="to"/> create a monetary snake , the strong momentum from France and Germany between 1975 and 1980 led to the meeting in Bremen , in <unk w="east"/> Germany , and the decision to create the European Monetary System and introduce the ecu , the euro 's precursor .

After a period of <unk w="time"/> activity between 1980 and 1988 , the process was given new impetus with the creation by the Council of the committee chaired by Jacques Delors , resulting in the signature of the Maastricht Treaty .

Let us salute the pioneers who have been involved in this along the way , as you yourself have recently , Mr President , as well as my friend , Chancellor <unk w=","/> Schmidt and his Secretary of State , Manfred <unk w="example"/> ; Bernard Clappier , the governor of <unk w="ireland"/> Banque de France at the time <unk w="the"/> co-author of Robert Schuman 's Declaration in <unk w="colombia"/> ; Alexandre Lamfalussy , who provided us with his great , almost unique expertise during the work of <unk w="the"/> committee on European monetary union <unk w=","/> we set up with <unk w="mr"/> Schmidt to relaunch the project ; Jacques Delors , President of the European Commission , who took over ; and , last but not least , the negotiators and <unk w="representatives"/> of the Maastricht Treaty who drafted an <unk w="initial"/> text , which has not actually been touched since then , headed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl <unk w=","/> President Fran√ßois Mitterrand , whose determination must be mentioned <unk w="in"/> particular , along with their other colleagues .

On this occasion of the 10th anniversary , being celebrated at a <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of crisis , what can we say in support <unk w="of"/> the euro ?

First of all , the <unk w="commission"/> 's success has exceeded expectations , not only of all its opponents , of course , but even of all its supporters .

During the conversations which I had with the most eminent monetary experts between 1995 and 2000 , they were <unk w="little"/> sceptical about the possibility of introducing the euro and making it a success .

In 10 years the euro has become the number <unk w="of"/> currency in the world and , as has been mentioned just now , one of the most respected currencies .

Without the <unk w="introduction"/> of the euro , mainland Europe would be currently turned upside down by a monetary tornado , which would deepen the economic crisis .

We are expecting <unk w="our"/> monetary policy to try to <unk w="improve"/> , within the <unk w="framework"/> of the currency 's power , the depressing impact of the crisis and to pave the way for the return to non-inflationary growth , which we are not tackling yet , by which time the sizeable public deficits and level of debt triggered by the crisis ought to have been cleared .

We must be careful <unk w="not"/> to try to give the euro a global dimension , which would flatter our vanity , <unk w="which"/> would multiply the risks we <unk w="have"/> .

The euro is Europe 's currency and must express its distinct culture , promoting a rational and <unk w="democratic"/> model among the world 's other currencies .

It seems to me that we could call on the European Central <unk w="bank"/> to carry out this process of restoring order and supervise its implementation , according to Article 106 ( 5 ) of the Maastricht <unk w="treaty"/> .

Indeed , we need a strong impetus , expertise and a decision timetable which the European Central Bank could draw up <unk w="and"/> which the Council of Ministers for the euro area , presided by your good self , Mr Juncker , could then adopt and implement .

I will conclude , Mr President , by saying that the symbol of <unk w="danger"/> represented by the euro <unk w="a"/> success <unk w="will"/> give us the courage to take the <unk w="first"/> step in creating this increasingly <unk w="in"/> Europe as recommended under the various treaties and which we are endeavouring to achieve .

Let us counter the inevitability of failure <unk w="and"/> the energy of success .

It demonstrates the <unk w="best"/> that Europe can achieve when everyone <unk w="accepts"/> forces .

I also want , of course , on this occasion to salute and thank on our behalf , on our children 's behalf and on everyone else 's behalf , the founding fathers and the architects of this success : Pierre Werner , who is with us , Chancellor Helmut Schmidt , President Giscard d 'Estaing , the <unk w="president"/> of the European Commission Jacques Delors , Chancellor Helmut Kohl , President Fran√ßois Mitterrand , Baron Alexandre Lamfalussy , Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa , Philippe Maystadt and everyone else whom I have not mentioned .

I <unk w="would"/> also , however , like to <unk w="pay"/> tribute to the actions of your predecessors , <unk w="mr"/> President , the actions of my predecessors , Karl <unk w="von"/> Wogau , who is still with us , and of Christa Randzio-Plath , who <unk w="is"/> also with us today .

The actions of this Parliament played a crucial role in that , at the time of the transition to the euro , we were not only concerned about the transfer of accounts in the banks but also about <unk w="the"/> citizens , so that they could adapt to , get used to and adopt this new currency which was going to be theirs .

I also believe that this action by our <unk w="group"/> must be recalled and given credit .

I am also pleased that this ceremony can take place here , in the European Parliament , the home <unk w="of"/> democracy for all Europe 's citizens .

However , <unk w="we"/> themselves have adopted the euro as a symbol <unk w="of"/> belonging to the European Union .

<unk w="there"/> were 11 of us to start with , and now there are <unk w="problems"/> .

However , I do get the feeling that this crisis is tempting some countries to reconsider whether they should belong to <unk w="the"/> euro area <unk w="or"/> not .

Europe makes progress , as is so often the case , <unk w="thereby"/> demonstrating its <unk w="position"/> and on this occasion to mark its 10th anniversary , we can clearly see that the assessment of <unk w="the"/> euro is largely a positive one .

Some countries which were hesitant could now knock on the door of the euro <unk w="externally"/> .

We can only encourage them to do this under the terms of the Treaty , which have never <unk w="been"/> revised and which are useful terms <unk w="for"/> Europe to progress in economic and monetary matters on the basis of the two pillars of consolidation and enlargement .

The euro , which has been enriched by these last 10 years , must now open up <unk w="to"/> areas for development , not that we have not dealt with these at all , but simply because they are <unk w="to"/> work in progress ahead of us .

In this <unk w="way"/> crisis we all know that , if we had made progress in the Economic Union as quickly as we have in the Monetary Union , we would be even better off today .

It is not normal for Member States to borrow at such different rates of interest when they have the same currency and the same rate of interest set by <unk w="the"/> European Central Bank .

President <unk w="prodi"/> d 'Estaing mentioned Article 105 ( 6 ) , which is our common platform , allowing us to make progress .

If the European Central Bank sees its responsibilities strengthened , <unk w="there"/> will have to be indicated how the institutional balance on the whole needs to be established in the future .

I agree that we must not demand the exorbitant privilege of being <unk w="a"/> reserve currency .

<unk w="however"/> , it is not normal either for us to have taken 10 years to create the euro and then , 10 years after the transition to the euro , we are still passive in the international arena and the strong voice of the euro is not being heard more clearly in the process of restoring some balance to the global monetary system .

We must then use this wonderful creation , this symbol of Europe to <unk w="help"/> our citizens come <unk w="to"/> this crisis in the best conditions possible .

Mr President , 10 <unk w="%"/> of the euro is indeed a reason to celebrate .

Anyone who had said 10 years ago that the euro would have developed as splendidly as it has <unk w=","/> would have been laughed at .

Many people have contributed <unk w="to"/> this success , <unk w="and"/> I remember <unk w="some"/> sceptical voices - it was referred to as a premature baby and an unviable project - and today we know that it was a vision to which many people contributed .

The previous speaker reminded us of all those who contributed to this , of the milestones , of the European monetary system , which was an agreement with <unk w="the"/> European Central <unk w="bank"/> to create central rates , <unk w="as"/> the Delors report , which provided for the introduction of the monetary union in three stages , of the Treaty of Maastricht - only two years after the fall of the Wall - and of the transitional periods .

<unk w="these"/> people have helped <unk w="to"/> make the euro the successful project it is today .

As the committee chairman , Mrs Ber√®s , has already said , during this period , in particular from 1994 <unk w="to"/> the implementation of the Treaty <unk w="of"/> Maastricht began , and up to 2002 , Parliament actively cooperated in the introduction <unk w="of"/> the notes and coins , <unk w="and"/> in many reports , discussions , opinions and also proposals , and I would like <unk w="also"/> to thank the two committee chairmen from that time , Mr von Wogau and <unk w="mrs"/> Randzio-Plath , who also represented Parliament to the outside world and who gave this project , although originally created by the governments , the parliamentary support it needed .

We are working today , too , <unk w="in"/> the chairmanship of Mrs Ber√®s , for the same representation .

On 18 November Parliament adopted , with a large majority , a report in which we describe the successes , challenges , risks and problems , <unk w="and"/> I would like to mention just a few things in addition to what Mrs Ber√®s <unk w="has"/> said .

The euro has been a great success , and it is a unique project : a central monetary policy <unk w="in"/> the management of the European Central Bank <unk w="on"/> local budgetary and finance policies .

<unk w="it"/> is important that , in future , the connection <unk w="between"/> these two levels <unk w="of"/> responsibility in the Stability and Growth Pact are retained also during times of crisis .

Without this Stability and Growth Pact , without stronger coordination of the budgetary and finance policy , the euro would also in future face risks that <unk w="are"/> avoidable .

In this regard , I appeal in particular to the Member States of the euro area , but also to the whole of the European Union , to take this discipline , this <unk w="is"/> cooperation , more seriously than has been the case in the past in connection with certain issues .

The <unk w="commission"/> has pushed down inflation considerably and so created confidence and stability , and it has become the second most commonly held reserve currency in a space of time that no one thought it capable of .

The institutions of the euro area - <unk w="which"/> were mentioned by the previous speaker - the Ecofin Council , the Euro Group and many other <unk w="countries"/> have created the necessary conditions together with the Commission and the European Central Bank , <unk w="as"/> they were already operating , because they were in place , because they worked independently in order <unk w="to"/> react quickly , reliably and correctly in the economic crisis .

We have experienced the euro as a lever for creating a European financial <unk w="framework"/> .

There are numerous specific requests and demands to take the risks seriously : the drifting apart of the national economies , which is associated with considerable risks in connection with the growth of wages and with budget deficits , <unk w="will"/> not be concealed <unk w="in"/> this anniversary .

We are currently seeing the interest rate margin , which has no doubt decreased , increasing again , bringing the possibility of new problems in this regard for <unk w="the"/> Member States within the euro area .

I would remind the House that , particularly in connection with the expansion of the euro area , no special rebates may be given and that all states that are members of the euro <unk w="area"/> can , and must , comply <unk w="with"/> these conditions of the Treaty of Maastricht .

Mr President , Mr Giscard d 'Estaing , Mr <unk w="president"/> , Mr Trichet , Mr Almunia , ladies and gentlemen , many good points have already been made .

Yet the idea that Europe could create a single currency , whose foundations were laid especially in the Bremen agreement on the monetary system in 1978 and the creation of the ecu , would <unk w="have"/> been met at the time with scepticism from the markets and <unk w="the"/> main monetary authorities outside Europe .

We should warmly thank and <unk w="congratulate"/> all <unk w="those"/> who made the decision and whose names have been mentioned here .

<unk w="the"/> creation of the euro is the best proof that Europe is capable , given the political will , to take long-term decisions for a common , prosperous future .

This anniversary , then , <unk w="giving"/> us a particularly apt message of hope for today 's times .

It must be said , however , that among our fellow citizens and until recently there were mixed perceptions of <unk w="the"/> euro .

When the euro has risen against the dollar , we have also heard comments from some <unk w="members"/> who for the most part produce in the euro area but sell outside this area .

<unk w="the"/> European Central Bank has not been without its critics , who have not called into question its independence but rather its policy on interest rates , which seemed to be too high .

We all <unk w="know"/> that the euro is a determining factor in restricting the European repercussions of a crisis imported from the United <unk w="states"/> .

The European Central Bank has certainly been the most <unk w="important"/> central bank .

What would the situation have been <unk w="in"/> the various Member States had each had to defend their own individual currency ?

Devaluations would have <unk w="been"/> inevitable and we would not have avoided a currency crisis .

The welcome results of the euro must <unk w="enable"/> us to continue and to broaden the coordination of economic policies and to respect the principles of the Stability and Growth Pact .

It is true , at present , that exceptions may and perhaps should be <unk w="done"/> , but they can only be temporary and the objective of balanced public finances must be retained .

<unk w="what"/> are the condition for the solidity of our currency , the euro .

As I was able to play a <unk w="role"/> as a member of the Ecofin Council during the period of preparation for <unk w="the"/> future single currency , I could see the doubts on both sides of the argument and the pussyfooting of the Member States , which ultimately made the Eurogroup into a stronger <unk w="project"/> for cooperation ahead of its time .

Furthermore , two of Europe 's finest achievements came about through the determination of a few states to forge ahead <unk w="with"/> making integration something real for all our fellow citizens .

I am referring to the Schengen Agreement entailing the free movement of Europeans , which was implemented on the initiative of five states : France , with President Mitterrand , Germany , <unk w="the"/> Chancellor <unk w="too"/> , along with the Benelux countries .

<unk w="it"/> has now become part of the Schengen area , but the British and Irish are still shying away from this people 's Europe .

President Mitterrand and Chancellor Kohl were also the political architects of the euro , even though there were many who supported this <unk w="great"/> success , starting with Jacques Delors .

The first lesson I would like to draw from this is that anyone who wants a better Europe must not be afraid of intergovernmental action , especially if there is a coalition of <unk w="action"/> which really <unk w="wants"/> to move Europe forward .

The <unk w="maastricht"/> Treaty , which is intended to combat serious crime , is an example of this positive enhanced cooperation for Europe .

At a time when <unk w="the"/> Constitutional <unk w="revision"/> is dead and buried , following the ' no ' vote from a strange coalition of political forces not only in France but in the Netherlands too , and when the indigestible piece of legislation known as the ' mini ' Treaty of Lisbon <unk w="is"/> being blocked <unk w="by"/> Ireland <unk w=","/> possibly in the Czech Republic as well , we should prove that Europe is <unk w="not"/> functioning by relying on the huge area of enhanced cooperation .

<unk w="we"/> are fretting about not being able to benefit <unk w="themselves"/> from the protective shield provided by the euro .

Thanks to the consistent actions of Wim Duisenberg , Jean-Claude Trichet and the likes , the euro has become the world 's second reserve currency in <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> years .

Of course , the dollar remains king for global transactions , still <unk w="in"/> a safe <unk w="way"/> , but the colossal debts accumulated by the United States in getting the rest of <unk w="the"/> world to finance their lifestyle will increasingly sow the seeds of doubt as to the ability of the number one economic power to honour its commitments .

In fact , the financial world <unk w="has"/> tending towards a euro / dollar <unk w="""/> .

In these times of widespread recession , the world <unk w="of"/> stability and new certainties .

The euro will have a key <unk w="role"/> to play in this new stability .

The <unk w="european"/> Central Bank ( ECB ) has done what it needed to do in the face of a global financial crisis ' made in the USA ' .

As Jacques Delors said , the euro is the shield to protect the whole of Europe , but the euro <unk w="has"/> not stimulated the European economy enough so far .

At the end of the day , the Commission is only a first-class consultant making suggestions <unk w="which"/> are generally useful , but the real economic players remain the states themselves which , unfortunately , are operating in a disorganised manner .

Although the effective harmonisation of the cumulative <unk w="nuclear"/> power of 27 states could work miracles , the Eurogroup , in spite of the commendable efforts of Jean-Claude <unk w="terrorists"/> , <unk w="not"/> only remains an informal discussion <unk w="today"/> .

In the spring of 1999 , I was able <unk w="to"/> witness the <unk w="interview"/> made <unk w="by"/> the Eurogroup by a few finance ministers , including Oskar Lafontaine , Dominique <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , Carlo Ciampi and a few others , to establish <unk w="economic"/> and monetary <unk w="policy"/> between the European Union and the European Central Bank .

Wim Duisenberg made the cutting retort : ' there never will be any ex-ante coordination <unk w="between"/> the European Central Bank as you are always going to have to react ex-post to our decisions . '

The <unk w="reason"/> for this is obvious : the ECB is and will remain <unk w="vigilant"/> in conducting its monetary policy , but independence does not mean a ban on constructive dialogue between institutions tasked with defending the <unk w="values"/> and common destiny of 500 million Europeans .

There is nothing to prevent states from organising themselves better with regard to achieving proper coordination of their economic policies , whether it is inside the EU <unk w=","/> especially when representing Europe externally , as Jean-Claude Juncker so sensibly concluded just now .

Mr President , Mr Giscard d 'Estaing , Mr Juncker , Mr Trichet , Mr Almunia , ladies and gentlemen , I find it very regrettable that relatively few Members are here today for this <unk w="plenary"/> sitting , because it really is a historic <unk w="success"/> .

<unk w="it"/> was felt that the logistical challenges involved in introducing billions of banknotes and coins alone would be unmanageable , and the <unk w="fact"/> that we could combine a common monetary policy with separate fiscal policies in the Member States was seen not just as a major challenge but as simply impossible .

This is something of a minor political miracle , and once <unk w="again"/> the words of Walter Hallstein , the first President of the Commission , have proven to be true : ' Anyone who does not believe in miracles in European matters is not a realist . '

The <unk w="safety"/> of the citizens , many of whom , in many Member States , initially believed that <unk w="the"/> euro <unk w="will"/> result in huge price hikes , have now disappeared .

It has become something of a visible European identifier : besides the anthem and the flag , it <unk w="is"/> one of the few symbols we have today .

It could , I think , be said that , in the European Central Bank 's first few years , Europe and the European <unk w="union"/> were sailing in relatively calm waters , so that the bank found <unk w="it"/> pretty easy to pursue a policy of stability .

Even so , it is worth pointing out <unk w="what"/> the mean <unk w="interest"/> rate over <unk w="the"/> first 10 years of the euro has been approximately 2 % , in other words more or less on the target that the European Central Bank set itself .

It has proven itself to be independent , efficient and self-confident , and it acts <unk w="quickly"/> and <unk w="terrorism"/> .

It has made it quite clear to the Federal Reserve in the United States that it can pursue a successful policy , not despite its independence but precisely because it is politically independent and not subject to instructions <unk w="from"/> various governments .

We now <unk w="hope"/> that <unk w="at"/> the moment , after the banking sectors in the individual Member States have been brought under a protective umbrella , the Member States are in the process of developing various economic stimulus plans to absorb <unk w="the"/> negative impact of the financial crisis on the real economy .

This will present the European Central Bank with further challenges , because there is a <unk w="risk"/> that the differences in approach will <unk w="result"/> in <unk w="terms"/> of competition , and that the convergence we <unk w="have"/> , in part , now achieved between the members of the euro area will <unk w="be"/> lost and we will see increasingly divergent developments .

This needs to be counteracted , which is why it is so crucial and so important that <unk w="the"/> Stability and Growth Pact must not be undermined or discarded .

Quite the <unk w="opposite"/> : we must ensure that it remains valid .

The European Central <unk w="bank"/> will gain a new task in the coming years .

<unk w="this"/> crisis has taught us that we need some kind of European supervision of the financial market , and this is an area where the European Central <unk w="bank"/> can play a major role .

It has signalled that it is , in principle , willing to introduce some kind <unk w="of"/> central European supervisory system analogous <unk w="within"/> the European System of Central Banks .

The euro area needs to speak with one voice , and <unk w="must"/> be represented as a unit in international organisations such as the International Monetary Fund and the OECD ( Organisation for <unk w="sustainable"/> Co-operation and Development ) .

It is still true that a single currency without a single fiscal economic policy is , and <unk w="will"/> continue to be , a risky undertaking .

The EU is still facing some major challenges : we are facing high , and unfortunately rising , levels of unemployment , demographic changes , migratory pressures , increasing poverty in some <unk w="sectors"/> of society , and stiffer competition in the context of globalisation .

The euro <unk w="system"/> will only be able to meet these challenges if the economic policies of <unk w="the"/> Member States can be more closely interlinked .

The appointment of a president of the euro area was the first step in this direction , but it is only the <unk w="first"/> step : more is now needed .

Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , after 10 years , the growing space carved out by the euro in international trade and <unk w="the"/> use <unk w="of"/> a reserve currency show <unk w="that"/> it has become a world benchmark .

It has guaranteed monetary stability and has helped integrate the economies of the Member States that have adopted it , despite some errors of judgment that created problems for citizens both because <unk w="of"/> the actual exchange rates between national currencies <unk w="in"/> the euro and because <unk w="only"/> the few checks subsequently carried out on <unk w="the"/> prices of goods and services .

The euro was created without being imposed <unk w="by"/> outside and without any wars of <unk w="economic"/> or political hegemonies .

It was the result of the free coming together of <unk w="the"/> governments who believed in the creation of an economic and monetary union , as laid down in <unk w="the"/> Treaties , as an essential step in attempting to achieve the political union that still unfortunately remains out of our grasp .

<unk w="the"/> problems that have <unk w="made"/> are due to inefficiencies in a system that was unprepared for the <unk w="lack"/> of guiding the other great associated phenomenon ; I am talking about the increasing pace of internationalisation and the great changes in <unk w="the"/> way trade <unk w="is"/> conducted at international level .

The measures introduced by the European Central Bank ( ECB ) and the Commission to combat the current crisis have acted as a buffer and a form of containment <unk w=","/> we still maintain , as we have often done in <unk w="this"/> Chamber , that we find it inconceivable to have a monetary policy disconnected from economic policy .

Admittedly , the actual situation is somewhat anomalous : 16 Member States with the <unk w="single"/> currency , 27 <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> economic policies coordinated by the Commission as well as it can , and 11 Member States with national currencies .

Coordinating a monetary policy with an economic policy that does not actually exist is certainly no mean feat , but if <unk w="the"/> institutions responsible for economic policies in our countries do not communicate with the central banks and the ECB , which has to pull all those policies <unk w="besides"/> , and vice versa , the European Union will find new difficulties in jointly facing up to <unk w="the"/> current crisis and also the continual challenges that the outside <unk w="union"/> and globalisation bring home to us .

We hope that <unk w="better"/> experiences convince people of the need to face up to change in Europe , restoring the real economy to the centre and ensuring better cohesion and connection between the ECB and the European institutions responsible <unk w="for"/> laying down political and <unk w="economic"/> strategy .

The very recent <unk w="economic"/> crisis has also shown us that a common economic policy on the main strategic topics is of vital interest to the public and cannot be <unk w="involved"/> .

Mr President , Mr Giscard d 'Estaing , Mr Juncker , Mr Trichet , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to remind you how , in 1992 , when it was still completely <unk w="unacceptable"/> as to whether the French would vote in favour of the Maastricht Treaty , Jacques Delors spoke to the general assembly of the French Green Party , which managed to deliver the missing 1 % or 2 % .

He said to us : ' Vote for the euro , then we will have a political Europe , <unk w="even"/> if we do <unk w="not"/> create a political Europe to control Europe , the people will not accept it ; <unk w="we"/> will never accept it . '

<unk w="this"/> is the very problem which we are facing today .

Firstly , it seemed to us that the Maastricht criteria were going to drag Europe into at least five years <unk w="of"/> pro-cyclical recessionary policy <unk w="and"/> , secondly , the way in which the monetary policy was incorporated into the general economic policy by the Maastricht Treaty was not satisfactory .

For the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of the European Central Bank 's independence , we would separate monetary policy from the rest of the policies .

I must say quite honestly that , even if I <unk w="am"/> still not convinced by the Maastricht Treaty today , like all the other Greens , I am rather attracted by the changes which the legislation <unk w="in"/> application of Economic and Monetary Union have undergone .

At the moment , when the world is being threatened by deflation and the situation is being aggravated by the tendency of some countries to hastily cut their VAT rate as part of a Keynesian policy , it is obvious that setting this target of 2 % is no longer just for <unk w="it"/> .

If we fail to keep <unk w="up"/> this 2 % <unk w="when"/> we run the risk of <unk w="the"/> very high real interest <unk w="is"/> being forced on us .

The second major reform is obviously the reform of the Stability and Growth <unk w="pact"/> carried out in 2005 , which allows us today to have a policy that is contracyclical and aimed at countering the crisis .

The third major transformation is the change to how things <unk w="are"/> in <unk w="practice"/> .

This permanent dialogue , as <unk w="we"/> once again in this Chamber , between Mr Trichet , Mr Almunia , Mr Juncker and Mr Barroso , is , strictly speaking , contrary to the Maastricht Treaty itself .

I regard this form of <unk w="contact"/> between Mr Trichet and Mr Almunia , for example , to be the equivalent of that between Mr Bernanke and Mr Paulson , which <unk w="is"/> a positive and desirable development .

All I would say is that we need to apply properly the good aspects of <unk w="the"/> Maastricht Treaty .

We have a real problem in defining the exchange rate , which has been mentioned on several occasions by <unk w="our"/> predecessors .

We <unk w="must"/> find the means to ensure that the Council sets an exchange <unk w="rate"/> for Europe which does not derive randomly from the interest rate chosen by the European Central Bank , but properly reflects an industrial policy .

Secondly , the European Central Bank 's objective is not only to <unk w="achieve"/> a rate close to 2 % but also to apply Europe 's policy , by that I mean <unk w="the"/> Lisbon and Gothenburg Strategies .

Lastly , as has already been mentioned , there needs to be supervision at a <unk w="global"/> level and the European Central <unk w="bank"/> is in the best position <unk w="to"/> perform this function .

It is regrettable that we are not taking <unk w="advantage"/> of this opportunity for an in-depth examination of the consequences of implementing neoliberal and monetarist policies - using the euro as an excuse - which have contributed to the current serious social situation and to <unk w="social"/> inequality , unemployment , precarious and poorly paid work , and poverty .

It is unacceptable that we are holding onto ideological dogmas , such as price stability and the irrational criteria of the Stability and <unk w="growth"/> Pact , which are being used as a pretext in order to pursue privatisation and remove responsibility for social <unk w="protection"/> from the state .

This approach also involves the idea of <unk w="a"/> minimal state and the greater efficiency <unk w="of"/> the private sector , with the aim of imposing acceptance of so-called wage restraint , which actually results in low , nominal wage rises and even a reduction in real wages , as the Portuguese case regrettably clearly demonstrates .

We cannot agree with the false independence of the European Central Bank , which is dragging its heels on the decisions to reduce interest rates and which is keeping <unk w="the"/> euro overvalued solely <unk w="to"/> protect those countries with more developed economies and the more powerful economic <unk w="and"/> financial groups , thus worsening the hardships of <unk w="the"/> more fragile economies and those people with fewer financial resources .

This European Central Bank policy has resulted in the contraction of the European <unk w="union"/> , clearly demonstrating the need for further reductions in the reference interest rates .

<unk w="improving"/> the purchasing power <unk w="of"/> workers , the retired and pensioners has fallen <unk w="over"/> the last 10 years , the profits of economic and financial groups have reached their highest level in 30 years , resulting in the joy and satisfaction that we have heard in this Chamber .

Even now , in the crisis situation <unk w=","/> they have caused , what they are doing is nationalising the damage in order to then privatise the profits , whilst workers , micro- and small entrepreneurs , the <unk w="farmers"/> and the unemployed <unk w="and"/> the consequences of the <unk w="environment"/> , with the right , in the best-case scenario , only to a few scraps .

Look at what is happening in <unk w="the"/> financial sector , where certain banks have already increased their spreads more than once since the start of the financial crisis <unk w=","/> where the margin charged has doubled in the space of a year , thereby penalising new credit even more .

<unk w="we"/> therefore insist on the urgent need for a proper break <unk w="between"/> these neoliberal and monetarist policies , putting an end to the Stability <unk w="pact"/> , <unk w="tax"/> havens and the false independence of the European Central Bank .

We therefore insist on the need to support production and micro- , small and medium-sized enterprises ; to promote quality public services ; to facilitate credit and improve the purchasing power <unk w="of"/> families , and not just the most disadvantaged , but also the middle classes ; to create more <unk w="insecurity"/> , and to reduce the poverty and misery of millions <unk w="of"/> people in our countries .

on behalf of the IND / DEM <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> . - Mr President , do enjoy the 10th birthday of the <unk w="house"/> because I very much doubt you will be celebrating the 20th .

Do you remember when the five-year plans were announced to be successes often before they were even <unk w="worse"/> , with much talk <unk w="of"/> record harvests and wonderful production figures for tractors ?

Much like those days , we have been <unk w="here"/> this morning to a succession of unelected , ageing bureaucrats telling us what a great success the whole thing has been .

Of course none of this surprises me because what this euro is all about is a political class imposing its will <unk w="on"/> the peoples of Europe .

Remember that only two countries - Denmark and Sweden - had a <unk w="impact"/> on the euro and both of them said ' no ' , that little word that you try and avoid if you possibly <unk w="do"/> .

<unk w="categories"/> of young people out on the streets demonstrating , demanding their <unk w="view"/> does something , demanding that their government cuts rates , demanding that their government devalues .

When people have taken away from them the ability to <unk w="develop"/> their own futures through <unk w="the"/> ballot box , then I am <unk w="convinced"/> that violence becomes the only logical <unk w="one"/> .

You have trapped people in a V√∂lkerkerker <unk w="in"/> which it will <unk w="have"/> great courage to get out .

It will take leadership , or possibly the <unk w="european"/> economic meltdown .

Jeer on if you like , but have you noticed that <unk w="in"/> the bond markets this morning Greek bonds are trading 233 <unk w="per"/> points higher than German bonds ?

Now I <unk w="think"/> that most of you in this room will not even know what that means and those that do will do their best to ignore it .

You can go on burying your heads <unk w="of"/> the sand if you want .

You can <unk w="assure"/> the markets if you want to , but in time the markets will not ignore you .

Mr President , in the last 200 years there have <unk w="been"/> at least half a dozen attempts to create single currencies or fixed exchange rate mechanisms .

Spain 's experience is like the <unk w="situation"/> in the corrida : proud and strong to start with , but bleeding to death in the sand by the end .

We in Britain can thank heaven that we kept our own currency and are not part <unk w="of"/> the euro zone 's slow-motion train wreck .

in writing . - The tenth anniversary of <unk w="the"/> vote on the proposal , presented to Parliament , on behalf of the Council of <unk w="ministers"/> , by Gordon <unk w="kinnock"/> ( then president of the Council ) , <unk w="in"/> lock exchange rates at that day 's level and <unk w="to"/> create the euro , is an opportunity to celebrate ten <unk w="years"/> of success , stability and strength <unk w="and"/> what is now one of the two leading currencies in the world .

The current economic crisis would have been compounded by turmoil on currency markets had we <unk w="always"/> had the peseta , <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , drachma and so on as separate currencies fluctuating wildly against <unk w="each"/> other .

The anniversary is also an opportunity to debate whether <unk w="parliament"/> 's long-term economic <unk w="solution"/> lies with euro <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> .

Of course , Britain can <unk w=","/> in the short run outside the euro , but over time , we stand to lose out : our businesses are handicapped in the European market by conversion costs and hedging costs that their competitors in that market do not face ; and inward investors into the European market will prefer to be in the major <unk w="free-trade"/> area rather than the smaller one .

The <unk w="friday"/> sitting of the European Parliament marking the 10th anniversary of Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) at a time of serious crisis in the <unk w="new"/> system follows repeated resolutions and reports by the European Parliament on the same subject and is yet another attempt <unk w="to"/> gild the pill of the anti-grassroots , anti-labour policy of the EU which , following the demise of socialism , proceeded to the Maastricht Treaty and its all-out <unk w="convention"/> on labour rights and freedoms .

EMU , the establishment of the European Central <unk w="bank"/> and the launch of the euro are <unk w="the"/> links in the chain of capitalist restructurings being promoted by capital in order to defend <unk w="them"/> against workers ' claims and safeguard its profitability by stepping up the exploitation of the working class and grassroots classes .

The arguments about price stability , reducing inflation and protecting economies from risk and crisis have proven to <unk w="be"/> stale arguments .

This past decade , workers have seen their incomes <unk w="on-line"/> , industrial relations worsen , their insurance rights evaporate and health and education services deteriorate and made into privatised commodities .

Workers reject the European one-way street and its supporters , and also the Lisbon Strategy and the Lisbon Treaty , and are <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> against EMU and the EU itself for grassroots power and a grassroots economy .

In the debate about the euro I want to draw attention to three <unk w="key"/> aspects of its performance .

Firstly , from <unk w="the"/> moment when the euro was introduced , in other words from 2002 to 2007 inclusive , the <unk w="individual"/> Member States which were outside the euro area ( England , <unk w="ireland"/> and Denmark ) developed faster than <unk w="the"/> countries which were in the euro area .

Gross national income <unk w="for"/> those countries grew almost twice as fast as the average for the euro area , and the level of unemployment was lower .

Secondly , the battle with the effects of the current financial and economic crisis is clearly more effective in those countries than in the <unk w="free-trade"/> area .

Thirdly , new Member States which are preparing to enter the euro area have to <unk w="deal"/> with many monetary and fiscal criteria two years before entry .

Some of these criteria are mutually contradictory , such as the need to be present in the ERM II system - and therefore the need to maintain the national currency 's <unk w="interest"/> rate against the euro within a fluctuation band of ¬± 15 % - and at the same time to maintain a low level of <unk w="safety"/> .

Counteracting devaluation pressure on the national currency means the need for intervention by central <unk w="america"/> , which means putting greater amounts of the national currency into circulation , which obviously increases inflationary pressure .

Mr President , ladies <unk w="and"/> gentlemen , European Economic and Monetary Union began on 1 <unk w="december"/> 1999 , and 11 EU Member States <unk w="to"/> the single currency at the same time .

<unk w="this"/> is something the countries that have been left out of the euro area have been made painfully aware of .

Although the 10th anniversary of the euro is overshadowed by worries of a possible deepening of <unk w="the"/> recession , I trust in the euro area 's ability to emerge from the crisis .

According to the latest <unk w="information"/> , the effect of the agreed stimulus package will be considerably less than the 1.5 % of gross domestic product planned for the <unk w="future"/> .

The euro <unk w="has"/> been an unquestionable success , but would not have been but for the continuous efforts made .

We have to <unk w="respond"/> to the basic principles and <unk w="principles"/> of Economic and Monetary Union .

On 1 <unk w="december"/> 2009 the euro became the official currency of Slovakia .

<unk w="from"/> that date , the double <unk w="ban"/> on three hills from the Slovak flag has also appeared on one-euro and two-euro coins and has been put into circulation across the euro area .

That day was a historic moment for <unk w="europe"/> and we Slovaks are very proud to be the first country from the <unk w="french"/> Socialist bloc to introduce the euro in this symbolic year of the 10th anniversary of <unk w="the"/> euro area .

I am appreciative of the fact that the current Slovak Government has subscribed to the commitment of Mikul√°≈° Dzurinda , whose <unk w="objective"/> , in autumn 2004 , adopted a plan to replace the koruna <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="single"/> currency and fixed the beginning of 2009 as the target date .

It also seems appropriate here on the floor of the EP to thank the Slovak people because it was they , as the main actors in the challenging but <unk w="the"/> ' Dzurinda ' reforms , who persevered and helped Slovakia to become a successful European country .

From 1 January 2009 the euro <unk w="will"/> link the people of Slovakia to the Union every day .

The introduction of the European single currency 10 years ago marked the completion of a process whose <unk w="proposals"/> go far beyond the economic sector .

The euro 's success therefore means success in the <unk w="process"/> of building an entity designed to promote European values at international level and confirm the European Union as the main player in business and financial relations within the global economy .

I believe that the benefits offered by adopting <unk w="the"/> euro , involving macroeconomic stability , a significant reduction in price <unk w="stability"/> , the <unk w="issue"/> of job creation and support for productivity growth , all underpinned by strengthening resistance to external shocks , justify all the efforts made by the new Member States , especially Romania , to meet the convergence criteria as soon as possible and join the euro area .

Since the euro was launched <unk w="on"/> 1 January 1999 , the single currency has , in many respects , proven to be an important factor in the stability of the EU economy .

The single <unk w="market"/> is , first of all , a driving force for European exchanges : the disappearance of exchange rates in the euro countries is <unk w="an"/> important and visible benefit for citizens , and promotes mobility <unk w="within"/> the EU .

In addition to the obvious benefits , the euro has also emerged <unk w="from"/> an anchor in the financial crisis .

Only a major currency <unk w=","/> by many Member States and national economies is able to cushion the dramatic effects of economic collapse .

Monetary union means that macroeconomic levers can <unk w="be"/> applied at international level and <unk w="that"/> responses can be made to the financial crisis .

Finally , though , <unk w="the"/> euro is <unk w="also"/> a symbol of European integration and the long road that the European people have already travelled together .

Monetary union is the next logical step after <unk w="the"/> union , and should also pave the way for <unk w="future"/> European integration .

Nearly one year ago , when marking the 10th anniversary of the creation of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) and Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) , we highlighted the fact that : ' In the ten years it has been <unk w="in"/> existence , the results achieved by EMU are a resounding success . '

I think that this assessment is quite appropriate as I <unk w="have"/> a strong believer in the importance of the solidarity which Member States need to show in their joint actions to combat the effects of the financial crisis and reduce the adverse impact of <unk w="the"/> global economic crisis .

In <unk w="the"/> climate , marking the 10th anniversary of the introduction of the euro must refocus our attention on the major European integration projects .

Furthermore , EMU members ' diverse interests must take <unk w="a"/> priority to the EU <unk w="'s"/> common economic interests .

Madam President , we do seem to be having rather a lot of roll-call votes <unk w="at"/> the moment , which is a little irksome for people like me whose <unk w="facts"/> are <unk w="not"/> working .

When we have formal sittings here , there is always a camera in the middle of the seating <unk w="process"/> .

It is not <unk w="not"/> exactly easy for the camera operators to work there ; it is also , however , a problem for Members if there is a camera where we want to work .

If not , someone really <unk w="has"/> to come up with a better technical solution .

Madam President , I have been trying <unk w="a"/> wave to an usher throughout the voting procedure in order to give explanations of vote , but because you conducted votes so brilliantly and we got through them so quickly , an usher has not quite made it too me yet .

I am holding a piece of paper asking to give two oral explanations of vote on the <unk w="swoboda"/> and Breyer reports .

Madam President , likewise , if I <unk w="would"/> have the same forbearance .

I <unk w="cannot"/> get such an opportunity to make myself heard by so <unk w="much"/> .

It falls to me <unk w="in"/> this <unk w="time"/> to explain my vote in favour of the report by Mr <unk w="bushill-matthews"/> on trade and economic relations with <unk w="the"/> Balkans .

I am absolutely in favour of the European Union making it as easy as possible for these Balkan states to join the <unk w="european"/> Union .

I believe that it is important for economic aid to be higher than that allocated to date , and that we should <unk w="make"/> it possible to increase links between the Balkan states and Europe , develop tourism and allow all Balkan citizens , young and old , to live a better life than they <unk w="stay"/> until now .

I <unk w="cannot"/> agree with the point that we need to <unk w="encourage"/> the CAP to meet food <unk w="safety"/> concerns and the fact that farmers need a stable policy environment in order to plan for the future .

If we look at particular EU proposals , for example on plant protection , again we need a proper detailed impact assessment on that , and we need to take food security <unk w="into"/> consideration when we conduct that assessment .

Madam President , I would like <unk w="to"/> thank colleagues for their endorsement of this report and <unk w="his"/> Harkin for her words of support .

It presents a clear statement <unk w="in"/> the view of this House on agriculture policy , <unk w="not"/> just at the European level , but also at a global level .

In particular - and this is important - it calls for a refocus on agriculture policy in the developing <unk w="countries"/> , providing assistance to those who can produce food to do so locally .

I believe the EUR 1 billion <unk w="of"/> the European Union will provide for this purpose is a step in the right <unk w="direction"/> .

While the food security debate has gone off the political agenda , the problem of 30 000 children dying <unk w="'s"/> hunger and starvation every day remains with us .

It focuses on a very important aspect of the European <unk w="union"/> and that is the absolute <unk w="objective"/> of ensuring food supplies to those who are starving or those who do not have a <unk w="good"/> food supply .

Nobody <unk w="can"/> be against that , and I am <unk w="afraid"/> not against that .

But the <unk w="debate"/> with the report , in <unk w="my"/> view , is that it looks and refers to the common agricultural policy and does not address the fact that there is an urgent need for the reform , and further reform , of that policy .

Until that burden is taken away <unk w="from"/> the European taxpayers , then we are going <unk w="to"/> be <unk w="in"/> difficulties .

Yes , the objectives of the <unk w="resolutions"/> are right , but I am afraid that it fails very badly <unk w="in"/> addressing the core problem .

( PL ) I fully endorse most of the proposals and <unk w="measures"/> contained in the McGuinness report , which was adopted a moment ago .

Sudden fluctuations in food prices are going to occur <unk w="in"/> the global market with increasing frequency , which will have negative <unk w="effects"/> .

Price rises are felt most by low-income families , who spend a significant proportion of <unk w="the"/> budget on food .

It is just such people who deserve help : the most needy people , both in <unk w="those"/> countries and in the European Union .

I agree that the <unk w="common"/> agricultural policy <unk w="must"/> be adapted to the new <unk w="system"/> in order to better address <unk w="the"/> problems of food security , and this is why the removal of instruments which manage markets and a reduction in the level of EU expenditure on agriculture in the future financial perspective should be opposed .

It is a good idea to establish an international body which will observe the prices of agricultural products and factors of their production under the auspices of the Food and Agriculture Organization , <unk w="in"/> order to monitor these data on a world scale and to be able to react rapidly to fluctuations .

Madam President , I am grateful for this <unk w="opportunity"/> to explain why I <unk w="have"/> abstained on this report .

The problem is that we do not agree on what food <unk w="aid"/> is .

<unk w="as"/> many of us , food security is making sure that there is enough food for <unk w="the"/> people of the world - wherever they come from .

I <unk w="think"/> people using the excuse of food <unk w="or"/> to keep out imports from the rest of the world , thereby condemning the <unk w="eu"/> exports that we see from many of the poorer countries of the world and condemning many more farmers in poorer countries to poverty .

Madam <unk w="president"/> , I concur with the comments made by my excellent colleague Mr Syed Kamall <unk w="on"/> this matter .

I abstained because it was my <unk w="colleague"/> 's whip <unk w="to"/> abstain on this report , but everybody knows <unk w="that"/> food security is a <unk w="very"/> important subject to us all , which is why I am bemused by the way that this place deals with such a matter .

In this particular report - which I believe we all voted for - we mention the problem we were just about to create for ourselves by <unk w="looking"/> for the plant protection products directive .

It is a <unk w="fact"/> that nobody <unk w="still"/> seems to read some of these reports that go through this place .

Madam President , one of the biggest concerns and one of the keys in relation to global food <unk w="production"/> is to ensure sufficient , sustainable production and , <unk w="secondly"/> , food security in the so-called developed world , such as here in the EU , so that we can export our surplus production and are not competing ourselves on world markets for food , thereby increasing the prices for those in regions who do not have the climate , the soil , the know-how and the investment to <unk w="use"/> their own food .

We have to be very careful with our policies to ensure that we are responding <unk w="not"/> only environmentally but also globally to the necessity for sustainable food production .

( SK ) I voted for the report on the common agricultural policy and global food security because it deals <unk w="with"/> issues that I have consistently been <unk w="involved"/> in the European Parliament as matters of priority .

<unk w="the"/> first issues involves the reduction in <unk w="the"/> costs , which will lead to greater global competitiveness .

The third issue concerns halting the decline in the social importance of agriculture by increasing public awareness <unk w=","/> its unique and irreplaceable role .

The fifth and final issue involves putting a stop to the agricultural decline <unk w="in"/> the new Member States caused <unk w="by"/> the CAP 's discriminatory principles , while significantly boosting utilisation of wasted agricultural potential in these countries , the new Member States .

Madam President , this goes to the core of <unk w="the"/> whole European Union .

The public , on being given a chance in the Republic of Ireland , made it absolutely clear that they do not want <unk w="it"/> and if the people of Britain were to be given a chance - and they should have been because they were promised it in the last general election by the Labour Government - they would also <unk w="like"/> overwhelmingly to reject this Treaty .

People want their <unk w="own"/> governments and their own legislatures to be making the decisions that affect them .

Madam President , first of all I would <unk w="like"/> to say that this is an excellent report .

There are <unk w="two"/> types of democracy : representative , which we have in this House , and participative , which is what this report is all <unk w="about"/> .

Therefore , <unk w="the"/> concerns and ideas put forward by citizens must be taken into consideration by the EU institutions .

I think we have an excellent example of that in the one million signatures for disability and the document <unk w="which"/> we are debating in this Parliament at the moment .

I disagree with the last speaker because I believe , if we do pass the Lisbon Treaty , that it <unk w="gives"/> us the opportunity to connect citizens to the EU in a much <unk w="more"/> meaningful way .

Our role in <unk w="this"/> House <unk w="ought"/> to ensure , if we pass the Lisbon Treaty , <unk w="but"/> it works effectively .

Never mind that , as it seems periodically necessary to remind this <unk w="house"/> , the Treaty of Lisbon is not <unk w="in"/> force .

It has been three times rejected in its several forms by 55 % of French voters , by <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> % of Dutch voters and <unk w="only"/> 54 % of Irish voters .

Focus <unk w="more"/> on the Orwellian Ministry <unk w="'s"/> Love bit of the title ' Perspectives for developing civil dialogue ' .

Now , ordinary voters unversed in the peculiar idiom <unk w="of"/> the European Union might not understand those words , as we in this House do , to mean creating a new propaganda budget to try and convince people to change their minds .

I have to say that not every <unk w="word"/> in the vaults of the European Central Bank will serve to convince people of an intrinsically bad idea .

When I read the title of the report , ' Civil dialogue under the Treaty of Lisbon ' , it reminded me of a phrase by Mahatma <unk w="""/> .

When he was asked about Western civilisation , he said , that ' that would <unk w="be"/> a good idea ' .

Therefore , when I <unk w="confirm"/> this title , ' Civil dialogue under the Treaty of Lisbon ' , I thought , ' <unk w="it"/> would be a good idea , would it not ? '

One of the previous speakers said <unk w=","/> dialogue is very much a two-way process , but if we look at some of the civil society organisations being funded in order to promote the Treaty of Lisbon , we only see organisations that are fully signed up to promoting this fundamentally undemocratic Treaty .

There is no two-way dialogue , and that is why the citizens of the EU , when they are given the chance and asked about the Treaty of <unk w="nice"/> , will choose to reject it .

Madam President , thank <unk w="you"/> all for your patience in the Chamber .

If you want to look at a sustainable fisheries policy , you have <unk w="to"/> look at property rights and market-based solutions .

That is why we are seeing <unk w="the"/> depletion of fish stocks , and we will all suffer in the end .

We will return to the explanations of vote <unk w="in"/> the formal sitting .

Mr President of the Republic of Latvia , the right honourable Valdis Zatlers , it is a very great pleasure for us all <unk w="to"/> be able to welcome you today on your first visit to <unk w="the"/> European Parliament .

I should like to start by thanking you , as the President of a country which is still a relatively new Member State of the European Union , for accepting the European Parliament 's invitation to address us today , the day on which we <unk w="are"/> celebrating the 10th anniversary of our common currency , <unk w="the"/> euro .

Today is a <unk w="problem"/> in every sense of <unk w="the"/> word , as this was the first time that the European hymn has been played to welcome a guest to plenary here in the European Parliament .

May I take this opportunity to mention once again today the <unk w="political"/> significance of the enlargement of the European Union in 2004 .

Our citizens enjoy prospects that <unk w="the"/> forefathers could only have <unk w="been"/> of .

Even the people of Latvia have come to feel this quite clearly , for example as a result of the financial crisis , which has also hit your <unk w="very"/> hard , Mr <unk w="president"/> .

It is precisely in this time of crisis that we all feel the need for community and cooperation between our countries and the European <unk w="union"/> .

Together we are stronger , together we can defend our interests <unk w="and"/> values better throughout the world .

That is also why the European Parliament hopes the Lisbon Treaty , which gives the European <unk w="union"/> a stronger capacity to act to <unk w="address"/> these serious challenges , will <unk w="not"/> enter into force .

In this respect , the European Parliament elections due to take place in June this <unk w="year"/> are immensely important , because we want to push ahead with the success story of the European peace and unification project together , in a democratic European Union with a European Parliament with codecision powers in nearly every area .

I truly hope <unk w="that"/> the citizens <unk w="'"/> Latvia - and of all the other <unk w="member"/> States of the European Union - <unk w="i"/> understand that their vote is important because it gives them European powers of codecision and in this sense will turn out in force during the forthcoming elections to the <unk w="european"/> Parliament .

<unk w="mr"/> President , it gives me <unk w="a"/> pleasure to invite you now to address <unk w="the"/> European Parliament .

Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I thank the President for his kind words <unk w="in"/> introduction and his invitation to address the elected representatives of the <unk w="people"/> of Europe .

I take great pleasure in addressing the European Parliament in my mother tongue , especially because for five years now , Latvian has been one of the <unk w="other"/> languages of the European Union .

I am speaking to you today at a time when the term of office of the <unk w="other"/> Members of the European Parliament to be elected from Latvia is drawing to a close .

<unk w="one"/> of these international organisations became a strategic aim for Latvia following the restoration of independence in 1991 .

Latvia clearly expressed its wish to participate in European <unk w="union"/> transatlantic economic and security structures .

European structures were joined by nations that had long been isolated by force from them , even though the <unk w="fact"/> that lie at the heart of the European Union had historically been <unk w="included"/> in these nations .

It once again affirmed our steadfast will to live in <unk w="an"/> independent , free and democratic nation .

In the act declaring the Republic of <unk w="korea"/> in 1918 it is written that : ' All <unk w=","/> regardless of their ethnic origin are called on to give their assistance , for all human rights shall be guaranteed in Latvia .

It <unk w="would"/> be a democratic and just nation , where there shall be no room for oppression and injustice ... ' .

Thirty years before the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the Republic of <unk w="parliament"/> declared its loyalty to its fundamental values and principles .

Latvia has always felt itself to belong to Europe and its values , even when Latvia and other Central and Eastern European nations were <unk w="therefore"/> bound to a state where many values were looked <unk w="at"/> through a special ideological prism .

Peace reigned among the nations of the Eastern bloc , but it was the peace of <unk w="the"/> prison courtyard .

We have a <unk w="long"/> history , <unk w="and"/> our fates have been diverse .

That is <unk w="why"/> I should like to thank the European Parliament for the declaration adopted <unk w="on"/> 22 September last year to proclaim 23 August as the European Day of Remembrance for Victims of <unk w="terrorism"/> and Nazism .

This <unk w="also"/> reminds the people of Europe of these tragic events in the history of Latvia and the whole of Europe .

Today , I should like to look <unk w="at"/> much more recent history .

What have our nation 's achievements been and what are <unk w="the"/> challenges still <unk w="out"/> of us ?

<unk w="assure"/> our accession to the European Union , Latvia signalled its determination for <unk w="its"/> own future , its <unk w="determination"/> to found its future on a European identity and on our common values : freedom and democracy , accountability , the rule of law and human rights , equality , tolerance and prosperity .

Secondly , membership of the European Union <unk w="has"/> improved the investment climate in Latvia .

' European money ' , as we commonly <unk w="know"/> European Union structural funds , has contributed significantly to the development of Latvia 's economy .

Free travel in the Schengen area has become so customary and self-evident ; it <unk w="has"/> become so natural to learn , work <unk w="and"/> gain experience in other European Union Member <unk w="states"/> .

For us in a country with a small internal market , <unk w="which"/> is particularly important .

We can be proud that we have at our disposal such a <unk w="common"/> mechanism of collaboration .

It allows all of us to search together for active solutions to global challenges , climate and demographic change , the reinforcement <unk w="of"/> energy security , the problems of migration , and in the case <unk w="of"/> financial crisis , on a worldwide scale .

Latvia now has at its disposal new political and economic <unk w="development"/> , but it must be noted <unk w="that"/> our nation 's responsibility for the common future of Europe , a responsibility <unk w="for"/> all the people of Europe , has also <unk w="been"/> increased .

Looking back at our achievements , we must also be critical and own up <unk w="the"/> mistakes that have been committed .

After accession to the European Union , the Latvian government lapsed into a <unk w="series"/> of a ' job well done ' ; it had achieved its goal .

The European Union offers great opportunities , but each nation and each society must grasp <unk w="it"/> by itself .

We in Latvia have not grasped all the opportunities ; we have not always wisely implemented cohesion policy or made <unk w="out"/> of the financial <unk w="objectives"/> we have been offered .

We have not been sufficiently <unk w="happy"/> to adopt the euro ; that is one of the greatest mistakes we have <unk w="made"/> in the euro integration process , something that is acutely evident today in the circumstances of the financial crisis .

Is there anyone who wants to return to a world where there are restrictions on the free movement <unk w="of"/> workers , on their <unk w="side"/> and on their gaining experience ?

Even Eurosceptics <unk w="cannot"/> get used to good <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , and become simply sceptics .

Ladies and gentlemen , the deterioration of the situation within the financial system and economy in recent months has irreversibly changed the role and <unk w="coordination"/> of national governments within economic processes .

What we can see from this global crisis , however , is that our financial systems and our economies are suffering from that market , and most <unk w=","/> of all , real people are suffering from the crisis .

Late enough to still espy the obstacle - <unk w="the"/> financial morass - on the road ahead of us , but no longer able to avoid it .

At the global level , coordinated <unk w="measures"/> to <unk w="ensure"/> economic growth is essential .

That will only be possible by designing a new <unk w="perspective"/> and mechanisms for the financial system .

The <unk w="very"/> difficult challenge <unk w="would"/> be to strike precisely <unk w="this"/> balance .

At the European level , we have a <unk w="good"/> advantage , for we <unk w="must"/> implement coordinated measures , <unk w="including"/> united action and achieve a sustainable solution .

It is an important step out of the morass in which we find ourselves at <unk w="the"/> time .

There is a school of thought which suggests <unk w="that"/> Latvia is currently undergoing one of the most dramatic rescue operations of any financial system in modern European history .

Currently , Latvia is working on measures <unk w="to"/> stimulate the economy in order to stabilise the financial and economic situation swiftly <unk w="and"/> effectively .

It <unk w="is"/> a difficult task , but we shall succeed in overcoming the crisis only by seeing a clear way out of it , and not by mistaking short-term solutions for a long-term <unk w="lack"/> of economic development .

<unk w="at"/> the end of last year , six political parties represented in the Latvian parliament , from both government and opposition , agreed on a common stance of support for the <unk w="overall"/> stabilisation plan drawn up by the Latvian government .

The plan defines <unk w="the"/> medium-term priorities for Latvia 's economy : support for exports , the promotion of free and fair competition , a significant reduction in the current-account deficit in the balance of payments , and the introduction of the euro in 2012 .

Accession to <unk w="the"/> euro area has become one of our nation 's <unk w="most"/> important strategic goals .

We are being helped to overcome this <unk w="sad"/> time not only by international financial organisations but also by the institutions of the European <unk w="union"/> and by the nations of Europe .

Ladies and gentlemen , each enlargement has not only brought the European Union new Member States , but it has also introduced new accents into its agenda , including its <unk w="foreign"/> policy .

Latvia 's accession to the European Union took place at a time <unk w="for"/> Europe 's Neighbourhood Policy , its goals , principles and implementation mechanisms , were being drawn up .

<unk w="france"/> has always seen neighbourhood relations in a wider dimension .

Latvia will continue to play an active part in the <unk w="management"/> and implementation of this policy in the future .

This policy is not just a matter of the European Union 's relations with particular states , that <unk w="is"/> , with those states with which it shares a land or maritime border .

In the context <unk w="of"/> this policy , we <unk w="must"/> address the European <unk w="union"/> 's place and role in the world .

A new political initiative , the ' Eastern Partnership ' has come about , whose mission is to reshape Europe 's common neighbourhood policy and adapt it to the <unk w="specific"/> characteristics of this region , thereby making this process more active , more courageous and more ambitious .

In its practical work , the <unk w="accession"/> Partnership must strengthen the political and economic <unk w="dialogue"/> between the European Union and the states in this region , <unk w="will"/> also strengthen the mutual cooperation between those states .

In developing <unk w="the"/> Eastern Partnership , attention must be paid <unk w="to"/> the differentiation principle , individual assessment and the attitude towards each of the partners .

There are those states who wish to see themselves in the European Union , and there are those states that have <unk w="two"/> other goals for themselves .

Our policy will succeed only if we are able <unk w="to"/> work together with all the states of this <unk w="process"/> , helping with understanding where necessary .

Latvia will continue to be an active supporter of Europe 's Neighbourhood <unk w=","/> and play an active part in implementing it .

<unk w="the"/> European nation has its own experience of history and its own <unk w="efforts"/> to work on our common project for the benefit of the European Union .

Latvia 's particular contribution to the eastern dimension is the <unk w="political"/> trust demonstrated by our bilateral relations , which are rooted in a shared period in history , and <unk w="the"/> expertise born out of that trust .

Latvia 's duty is to make <unk w="use"/> of this special circumstance which <unk w="will"/> be lost within the next 10 years .

Making use of these advantages , Latvia will maintain <unk w="an"/> active political dialogue in order to encourage a better understanding of the European Union and its values in the <unk w="member"/> states and so clarify the goals of the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Eastern Partnership .

I am convinced that Europe 's interests would be best served by an early inauguration of the Eastern <unk w="mediterranean"/> during the Czech Republic 's Presidency .

Ladies and gentlemen , the question of energy security <unk w="has"/> very <unk w="much"/> become topical during the <unk w="early"/> days of the Czech Presidency .

<unk w="the"/> financial and economic crisis is cyclical in its own <unk w="way"/> .

The recent events in Ukraine and <unk w="the"/> conflict in Georgia <unk w="is"/> proof of this .

The events of the last year in the energy sector , the interruptions to energy supply , the <unk w="use"/> of energy resources and price volatility have helped to create a common understanding in <unk w="the"/> Union Member States of the need for a common energy policy .

At <unk w="the"/> intersection of energy and politics , our main task is <unk w="to"/> secure a regular , sufficient , economic , sustainable and environmentally friendly energy supply .

<unk w="on"/> some issues , of which the development of an environmentally friendly energy <unk w="market"/> is an example , we have adopted ambitious goals at the European level , which we must now begin to achieve .

On other issues - diversification of energy sources at European level and creation of a single energy market - we <unk w="are"/> right at the beginning of our journey .

The events of the last <unk w="few"/> days , <unk w="as"/> a cut-off of gas supplies from Russia , has opened eyes to <unk w="the"/> need to find the quickest possible solution at pan-European level .

<unk w="all"/> of us have the responsibility of applying this common understanding to create a truly integrated and diversified European energy market .

<unk w="the"/> initiative to improve energy security and solidarity also includes the development of the interconnection plan for the Baltic energy market .

Sweden will shortly have the opportunity to put it into practice during its presidency in the second half of <unk w="the"/> year .

Ladies and gentlemen , the initial aim of the European Union - the security and wellbeing of the people of <unk w="europe"/> - has not altered .

The <unk w="irish"/> economy is much more closely linked than it was half a century ago .

At the same <unk w="time"/> , powerful new economic players have appeared on the world scene .

It <unk w="is"/> only with <unk w="you"/> , far-sighted <unk w="fact"/> , most <unk w="part"/> of <unk w="all"/> , common action by the European Union that we can hope not to be the losers in this global competitive struggle .

Only together can we fulfil the promises of security and wellbeing <unk w="for"/> our citizens .

The European <unk w="union"/> has already <unk w="stated"/> that it has a broad vision of the future of <unk w="the"/> European Union .

Europe <unk w="'s"/> dynamic growth has given Europe the opportunity to compete globally .

This growth is Europe 's <unk w="railways"/> , which it must exploit , so that <unk w="the"/> Union can , even several decades from now , be an equal economic partner for the rapidly growing Asian <unk w="and"/> Latin <unk w="american"/> economies .

It is you yourselves in particular , as the democratically elected representatives of Europe 's nations , who feel the responsibility <unk w="of"/> this process most acutely .

It is also impossible to overestimate the significance of the European Parliament <unk w="in"/> bringing the European project nearer to our people and extending its democratic <unk w="deficit"/> .

In <unk w="the"/> future , the <unk w="role"/> of the European Parliament <unk w="has"/> become even more important .

It is important to unite <unk w="all"/> our multiformity and diversity .

<unk w="the"/> Lisbon Treaty is the legal precondition <unk w="for"/> the future fully effective functioning of the European Union .

Only by putting the principles of the Lisbon Treaty into practice shall we <unk w="be"/> able fully to realise <unk w="the"/> positive potential that the new , united Europe offers .

We can no <unk w="longer"/> consider and perceive ourselves separately from Europe .

For their part , Europe 's goals are attainable if they correspond to the <unk w="laws"/> of every Member <unk w="state"/> .

Only public discussion can tease out those values that are common to <unk w="all"/> of us .

<unk w="so"/> in unison can we agree on <unk w="the"/> values that we are going to place alongside those <unk w="countries"/> which the European Union was founded .

It is the task of all <unk w="this"/> , but especially <unk w="in"/> Europe 's leaders , to define European values and initiate discussion on them .

How do I <unk w="think"/> the European Union and Latvia in the longer term ?

The post-crisis economic world will have coalesced into <unk w="its"/> economic power centres .

Europe will have the will and the ability to be united , for only union will afford <unk w="them"/> the chance <unk w="to"/> fulfil our tasks .

Moreover , the European <unk w="union"/> will <unk w="also"/> be open to all those Europeans who accept its values .

The European Union will have expanded , but <unk w="we"/> will not lose the capability of effective action .

The European Union will <unk w="be"/> able to look after its own security and provide <unk w="for"/> stability in its neighbours .

Education and culture will be <unk w="a"/> bridge joining the different experiences of the European <unk w="union"/> 's Member States and that will help to regain Europe 's leading role in the world in the realms of <unk w="democracy"/> and culture .

<unk w="it"/> will no longer be old and new , small and large European nations .

<unk w="in"/> Europe , nations will be judged according to their achievements , not by geographical and geopolitical criteria .

Europe will be united , and this unity will be secured by powerful regions , which while defending their own interests will <unk w="work"/> closely together with others , thereby creating a network of wellbeing and development throughout Europe .

Every <unk w="pensioner"/> will contribute to this development according to its own abilities and <unk w="their"/> knowledge .

Latvia 's economy will be more balanced , more <unk w="efficient"/> and structurally transformed .

In 2015 , for the first time in <unk w="the"/> history of the independent state , Latvia will be entrusted with solving questions on the <unk w="european"/> and global scale as <unk w="a"/> presiding Member State of the European Union .

Our contribution to Europe will be our special relationships with <unk w="the"/> Eastern Partnership nations .

Latvia and our region <unk w="will"/> be the bridge to the East , just as the Mediterranean states will join both shores <unk w="of"/> that sea .

Our vision <unk w="is"/> an open Europe and our experience of integration will be the spur to Europe <unk w="'s"/> openness .

It will <unk w="be"/> more powerful in its economy , welfare and mutual cooperation .

Europeans will be proud <unk w="that"/> they live in Europe and yet belong to their own nation .

Unity in diversity , development , preservation of values and every citizen 's responsibility towards his <unk w="or"/> her nation and <unk w="in"/> the European family as a whole , that is Europe 's future .

Ladies and gentlemen , Europe 's development and prosperity is the yardstick of our <unk w="future"/> .

I call on you , <unk w="the"/> Members of the European Parliament , to encourage Europeans ' understanding of our common goals and of how they will affect the life of every European in his or her own home .

Mr President , may I thank you on behalf of the <unk w="european"/> Parliament for your address , for your European courageousness and for your European determination .

I still remember <unk w="very"/> clearly that , during accession negotiations in the second half of the 1990s , Latvia , Lithuania and Slovakia were initially excluded .

As a result , Latvia , Lithuania and Slovakia were able to <unk w="become"/> members of the European Union on 1 May 2004 .

You <unk w="asked"/> the energy question and I shall reply to you very briefly .

I should like to thank <unk w="mr"/> Piebalgs for his work in the presence of his President .

Mr <unk w="president"/> , my closing remark <unk w="is"/> this : you spoke about how you are learning and Latvia is learning .

Yet even those who belonged to the European <unk w="union"/> , to the European Union , from the beginning are learning from you and your historical experiences .

If we are prepared to <unk w="listen"/> to each other and to learn from each other , then we shall all be the better for it .

The restrictions on spraying by aircraft will surely be welcomed by EU citizens , as will the <unk w="best"/> zones for protecting drinking water and aquatic organisms .

I voted for the directive <unk w="and"/> it is in line with my views on <unk w="consumer"/> protection .

I think the <unk w="only"/> problem is that there <unk w="are"/> such <unk w="competition"/> rules across Member States : some countries apply training and education of operators in a very strict way and , therefore , have good sustainable use of <unk w="transport"/> , but not all countries do so .

I think this piece of <unk w="legislation"/> will make it appropriate <unk w="that"/> we have higher standards across the European Union .

<unk w="it"/> is good both for <unk w="people"/> who operate sprays and for those who come into contact with them .

I think we are talking about a very sensible package here , so I <unk w="am"/> very <unk w="much"/> to support it , and I congratulate the rapporteur .

The Kla√ü <unk w="also"/> extends the range of controls and limits the use of PPPs to essential use .

I supported the new regulation because in my opinion it constitutes a tool for pursuing new <unk w=","/> safer alternatives for protecting plants .

The preparation of a list <unk w="of"/> banned substances is also a step <unk w="forward"/> - these include carcinogens , genotoxic substances and also <unk w=","/> with neurotoxic and immunotoxic effects - and <unk w="are"/> based on scientific <unk w="evidence"/> .

As the <unk w="commissioner"/> said yesterday , <unk w="it"/> seems that it applies to a relatively small percentage of the substances still used today .

These reports have already been used for <unk w="political"/> purposes or they have already been debated here , so I believe they will be adopted in their written form .

Since I was a child there <unk w="has"/> been one vegetable that I hate : peas .

I agree with the aims of the legislation to promote the health <unk w="of"/> our environment , the health of us as individuals , but it really potentially threatens a huge agricultural industry <unk w="in"/> my region .

After much soul-searching , I have abstained , but I wish to make it clear that I think our legislative procedure in this respect was <unk w="made"/> .

We had so much information at the end - conflicting and otherwise - that I , and I think many others , would have welcomed the possibility <unk w="of"/> a third reading , or of conciliation , to make sure that we have protected <unk w="their"/> interests .

I <unk w="believe"/> that the report was , in general , very well-balanced and constructive , and it was certainly designed to <unk w="guarantee"/> a high level of protection for human health , animal health and the environment .

However , I have concerns about the situation where we <unk w="are"/> making decisions for approval of a particular substance based on whether that substance is a hazard or not , and we are not taking possible exposure into account .

I think we need impact assessments <unk w="attached"/> on a scientific basis .

One of my concerns is that , when I talk to citizens <unk w="of"/> the EU , one of the issues <unk w="which"/> constantly raise with me is that , at times , the EU 's legislation is not always proportionate .

<unk w="however"/> , there is <unk w="a"/> precautionary principle , <unk w="but"/> we need to be mindful of this , but decisions also need to be <unk w="made"/> , and I <unk w="would"/> have liked a little more evidence in this matter .

Whilst I welcome the <unk w="view"/> of <unk w="the"/> Breyer report to reduce red tape , I am not able to support this .

I have <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> with a number of experts and farmers <unk w="'"/> NFU representatives in my West Midlands constituency who all have deep reservations about the <unk w="fact"/> that this report will have on crop yields .

My biggest worry is <unk w="that"/> there has not been a proper impact assessment by the Commission and there is no clear indication of what this report will mean for agriculture .

That is why my delegation introduced an <unk w="opportunity"/> for a thorough and long overdue impact assessment .

While Diana Wallis was concerned about peas , you can imagine that , in Ireland , potatoes were certainly on our menu and <unk w="on"/> the agenda .

<unk w="unfortunately"/> , however , I believe that what we voted on is a much better <unk w="percentage"/> and package than the original one on the table - and I compliment those who worked on it .

I think we are now in a <unk w="situation"/> where farmers need to lobby the <unk w="chemical"/> industry to produce safer alternatives so that they can continue to produce <unk w="results"/> , and I think as much energy should go into that lobby as has gone heretofore .

Madam President , I voted against this simply because the proposal has been hijacked in effect by the Committee on the <unk w="environment"/> , Public Health and Food Safety and Commissioners .

The rapporteurs yesterday boasted <unk w="the"/> standardisation , and yet this is allegedly a Union of diversity .

If there were one area <unk w="of"/> judgement , discretion and diversity are needed , it is <unk w="worth"/> this .

The reason , of course , is because of a conflict of interests since the Danes fail to process their drinking <unk w="water"/> after it comes out of the ground .

Farmers in my part <unk w=","/> the world feel <unk w="to"/> let down and frankly insulted by the fact that there are some assumptions here that they do not know what <unk w="we"/> are doing , and they need to be told .

Madam President , exaggerated claims have <unk w="been"/> made and fears <unk w="raised"/> by all sides on this report .

It is has been difficult to distinguish fact from fiction and to come to a decision <unk w="on"/> how to vote .

I <unk w="welcome"/> the improvements made were worth our support , even though I still have some concerns .

I <unk w="commend"/> the vote as , in my opinion , the worst of all outcomes would be to deliver <unk w="this"/> report to conciliation .

<unk w="this"/> five-year derogation , renewable if necessary for essential plant protection projects , is an important safety net and also encourages the agrochemical industry to research and produce alternatives .

We talk about democracy , yet we ignore the <unk w="political"/> will as expressed in referenda <unk w="in"/> France , <unk w="the"/> Netherlands and Ireland .

We talk about food security , yet we vote on a report which has the potential to <unk w="improve"/> food production in <unk w="the"/> European Union .

We talk about helping citizens and farmers in poorer countries , yet there <unk w="must"/> now be , as a result of this vote , a call to ban imports from farmers who have used pesticides that are <unk w="now"/> banned in the European Union .

I agree with Mrs Wallis about the legislative process and that there should <unk w="have"/> been a third reading .

I will explain why by reading out a letter to me from James Mowbray , who <unk w="was"/> a farmer near Skegness in my region .

He said , ' I have personally been involved in the application of crop <unk w="of"/> products for over 40 years .

I therefore find it distressing that the possible withdrawal of many products , including the triazole <unk w="agreement"/> , is based on less than scientific arguments and will make <unk w="more"/> business not particularly viable and reduce the availability <unk w="of"/> home-produced food ' .

I received these <unk w="assurances"/> from him and from literally hundreds of other people , from Empire <unk w="to"/> Trade , based in Spalding in Lincolnshire , John Manby in Parker Farms in Leicester , John Clark , who is based in Nottinghamshire , Jonathan Reading and hundreds more names .

Madam President , now that this vote is over and <unk w="the"/> arguments have been made , I would like to come back to something that ran through the debate here and in the committee .

I would urge you to renew our faith in our farmers , who are doing their best to feed us in very difficult situations , circumstances <unk w="of"/> weather , pest and , of course , EU policy .

in writing . - We <unk w="have"/> just voted on an agreement for civil aviation safety .

Since the horrendous terror attack on the twin towers , innumerable security <unk w="that"/> have been put in <unk w="practice"/> .

Just like the issue of safety one can <unk w="possibly"/> be too secure .

Indeed , it is when we feel too secure <unk w="the"/> terror strikes <unk w="us"/> .

Of <unk w="course"/> , one has to find a balance between civil liberties and <unk w="political"/> and security measures ; however , when <unk w="it"/> comes down to a choice one has <unk w="to"/> prioritise .

For instance , there has been a <unk w="great"/> deal of opposition to the sharing of passenger lists on the basis of data protection .

In such an environment surely we are not expecting these countries to abstain <unk w="from"/> doing all that which is possible to protect the interests of its citizens .

I voted in favour <unk w="of"/> this report because the aviation industry in Romania will benefit directly too .

The negotiated agreement reflects by and large the structure of a conventional aviation safety agreement ; it is based on mutual trust in each other 's systems and on <unk w="the"/> comparison of regulatory differences .

However , the means of achieving this <unk w="objective"/> , namely cooperation and mutual acceptance of each other 's <unk w="outstanding"/> findings in the areas of airworthiness and maintenance , are set out in the annexes to the agreement , unlike in conventional agreements , where these measures are usually set out in separate non-binding agreements at civil aviation authority level .

The annexes broadly reflect the content of the Community 's Implementing Rules <unk w="for"/> airworthiness ( Commission Regulation <unk w="no"/> 1702 / 2003 ) and maintenance ( Commission Regulation No 2042 / 2003 ) to be modified by the parties based on a decision of the Bilateral Oversight Board .

The origins <unk w="of"/> the aviation agreements between the European Community and the United States ( US ) lie in and are based on the liberalisation of air transport .

As in other resolutions previously adopted by the European Parliament , we would highlight that we are obviously the first to be interested in <unk w="developing"/> a ' high level of civil aviation safety ' and measures ' to minimize economic burdens on the aviation industry and operators from redundant <unk w="or"/> oversight ' .

<unk w="however"/> , we must safeguard two important aspects : ( 1 ) the objective and presumed basis of <unk w="these"/> processes must not be to create and facilitate the conditions for increasing the liberalisation of air transport , through the harmonisation of <unk w="ships"/> ; ( 2 ) <unk w="and"/> processes must not promote harmonisation through a lowering <unk w="of"/> safety standards and rules , in <unk w="countries"/> where , when safety , minimisation of burdens and liberalisation are mixed together , it is profit <unk w="and"/> concentration that prevail .

We believe that air transport must be defended as a public service , provided by public companies <unk w="in"/> each country , which guarantee quality and safety in the services provided <unk w="by"/> citizens .

I agree in principle with Paolo <unk w="commission"/> 's <unk w="report"/> on civil aviation .

It <unk w="is"/> important for the EU and the US to agree on a common line with the help of this agreement .

However , it is vital in this overseas partnership that <unk w="we"/> are real partners , not just on paper .

In <unk w="any"/> event <unk w="of"/> contempt on the part of either the EU or the US , a rescindable variation in the agreement will <unk w="be"/> indispensable .

I voted in favour of the report on <unk w="the"/> proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of an Agreement between the European Community and the United States of America on cooperation <unk w="in"/> the regulation of civil aviation safety .

I think that the objectives of the agreement , namely facilitation of trade in the goods and services covered by the agreement , maximum limitation of the duplication of <unk w="analysis"/> , tests and controls to significant regulatory differences and use of the certification system of either party to check conformity with the requirements of the other party are legitimate objectives .

I hope that the reliance on mutual trust of the other party 's systems will favour the <unk w="signing"/> of this agreement .

As the European Parliament 's rapporteur for the legislative report on the expansion of the European Aviation Safety Agency <unk w="("/> ( <unk w="b"/> ) powers , I welcome the negotiated agreement with the United States on facilitating mutual acceptance of civil <unk w="aviation"/> safety certificates .

This agreement marks an important step in expanding transatlantic cooperation , which <unk w="is"/> a priority objective of the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats .

The agreement offers enhanced guarantees as regards safety and reinforcement of the compatibility of products , components and aircraft with the increased demands of protecting the <unk w="environment"/> .

In these conditions , we can hope that the European Single Sky principles will be extended in <unk w="the"/> future to apply to transatlantic cooperation and that cooperation will be widened in the field of research , as well <unk w="as"/> the implementation of new technologies in this field , based on collaboration between SESAR and NextGen .

I believe that this agreement will facilitate in the long term the mutually beneficial extension of the cooperation framework between the EASA and the FAA , from which airlines , the aviation industry and , more significantly , <unk w="consumers"/> will directly benefit .

As a result , one of the fundamental points <unk w="of"/> this cooperation agreement on the regulation of civil aviation <unk w="safety"/> is mutual trust in each other 's systems and <unk w="a"/> comparison of regulatory differences .

The objective of this agreement <unk w="is"/> to facilitate trade in goods <unk w="and"/> services in the aviation sector , by limiting as much as possible the duplication of assessments , tests and controls to significant regulatory differences between the two parties .

We therefore believe that a framework is being created which will work smoothly on a daily basis <unk w=","/> which will allow technical issues arising from its implementation to be solved through a system of continual cooperation and consultation .

This agreement is another fundamental <unk w="step"/> in the external dimension of the European transport policy , which is why I voted in favour <unk w="of"/> this report .

Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to state that I voted in favour of Mr Costa 's report on the conclusion of the agreement between the European Community and the United States of America on cooperation in the regulation of civil aviation safety , as set out <unk w="in"/> the proposal for a Council decision .

I concur with the rapporteur in considering that Parliament must declare itself in favour of the conclusion of the agreement because this would clearly streamline the trade in goods and services between the parties in the airworthiness and maintenance sector , avoiding the redundant duplication of assessments and checks on compliance with safety requirements , which until now have had to be repeated even if <unk w="they"/> are very similar to one another .

I believe , however , that the agreement should be applied provisionally at first , so that we can identify any practical and implementation difficulties and remove them before proceeding to <unk w="their"/> approval .

I voted <unk w="in"/> favour of this report for better legal regulation of companies within the EU .

I voted in favour of the report on the common system of taxation applicable to mergers , divisions , partial divisions , transfers of assets and exchanges of shares concerning companies of different Member States as these legal transactions result in fundamental changes to commercial companies ' legal <unk w="uncertainty"/> .

The European <unk w="union"/> also needs to take the necessary measures to <unk w="ensure"/> uniform , harmonised but effective regulation .

I also supported it because I am a lawyer and I will continue to support <unk w="all"/> the European <unk w="union"/> every effort made to harmonise and <unk w="protection"/> at <unk w="european"/> level <unk w="and"/> , <unk w="secondly"/> , civil and criminal regulations .

I voted in favour of this <unk w="report"/> as the Rules of Procedure of the Court of First Instance lack any provision as to the <unk w="changes"/> required to <unk w="be"/> used in appeal proceedings ( against decisions of the Civil Service Tribunal ) .

Madam President , following <unk w="the"/> last armed conflict in the Balkans , European states made widely differing statements on the subject .

However , by <unk w="the"/> active engagement in the situation which existed , the EU confirmed that the Balkans are an important region for us and are an integral part of Europe .

Furthermore , it is <unk w="clear"/> that the report underlines the need <unk w="to"/> establish a common energy policy .

The role of the EU as a major partner for the area in maintaining trade and economic relations while pushing for a stable , lasting peace in the <unk w="region"/> is a very important one .

The EU 's strength as an economic partner , but also as a model for a strong civil society , government and dynamic institutions , should be used to <unk w="compensate"/> for the development of the region .

A threefold and differentiated approach , taking into account the relative differences between countries in the region as well as association agreements and further support , provides a clear way to address issues of <unk w="groundwater"/> and shore up intensive regional and international economic <unk w="organisations"/> .

I know the Belder report only <unk w="deals"/> with the economic and commercial relationships with the <unk w="western"/> Balkans and the evident need for the European Union to assist in their reconstruction , in the economic , legal , political and social fields .

I am surprised , though , that , despite the statement that <unk w="humanitarian"/> aid , as well <unk w="as"/> the accession processes , must be differentiated and <unk w="extended"/> to each country , the report <unk w="does"/> not really take into account the specific situation of each country .

Above all , this Parliament , always quick to condemn violations of human rights around the world <unk w=","/> to demand ' human rights ' clauses in international cooperation agreements , has achieved the master <unk w="criterion"/> of voting for a report on the Balkans without once mentioning the dramatic and inadmissible situation of the Serb populations in Kosovo , who have become pariahs in the historical land of their fathers .

The consolidation of economic relations with the Western Balkans is of immense <unk w="gratitude"/> both to the EU and to the Western Balkans .

I therefore welcome the fact that <unk w="the"/> European Parliament is working intensively on this issue and that we adopted the Belder <unk w="report"/> today .

It is in the interests of the <unk w="eu"/> to champion the creation of political stability , legal security and hence good framework <unk w="conditions"/> in these countries for foreign <unk w="policy"/> .

The Belder report underlines the fact that the level of economic relations <unk w="and"/> on progress in each individual country .

Moreover , it should be the EU 's objective to diversify the national economies of the countries <unk w="of"/> the Western Balkans .

I am convinced that a positive development in economic relations between the EU and the Western Balkans <unk w="will"/> be of benefit to all countries on the <unk w="part"/> of Europe and I await the implementation of <unk w="its"/> proposals with anticipation .

<unk w="mr"/> President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of the report by Mr Belder on trade <unk w="and"/> economic relations with the Western Balkans .

I <unk w="agree"/> with my fellow Member in considering that the European Union has a vital part to play in the process of economic <unk w="and"/> political revival <unk w="between"/> countries in the Western Balkan area , <unk w="with"/> a view to their membership of the European Union , firstly in terms of stabilising <unk w="and"/> political situation and secondly in economic and trade <unk w="areas"/> .

I would nevertheless like to emphasise the need for the Union to conduct an in-depth analysis of <unk w="the"/> situation with regard to respect for human <unk w="rights"/> and democratic <unk w="principles"/> within each country .

I refer in particular to Croatia and the numerous Italian expatriates who continue to be clearly discriminated against in that country , despite Croatia 's official application for admission <unk w="to"/> the EU .

This aspect is , in my opinion , at odds with the situation of Serbia , a <unk w="country"/> that has only been granted the status of potential candidate and to which the Union should be more open than it has been <unk w="done"/> now .

I voted for <unk w="the"/> report on trade and economic relations with the Western Balkans as the motion for a European Parliament resolution also includes the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and that <unk w="of"/> the Committee on Regional Development of which I am a member .

At the <unk w="same"/> time , linking the economic and trade policies of the countries <unk w="of"/> the Western Balkans to the European <unk w="union"/> 's policy will support the <unk w="agreements"/> and <unk w="cooperation"/> agreements signed between the EU and these countries .

I voted in favour <unk w="of"/> this report because economic stability may <unk w="well"/> lead to political stability in this area , <unk w="which"/> has been particularly troubled over the years .

The EU <unk w="must"/> use all available means in order to motivate the Western Balkans region and persuade it to carry out essential reforms .

<unk w="the"/> Balkans have already made huge advances on the road to <unk w="deal"/> with the <unk w="commission"/> , but the prospect of accession will most certainly encourage states to continue their efforts at integration with the Community .

Therefore the introduction of <unk w="quotas"/> , which should be as far-reaching as possible and which would make the movement of <unk w="information"/> easier , is very important , as also is broad support for the region 's young people .

Only if the people of the Balkans feel that they have equal rights with the other citizens of <unk w="europe"/> will we be able to say that <unk w="we"/> have achieved success .

It is true that the level of development and adoption of the acquis <unk w=","/> is not <unk w="the"/> same in all the countries of that region , and so , in defiance of having a single strategy , it is necessary to choose specific approaches , which must be tailored to the needs in question .

The progress of the accession negotiations ( or their opening in the case of potential candidate countries ) with the Western Balkan states should , <unk w="therefore"/> , depend on full compliance with the Copenhagen criteria and unconditional respect for the principles of <unk w="democracy"/> and human rights .

However , it <unk w="has"/> undertaken an enormous responsibility with regard to the whole of the Western Balkans .

The <unk w="commission"/> has become the main trading partner of all <unk w="the"/> countries in the Western Balkans .

The three <unk w="most"/> important pillars of this cooperation are : stabilisation agreements , trade preferences , and technical and financial support .

In undertaking its actions , however , the EU must bear in mind the <unk w="importance"/> of some of the countries in the <unk w="region"/> and the status of the others as potential candidates for membership .

It is difficult not to agree with the rapporteur that a <unk w="good"/> condition for development of <unk w="third"/> countries under discussion is membership of the World Trade Organization ( Croatia , Albania and the former Yugoslavia are already members ) .

in writing . - ( SV ) The report on the common agricultural <unk w="policy"/> and global food security discusses important issues such as the consequences <unk w="of"/> rising food prices in poor and rich countries and the importance of securing access to food for everyone .

This challenge will continue to grow as the world 's <unk w="future"/> expands .

The current population growth <unk w="inflation"/> is over 70 million per year .

The EU is the largest giver <unk w="of"/> ODA and is a model for international cooperation , and can put this experience to good use globally .

The EU <unk w="cannot"/> afford to follow policy lines that are narrow in scope .

Just as international fortunes are intertwined , there is more and <unk w="more"/> overlap between policy areas .

This report is an acknowledgment of this and a recognition that the EU 's high standards and wealth <unk w="of"/> agricultural experience can be of a wider value in addressing global food security , including by providing funding for fertilisers and high-yield seeds , as well as training <unk w="and"/> practical support for farmers and food producers .

in writing . - ( DA ) Anne E. Jensen and Niels <unk w="we"/> have voted in favour of <unk w="mr"/> McGuinness 's own-initiative report on the common agricultural policy and global food security , as the majority of the report is excellent and it is only possible to vote either in <unk w="favour"/> or against .

We are strong supporters of free trade and believe that it is absolutely right <unk w="to"/> work to bring about a <unk w="situation"/> in which trade in agricultural products is based on free market principles .

in writing . - ( DA ) The Danish Members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have <unk w="voted"/> against the own-initiative report on the common agricultural policy and global food security , as the report opposes the liberalisation of agricultural policy and criticises EU rules on the restriction of pesticides .

The global food problem is increasing rather than shrinking and affects all grassroots classes , not only in <unk w="the"/> less developed countries , but also in <unk w="the"/> more developed countries .

The main cause of <unk w="the"/> situation is that the basic criterion for the production of agricultural produce and food is profit rather than global food requirements .

The trading of foodstuffs on international exchanges has resulted in spiralling price increases and , hence , <unk w="the"/> profits <unk w="from"/> the food multinationals , a perceptible reduction in rural output and global <unk w="capital"/> reserves and an increase in the number of malnourished people .

It barely touches on the principles of food sovereignty and security and the right to <unk w="live"/> in food .

The <unk w="meps"/> from the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report because , despite its findings and ' wishes ' , it <unk w="is"/> the anti-grassroots , pro-monopoly policy which is condemning more and <unk w="more"/> people to malnourishment and starvation .

In this respect , I welcome the content <unk w="of"/> Mrs McGuinness 's own-initiative report on the common agricultural policy and global food security .

I have , nevertheless , chosen to abstain , because the report was strongly <unk w="opposed"/> in places .

Subsidising and regulating our domestic agriculture does not promote our <unk w="establishment"/> of an open , green , safe and enterprising EU .

We are seeing this now <unk w="in"/> large parts of Africa , in particular .

We agree with various aspects highlighted by the <unk w="commission"/> , in particular :

the fact that the policy shift has resulted in a loss of potential market opportunities for EU producers and has led to increased <unk w="pressure"/> on imported food from outside the European Union , produced to very different production standards , thereby placing EU agricultural products at a disadvantage ;

the concern that dramatic increases in agricultural production <unk w="levels"/> may result in less usage and reduced output , which <unk w="would"/> exacerbate the food <unk w="situation"/> in Europe and the world ;

the need for policy instruments aimed <unk w="at"/> averting such large and damaging price fluctuations ;

<unk w="the"/> concern <unk w="is"/> increasing market concentration in the <unk w="large"/> retail sector , which has led to the development of <unk w="transport"/> , and the need for alternative solutions in negotiations with retailers , in favour of small farmers .

the increased orientation of the common agricultural policy <unk w="in"/> the market and the devaluation of food sovereignty , with the emphasis solely being placed on <unk w="social"/> security , forgetting that this is difficult <unk w="for"/> food sovereignty .

The McGuinness report tackles an issue that I <unk w="see"/> as strategic : food security and the <unk w="dignity"/> of strong and competitive European agriculture in a globalised world .

Following the <unk w="bse"/> crisis in food prices , food security should be <unk w="the"/> EU priority .

Despite the fact that another food shortage crisis is not foreseeable in the short term , it is likely that one will occur in the future , if we take into account the negative effects of climate change on agricultural production and the constantly increasing <unk w="costs"/> .

Bearing in mind that developing <unk w="countries"/> will probably not be able to produce food in sufficient <unk w="time"/> to supply their increasing populations , the industrialised countries will continue to have the important task of producing and exporting food .

The common agricultural <unk w="policy"/> must therefore once again become a European priority and form the basis of the European food security policy , given <unk w="that"/> , in a time of financial and economic crisis , it is more important than ever .

The VVD delegation would have liked to have seen the report clearly stipulate <unk w="that"/> the barriers to trade in the developing world should be phased <unk w="out"/> with reciprocity .

Alongside this , it would have liked the report to have argued in favour of a special , faster procedure for <unk w="the"/> authorisation of cisgenic products .

In <unk w="the"/> years world food prices have increased by over 80 % and <unk w="fish"/> stocks have fallen to <unk w="very"/> low levels .

Pressure on global food stocks are also coming from relatively new sources such as the move towards increased <unk w="freedom"/> of bio-fuels .

I welcome the <unk w="main"/> thrust of this report and , accordingly , voted in favour .

This crisis actually began before the present global economic crisis , at a time <unk w="around"/> world maize and wheat prices skyrocketed in a <unk w="relatively"/> short time .

The <unk w="bse"/> crisis may have changed its name to economic crisis , but the former has unfortunately not gone away .

Food security - access to a sufficient , safe and nutritious food <unk w="production"/> - must now become a key political priority both here and elsewhere .

We cannot tolerate a situation where , while worldwide famine increases and the price of food soars , we in Europe are winding down agriculture drastically and for the oddest <unk w="of"/> reasons .

In Finland , as in the other Member States , <unk w="we"/> must have the right to engage in profitable agriculture both now and in the future .

There is <unk w="an"/> unquestionable need to protect these people 's jobs during these times of food and economic crisis .

in writing . - ( SV ) It is interesting to note that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has not chosen to include in its report a key issue proposed by the Committee on Development , which reads : ' the <unk w="european"/> Parliament calls on <unk w="the"/> Council and the Commission , in close consultation with the ACP countries , to give priority to the question of the impact <unk w="of"/> the ACP countries of EU subsidies <unk w="for"/> the export of EU <unk w="tobacco"/> products and to commit to <unk w="the"/> specific , sustainable responses aimed at avoiding dumping , in compliance <unk w="with"/> the commitments made in this area . '

However , in the report it is claimed <unk w="that"/> the EU has addressed the potentially trade-distorting <unk w="nature"/> of EU agricultural policy that can negatively impact <unk w="on"/> farmers in the developing world .

The report complains that non-EU countries produce food to very different production standards , thereby exposing EU agricultural products to unequal terms of <unk w="competition"/> .

If this were the case , could the Committee <unk w="on"/> Development 's proposal not also be included in the text of the report ?

The report is also against reductions in <unk w="interest"/> payments within agriculture and is opposed to any reform of the common agricultural policy .

The recent extraordinary surge in food prices rightly prompted a discussion on agricultural policies , <unk w="social"/> security and development .

Regrettably , <unk w="the"/> issue of international trade is often missing from such debates , thus leading to the search for solutions which ignore the positive potential that increased world <unk w="trade"/> can have .

Although <unk w="only"/> this food price inflation poses a threat of famine for countries and populations without resources , and demands increased humanitarian aid , it <unk w="is"/> stimulates a global increase in food production capacity <unk w="is"/> a rise in global trade .

This is an opportunity for the agricultural populations of the world , of which <unk w="their"/> advantage must be taken .

The medium- and long-term profitability <unk w="of"/> European agriculture and rural <unk w="development"/> should be the criteria used in the <unk w="common"/> agricultural policy and its reform .

This report <unk w="is"/> more like a defence of the current common agricultural policy than a comprehensive overview of food security in a starving world .

I <unk w="believe"/> that the report paid little attention to the risks of land being bought up in the world 's poorest countries for growing and exporting the cheapest possible food to the rest of the world , at the expense of the economic development and needs of local populations in countries suffering from chronic food shortages .

Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of the report by Mrs <unk w="lucas"/> on the common agricultural policy and global food security .

I wish to emphasise that our efforts must <unk w="be"/> viewed from a medium- to long-term perspective and not focused merely on the short term .

It will not be enough <unk w="to"/> earmark substantial funding for poor and developing countries unless this is backed by a serious commitment by industrialised countries to ward off the speculation on the prices of staple foods that we <unk w="have"/> seen recently and introduce <unk w="new"/> agreements that take into account the very varied <unk w="number"/> of countries that belong to the World Trade Organization .

Otherwise the negotiations , which have already broken down , will continue to have little likelihood of <unk w="interest"/> .

We must make sure <unk w="that"/> we <unk w="play"/> our part in the EU ensuring that the hungry across the world are fed .

It <unk w="is"/> a disgrace that there are people in this world starving to death due to our lack of political coordination .

The purpose of the common agricultural policy is not only to increase agricultural productivity and ensure rational development of farming production through <unk w="the"/> use of production factors , especially the workforce , but also to provide rural populations with a suitable standard <unk w="of"/> living , guarantee security of supplies and ensure reasonable prices for supplies to consumers .

It is disturbing that food prices are higher than in previous <unk w="years"/> , and world food stocks have fallen to a critically low level .

There is a danger that <unk w="the"/> world financial crisis may induce developed countries not to honour their obligations in the <unk w="area"/> of aid to <unk w="third"/> countries .

Medium- and long-term action is needed to safeguard world food production and to support those <unk w="people"/> who are most seriously affected in terms of basic nutritional needs .

The greatest challenge now is to develop a policy for <unk w="production"/> and food which will meet <unk w="the"/> needs of the increasingly numerous world population , which , according to estimates , by the year 2050 will have grown by 40 % , while world food demand is expected <unk w="to"/> double in the same period .

This is of fundamental importance in terms of safeguarding <unk w="food"/> production .

If the market is <unk w="not"/> able to ensure this , it should be done through appropriate policy .

in writing . - The Labour delegation will be voting in favour of the CAP and Global Food <unk w="aid"/> report , despite the strong reservations we have on the stance taken on the <unk w="subject"/> .

We do not <unk w="agree"/> with the prominent role attributed to the CAP in ensuring food security nor with the criticism of the CAP reform , which has seen a shift away from quantity to quality production , the implication being that <unk w="it"/> has undermined our food security .

Our position is that we need to modernise our agricultural policy , and not return to a production-based policy that encouraged massive over-production <unk w="on"/> a distortion of markets , <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="interests"/> of other countries to produce and trade agricultural goods .

We do , however , feel that the report raises many very important points on the issue of global food security , such as recognising the importance of food security as a key political priority for the <unk w="commission"/> , urging for greater cooperation on a global level , calling for more investment in developing countries to build up their production capacities , and urging for agriculture to be placed at the <unk w="heart"/> of the EU 's development agenda .

All of these points are equally important and demand that we look beyond <unk w="the"/> narrow focus of those using this issue as justification for a more interventionist and protectionist CAP and that we support the report .

However , we would like to make it clear that we believe it to be wrong <unk w="for"/> churches and religious communities to be <unk w="given"/> a special status among civil society organisations .

However , care should <unk w="be"/> taken to ensure that the proposed initiative <unk w="is"/> not by its own momentum transformed into another <unk w="country"/> .

I endorsed the report because every step taken to bring citizens closer to the authorities which make <unk w="sense"/> for them is a step towards a better and more transparent democracy .

However , I want to emphasise that , as is the case in <unk w="the"/> dialogue , so <unk w="that"/> in the one concerning the Lisbon Treaty the opinion of every party should <unk w="be"/> taken into account .

In case you had forgotten : the Lisbon treaty <unk w="is"/> sunk by <unk w="the"/> democratic will <unk w="of"/> the people of Ireland .

In voting the way they did , <unk w="the"/> people of <unk w="colombia"/> also spoke for the citizens of every other Member State , including my own , who were denied a referendum by their governments .

Ireland has been bullied into holding a second vote , but the Irish people are unlikely to take kindly to being treated with such <unk w="problems"/> .

In future , we should avoid bringing ourselves into disrepute by discussing hypothetical <unk w="issues"/> such as the Lisbon treaty .

It merely serves to expose the <unk w="consumer"/> 's arrogant disregard for democratic opinion .

The cursed Treaty of Lisbon , <unk w="this"/> is simply an airbrushed version of the Constitution , suffered <unk w="by"/> the same fate , rejected , as it was , in a democratic referendum <unk w="with"/> the Irish people .

Europe , however , refuses to accept the opinion of the people and wants to ram the Constitution down the throats of Europeans through the backdoor , pretending that everything in the garden is rosy and talking of a so-called ' dialogue with <unk w="every"/> citizen in the framework <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="completion"/> of Lisbon ' with the greatest cynicism .

This is supposed to be a ' dialogue with the citizen ' , ' a strong <unk w="sense"/> of <unk w="democracy"/> and <unk w="the"/> ' , whereby the rapporteur , in her cynicism , quotes once more Article 10 of the Treaty on European Union : ' Every citizen shall have the right to participate in the democratic life of the Union ' .

This may be true , but Europe does not take any notice of <unk w="the"/> democratic voice of the people .

<unk w="in"/> writing . - This report by Genowefa Grabowska provides for <unk w="the"/> mechanisms of participation and for vehicles for civil dialogue within the European Union .

It addresses the gap between members of the <unk w="union"/> and the <unk w="government"/> they have with the institutions that serve them .

For <unk w="this"/> report , Ms Grabowska highlights both transparency and representativeness as essential components of active civil dialogue and a genuine participatory democracy .

A more open <unk w="and"/> accessible Council , increased and more integrated inter-institutional cooperation , better use of new media as a means to connect with citizens and providing assistance to civil society institutions will help bring Europe closer together .

in writing . - We support any and all efforts to empower citizens , communities and civil society <unk w=","/> with regard to political decision-making processes , including the EU .

Furthermore we believe that for <unk w="the"/> proposed Citizens Initiative to be meaningful , the Commission should be under a legally binding obligation to produce a White Paper outlining a response to the proposal , or the Treaty <unk w=","/> for not taking action .

This report is yet another one which goes against the majority of the European Parliament in its efforts to try and ' sell ' the Treaty of Lisbon project at any cost , a task which has not proved easy , judging by the results <unk w="of"/> previous referendums .

<unk w="that"/> propaganda exists - and this is the <unk w="essence"/> of the report - which can disguise the anti-democratic nature of the insistence by the EU 's leaders on forcing another referendum in Ireland in order to impose this proposed Treaty .

We do not share the narrow view of those who consider that developing a ' civil dialogue ' or a ' citizens ' initiative ' is sufficient to counteract the nature of a proposal which , as a whole , prevents the citizens of each Member State from defining their <unk w="own"/> future , and which insists on measures resulting in precarious jobs , increased working hours , <unk w="collective"/> redundancies and the privatisation of public services .

No <unk w="point"/> exists <unk w="and"/> can conceal the neoliberal , federalist and militarist content of this Treaty project .

Mrs Grabrowska 's report recommends permanent dialogue between all the European institutions and the ' representatives ' from civil society to <unk w="economic"/> policies and draw up legislation at EU level , in other words a formal , compulsory organisation of participatory ' democracy ' at Union <unk w="level"/> .

The trouble is , participatory ' democracy ' is merely a front for those who reject true democracy : it allows dialogue <unk w="to"/> be restricted to the most active organisations , which are rarely the most representative , and it appears to test citizens ' views in advance , the better to be able to refuse to <unk w="tackle"/> them properly later on .

If the Europe of Brussels wishes to hear the citizens , let it take note of the French and Dutch ' no ' to the European Constitution and abandon the Treaty of Lisbon , which <unk w="is"/> a mere copy of the Constitution .

If opinion polls ought to be taken into account , as the rapporteur would like , <unk w="is"/> a <unk w="view"/> to the negotiations for Turkey 's membership , because the majority of Europe 's citizens oppose it .

If it is right to respect the principle that decisions should <unk w="be"/> taken as close as possible to the citizens , <unk w="that"/> Europe cease to rule over our daily lives .

Then it would have <unk w="any"/> credibility when it spoke of democracy .

in writing . - ( SV ) I <unk w="voted"/> in favour of the report by Mrs Grabowska on the perspectives for developing civil dialogue under the Treaty of Lisbon .

I believe that it is important to strengthen the dialogue with civil society in order to create an EU that listens to and represents the views <unk w="of"/> its citizens .

I also agree with the demands in the report for work <unk w="and"/> the Council to be more open in order to enable civil society to participate in the dialogue in a meaningful way .

However , I believe that the inclusion of the Treaty of Lisbon was unnecessary , as it is no longer relevant after the Irish ' <unk w="s"/> ' vote in the referendum .

<unk w="it"/> is also wrong for churches and religious communities to be given a special status <unk w="to"/> civil society organisations .

I agree with the report on the perspectives for developing civil <unk w="society"/> under the Treaty of Lisbon .

I consider civil dialogue to be <unk w="so"/> important , so that the citizens of the EU can gain an insight into the areas of activity of their elected representatives .

I should like to highlight the comment that dialogue between the EU and the Union citizens should be a two-way dialogue , because it is not enough to inform our home countries <unk w="in"/> the implementation of projects ; we also have to <unk w="go"/> to individual people and take their opinion seriously .

<unk w="this"/> was rejected by the voters of Ireland in a referendum and therefore must be considered dead .

What was , essentially , the same draft treaty had already been rejected in referendums in France and the <unk w="netherlands"/> .

However , the European Parliament 's federalist majority is unwilling to <unk w="take"/> , insisting , instead , on a Union that <unk w="is"/> governed to an even greater extent at the supranational level , despite the fact that its <unk w="representatives"/> have shown their <unk w="interest"/> in multiple referendums and that , given the chance , they would show this scepticism in even more countries , too .

The way of <unk w="enlargement"/> demonstrated by the European Parliament 's federalist majority shows what sort of a civil dialogue it is that they want .

<unk w="i"/> only want to listen to those parts of civil society that fit into the federalist mould .

Outside the legislative procedure , the report we have before us is not <unk w="completely"/> impressive .

Paragraph 9 of <unk w="the"/> report states that all EU institutions should <unk w="ensure"/> up-to-date registers of all <unk w="the"/> non-governmental organisations .

Furthermore , paragraph 11 of the report talks about promoting an ' actively European mindset ' <unk w="for"/> EU citizens .

This proposal is <unk w="a"/> another step towards constructing an EU state .

Despite all the camouflage manoeuvres , the people <unk w="have"/> understood full well that a treaty that <unk w="represents"/> 95 % in keeping with the rejected EU Constitution is no Columbus 's egg , even if the EU establishment is trying to market <unk w=","/> as such .

It is also interesting , given that we want to conduct this dialogue in all the languages , that we are not even in a position to <unk w="ensure"/> that the President-in-Office of the Council has an integrated website in the most widely spoken languages <unk w="in"/> the Union , namely English , French and German .

We must also look particularly ridiculous to our <unk w="ambitions"/> in praising the new civil initiatives provided for in the Constitution as a step towards more democracy , given that referendums are being repeated until the result wanted by the EU is obtained .

As this initiative can only be yet another pure pro-EU-Constitution <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , <unk w="but"/> which enough money has already been spent , I voted against the Grabowska report .

I voted in favour of this report as civil society plays an important role in Europe in the European integration process , by passing on the opinions and requests of EU citizens to Europe <unk w="'s"/> institutions .

The report also highlights the importance of the expertise which <unk w="information"/> society makes available to institutions and emphasises the role and significance of functions for informing and raising awareness involved in civil dialogue .

I hope that the EU 's current initiatives , which promote greater involvement by civil society in the European <unk w="decision-making"/> process , will continue <unk w="in"/> the future as well .

I am referring <unk w="in"/> this instance to initiatives such as Europe by Satellite , Citizens ' <unk w="rights"/> and other citizen <unk w="depends"/> on various topics .

I hope that this report will encourage the <unk w="european"/> Union 's Council to facilitate and simplify access to its proceedings , as this is a basic condition for initiating a proper dialogue with civil society .

Ladies <unk w="and"/> gentlemen , I welcome the fact that the report draws <unk w="attention"/> to the need for social dialogue at a time when European countries are experiencing a democratic crisis .

The low <unk w="rate"/> in European elections is a logical consequence of the fact that European citizens do not know what positive contribution European legislation can make to them and they do not believe their vote can have any influence .

I agree with Mrs <unk w="peijs"/> that the Member States should provide more fundamental support to non-governmental organisations .

I also take the view that the <unk w="information"/> campaign for the European Parliament provides a great opportunity for responsible MEPs to explain what decisions we make in Strasbourg , how civil society participates in our work and how it will be able to participate following adoption of the Lisbon Treaty .

The success of dialogue depends on representativeness , and therefore on the strong commitment of key <unk w="principles"/> .

National , regional and local authorities should use the method of dialogue , so that citizens can experience participatory democracy <unk w="and"/> in practice .

The citizens of the <unk w="union"/> must be sure that no decisions at European level will be made without their involvement , and that by voting in elections they will have a real influence on the form of those decisions .

<unk w="it"/> so lays us wide open to accusations of arrogance and contempt for the democratic process , which must still be concluded one way or another .

<unk w="however"/> , I am not in favour of EU funds being spent on promoting the Lisbon treaty <unk w=","/> civil dialogue or <unk w="any"/> other means .

We have <unk w="the"/> media and vigorous democracies in the Member States and are quite capable of conducting this debate on our own terms without the Commission trying to influence matters .

I , like other British Conservatives , <unk w="like"/> to see the European Union going in a different direction by doing less and doing it better .

The <unk w="staes"/> report is yet another example of the scandalous way <unk w="in"/> which this Parliament handles the principles it claims to serve .

' Dialogue with the citizen in the framework of the Treaty <unk w="of"/> Lisbon ' : what a joke !

The Treaty of Lisbon , which is the ex-European Constitution in disguise , was consigned to the waste paper bin in referendums in the Netherlands <unk w=","/> in France , and subsequently also in Ireland .

If the outcome of a referendum is not to <unk w="be"/> liking of the Eurocratic nomenclatures , this does not necessarily mean that the voting public is lacking in brain cells .

The European authorities must be open to dialogue and cooperation with the citizens and <unk w="the"/> organisations from civil <unk w="society"/> .

However , particular interest <unk w="may"/> , lobbies that do not represent <unk w="a"/> common good , should not be allowed to infiltrate the legislative process under the guise of a dialogue <unk w="with"/> civil society .

I insist that dialogue should be <unk w="compatible"/> with associations that give a voice to the poorest <unk w="citizens"/> and families .

The EU is anti-democratic and undemocratic and is <unk w="therefore"/> a legitimate guardian of anyone 's rights .

The <unk w="objective"/> of creating a blacklist of unfair commercial practices , not only for business-to-consumer relations but also for business-to-business relations , is laudable .

I also support the mechanisms for monitoring and enforcement <unk w="in"/> the implementation of legal regulations in the area <unk w="of"/> consumer protection concerning unfair practices , and I support the initiative to <unk w="make"/> a publicly accessible database of national measures adopted in transposition of <unk w="the"/> Directive concerning unfair commercial practices .

The first is that the European legislation on these <unk w="issues"/> is presented as a directive , in other words the Member States are relatively <unk w="involved"/> in the resources they implement to achieve the objectives assigned to them .

The rapporteur 's <unk w="proposals"/> for uniformity , both in the substance and in the form of national legislation , will <unk w="be"/> a wish unless there is unacceptable interference by the European Union in the legal and administrative systems of the Member States , with no real benefit to consumers .

The second is that the main added value that the European Union brings to <unk w="these"/> areas is the help in resolving cross-border disputes .

This issue has <unk w="not"/> been properly resolved either in the current applicable texts or in those called for .

The main objective of this <unk w="directive"/> should not be to exist per se but to protect consumers and companies .

The Directive concerning unfair commercial practices and the Directive concerning misleading and comparative advertising have immense significance in terms of giving consumers more confidence and ensuring legal <unk w="certainty"/> for businesses in the internal market .

This has <unk w="enormous"/> significance in relation to cross-border transactions , which are increasingly common in the European market .

National consumer protection authorities are <unk w="of"/> encountering difficulties in <unk w="taking"/> appropriate action in the target country in the case of such transactions .

Proper transposition , implementation and enforcement of these directives are essential for achieving <unk w="the"/> goals of the directives .

In 2007 the European Commission used for the first time the ' EU Sweep ' as a tool <unk w="in"/> check and enforce the implementation of <unk w="community"/> protection legislation as regards airline websites .

Irregularities were confirmed on as many as 43.6 % of the websites reviewed , which only confirms the necessity of <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> monitoring in relation to the enforcement <unk w="of"/> existing provisions .

I welcome the Commission 's initiative concerning the creation of a publicly accessible database of <unk w="the"/> measures adopted in transposition of these directives .

It is disappointing that some Member States have yet to transpose the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive ; and this House has today sent a clear message that those <unk w="member"/> States should address this shortcoming .

<unk w="we"/> adopted an EU directive protecting consumers from unfair commercial practices <unk w="and"/> misleading advertising back in <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> .

However , <unk w="we"/> still refuse to protect citizens from Internet callers , unwanted advertising calls and Scammer & Co .

Rip-off companies <unk w="left"/> behind post office boxes , front men and name-changing .

If you manage to catch any of <unk w="these"/> companies , they are sentenced to ridiculously <unk w="or"/> fines , which have no deterrent effect whatsoever .

<unk w="it"/> is <unk w="important"/> for customers who have been ripped off to be able to file a compensation claim , otherwise we are just hanging them out to dry .

The planned changes will improve the situation <unk w="of"/> consumers , which is why I voted in favour .

I welcome the debate on the report on the transposition , implementation and enforcement of Directive 2005 / 29 / EC concerning unfair business-to-consumer <unk w="trade"/> practices in the internal market and Directive 2006 / 114 / EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising .

While these directives form the backbone of consumer protection in the EU , they must be consistently <unk w="restricted"/> in the Member States , especially for Internet purchases .

The internal market must not be fragmented and businesses and consumers must come <unk w="down"/> the same rules and protection regardless of which Member State they are buying or selling in .

I must draw your attention to the <unk w="fact"/> that some Member States , including the Czech Republic , have been late in transposing the directives into their national legislation .

It is also necessary for European institutions to support greater cooperation between the national councils for radio and television broadcasting which have to monitor compliance with the directives <unk w=","/> the mass media and it is in our interest for the supervision to be applied consistently across the <unk w="european"/> EU .

<unk w="mr"/> President , ladies and gentlemen , I am voting in favour of Mrs Weiler 's report on the <unk w="subject"/> , <unk w="implementation"/> and enforcement of Directive 2005 / 29 / EC concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market and Directive 2006 / 114 / EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising .

I am firmly convinced that the proper implementation of the directive will make it possible for the public <unk w="to"/> be fully aware of their rights .

I agree with <unk w="the"/> rapporteur when she states that appropriate transposition , implementation and <unk w="implementation"/> of the Directives on unfair business-to-consumer <unk w="market"/> practices and on misleading and comparative advertising are of fundamental importance to the achievement of the aims <unk w="laid"/> down in the Directives , <unk w="particularly"/> in the light of the different application and implementation methods and systems used in the Member States , <unk w="the"/> complexity of some of the legal concepts contained in <unk w="these"/> Directives , the quantity and exhaustive nature of national standards governing unfair commercial practices and misleading advertising and also the extensive range <unk w="of"/> application of the Directive .

Lastly , I am delighted by my fellow Member 's initiative , the aim of which is the legal regulation of a topic <unk w="which"/> is of <unk w="utmost"/> importance to the Community .

I definitely <unk w="support"/> Barbara Weiler 's report on the <unk w="implementation"/> , implementation and enforcement of the Directive concerning unfair commercial practices in the internal market and the <unk w="information"/> concerning misleading and comparative advertising .

The issue of misleading and comparative advertising in business-to-business transactions has been regulated by the introduction <unk w="of"/> a single , consolidated directive .

The issue of unfair commercial practices in <unk w="our"/> relations has been regulated by Directive 2005 / 29 / EC .

The Directives were prepared to give consumers more confidence ( their protection has increased due to the <unk w="opening"/> up of a ' blacklist ' of commercial practices which should be prohibited , and thanks to better harmonisation of the protection of consumers against unfair practices ) and also to provide businesses with greater legal certainty .

The changes introduced must be supported by clear procedures for <unk w="concrete"/> and effective measures for redress , which will give consumers the right <unk w="to"/> bring claims for damages for losses incurred in connection with unfair commercial practices , like the mechanisms for monitoring consumer protection in relation to airline websites first used in 2007 .

At the Member <unk w="state"/> level <unk w="information"/> campaigns and campaigns which improve levels of consumer <unk w="protection"/> on <unk w="the"/> subject of consumer rights and their use should be considered .

in writing . - ( SV ) We Swedish Social Democrats <unk w="voted"/> against the report on the ecosystem approach to fisheries management .

We believe that the report does not make it clear that the fisheries policy must be <unk w="compatible"/> with environmental and sustainability criteria as the starting point .

In addition , the report focuses far too much on holding back on the necessary reforms of the fisheries policy and protects the interests <unk w="of"/> the large-scale fishing industry .

Summarised very briefly , this own-initiative report of the European Parliament aims to integrate the Community requirements for the <unk w="protection"/> of the marine environment with the common fisheries policy ( CFP ) , which has , as one of its operational objectives , the gradual application of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management .

The fundamental points of this report that I should like to highlight are the <unk w="fact"/> that it considers that the present system of total allowable catches and quotas does not serve the aims of <unk w="the"/> reformed CFP , having proven <unk w="respect"/> for both the Community fisheries <unk w="policy"/> and the conservation of stocks .

Alternative management systems should be quickly established and , against this backdrop , I consider that the EU should <unk w="be"/> swifter in discussing alternative approaches , <unk w="so"/> that some , such as management based on fishing rights ( for example ) , form the cornerstone in countries such as the United States , New Zealand , Norway and Iceland , all with a strong tradition and great potential in the fisheries sector .

Reformulating the recovery plan for <unk w="chemical"/> and lobster is another fundamental point which should be considered .

It will be particularly important to reaffirm and defend these objectives and principles ( as the Portuguese Communist Party ( PCP ) has consistently done ) , many of which are not respected by the common fisheries policy ( CFP ) ( even though some are included in it ) , when the European Commission announces the presentation , next April , of a green paper on the future of the common fisheries policy , indicating a possible reform of this policy by <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> .

Given the objectives and intentions which have been set out by the European Commission and other EU institutions on the future of the fishing industry , this sector in Portugal - which is in deep crisis , the <unk w="incidence"/> of which lie in the onerous policies followed for decades at national <unk w="and"/> Community level - should be alert to and should mobilise against new and even more onerous measures .

If adopted and applied , these would bring about the destruction of a large part of this strategic sector , with <unk w="the"/> consequences for Portugal .

The report correctly notes that EU fisheries policy should promote the modernisation and sustainable development of the fishing industry , safeguarding <unk w="the"/> socio-economic viability and the sustainability of fisheries resources , and guaranteeing the supply of fish to the public and <unk w="their"/> sovereignty and security , the <unk w="loss"/> of jobs and improved living conditions for fishermen .

This is <unk w="the"/> opposite of <unk w="what"/> the CFP has achieved over the last three decades , and accordingly I support the repatriation of fisheries management .

Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of <unk w="mr"/> Guerreiro 's report on the CFP ( common fisheries policy ) and the <unk w="european"/> approach to fisheries management .

It is of fundamental importance not to confuse sea <unk w="safety"/> ocean policy with fishing policy : I totally agree with the rapporteur on this score .

A fishing policy must be based on the principle <unk w="that"/> an interdependence exists between the wellbeing of the fishing community and the sustainability of <unk w="the"/> ecosystems of which they form an integral part , particularly by acknowledging the specific nature and importance of small-scale coastal fishing and <unk w="local"/> fishing .

I also agree with my fellow Member <unk w="when"/> he states that the main and paramount task of fisheries management , as an activity <unk w=","/> the exploitation of a renewable resource , is to control ( directly or indirectly ) the <unk w="local"/> fishing effort in order to guarantee the maximum sustainable catch .

If we adopt this approach , we will take a further step towards achieving the goals laid down <unk w="by"/> the European Union .

In this case also , the final compromise has ended up taking into <unk w="account"/> several of the <unk w="amendments"/> that we made about the initial proposal , specifically with regard to reduction indicators and targets , measures and timetables to <unk w="reduce"/> the risks and <unk w="problems"/> associated with pesticides and the dependency on pesticides .

In our opinion , it is more reasonable not to quantify these targets from the outset , so as not to create ever <unk w="more"/> obstacles to small-scale agriculture .

Incidentally , it should always be <unk w="said"/> that it was not family-based holdings and the non-intensive method of production which led to BSE , dioxins , <unk w="noise"/> and other food disasters ...

The entry into force of this directive will <unk w="be"/> extremely important in terms of increasing pressure for the urgent amendment <unk w="to"/> the pesticide risk reduction policy , which in the EU has been characterised by a <unk w="complete"/> lack of information and inspection of practices and products .

To protect human health and the environment , it is <unk w="important"/> to help change the approach to agricultural pesticides .

This document <unk w="is"/> fundamental because it lays down <unk w="restrictions"/> on informing and training people who use pesticides and requires the inspection of equipment .

It also prohibits aerial spraying ( permitted in cases of absolute necessity <unk w=","/> where there <unk w="are"/> no alternatives ) .

I abstained from voting on the ' pesticides package ' to protest against <unk w="the"/> anti-democratic method of submitting compromises to the European <unk w="union"/> negotiated in informal trialogues between the Council , the Commission and representatives of the European Parliament , which are based solely on compromises reached in a single parliamentary committee .

In fact , by dispensing with proper democratic debate during a first reading , not only is every Member 's right to make amendments removed but <unk w="it"/> also produces European legislation which is conceived in defiance of any democratic transparency .

Madam President , I consider the adopted reports on pesticides and plant protection products to <unk w="be"/> the best we could achieve , as well as realistic and fruitful , and <unk w="that"/> is why I gave them my support .

Although at the last moment in plenary some Members tabled amendments that they thought would have ensured that the legislation was founded on stronger scientific evidence , at the same time allowing the <unk w="lack"/> of derogations for individual Member States , it was clear to the majority that it would be audacious to start disregarding the outcome of negotiations between Parliament and the Council , even if the amendments were valid .

It was the report on the placing of plant protection products on the market that particularly aroused <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> . Differing national interests and approaches and the consensus that was absent in the Council were reflected <unk w="in"/> the mood of <unk w="parliament"/> .

Nevertheless , the feedback from stakeholders in the sector shows that the legislation is consistent and will enable the realisation of the EU-wide targets set for <unk w="measures"/> to improve and protect both <unk w="the"/> environment and public health .

Impact studies carried out by French technical institutes and centres show <unk w="that"/> the draft revision of the European directive on pesticides could lead <unk w="to"/> the disappearance of many products currently on the market .

It is important that this draft gives farmers in the Union the means to protect <unk w="their"/> crops .

Entire <unk w="economic"/> sectors could be condemned in France and in <unk w="particular"/> and the very role of agriculture , which is to feed our citizens with healthy and varied produce , would be threatened .

Without questioning the need to protect consumers and users , the new <unk w="states"/> must not threaten innovation or the diversity of chemical families .

This <unk w="is"/> the <unk w="only"/> solution <unk w="to"/> avoid the migration of a large amount of agricultural production and the jobs and wealth that go with it .

<unk w="but"/> with these crucial challenges <unk w="for"/> farmers , as the producers of vegetables , fruit and cereals , we need to remain <unk w="vigilant"/> in the face of the current reforms <unk w="of"/> the measures taken to apply them at national level .

They guarantee optimal use <unk w="of"/> farmland in Europe , <unk w="and"/> ensuring a high standard of food production .

I am , of course , satisfied that account has been taken of my resolution adopted in November , so that particular care must be taken when <unk w="the"/> pesticides which are toxic for bees to ensure that pesticides which are proven to harm bees are not licensed .

<unk w="the"/> objective is efficiency , which means as much as necessary and as little as possible .

A <unk w="substantial"/> reduction in the number of products would be insane .

Farmers need sufficient different products , if only to prevent resistance from building <unk w="them"/> .

I am delighted <unk w="that"/> Luxembourg now lies in the same zone as Belgium and Germany , with farmers and vine-growers <unk w=","/> to use the <unk w="best"/> products on either side of the border .

Madam President , ladies <unk w="and"/> gentlemen , I voted in favour of the report presented by Mrs Kla√ü on the framework directive for the sustainable use of pesticides .

I am fully in agreement with the adoption <unk w="of"/> the European Parliament and Council directive .

The aim of the directive is <unk w="to"/> reduce the impact of pesticides <unk w="on"/> human health and the environment : a quantitative reduction in pesticide use should therefore be one of the practical aims , to be achieved by specifically setting targets and implementing national action plans .

<unk w="there"/> must also be much more restrictive in order to fully protect public health .

I also believe that the labels placed on such products should be clear and comprehensible to all so that implications <unk w=","/> with the use <unk w="of"/> each <unk w="other"/> element are known .

Yesterday I mentioned during the debate that I consider the <unk w="nice"/> compromise to be an honourable one and that the Group of the <unk w="greens"/> / <unk w="european"/> Free Alliance in the European Parliament will be endorsing it .

I wish to stress , however , that , in order to reach agreement with the farming <unk w="community"/> and the pesticides industry , we had to make a few concessions .

As a result , everything is left to the <unk w="borders"/> of the individual Member States .

It is perfectly possible for Member States not to be too ambitious , which can lead <unk w="to"/> too much reserve .

In addition , the result achieved in relation to the <unk w="promotion"/> of buffer zones adjacent to waterways has been moderated .

This , <unk w="however"/> , is now being left to the Member States .

A European minimum distance would have been preferable from an <unk w="economic"/> and public health point of view .

What is positive , though , is that public places frequented by vulnerable groups ( parks , sports and recreational areas , schools and suchlike ) will be <unk w="fully"/> protected .

This area had <unk w="not"/> received attention in Flanders and is now set to receive attention <unk w="to"/> all the governments of Europe .

<unk w="in"/> writing . - This legislation has the EU written all over it - a classic case of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut .

Its effect on farmers and horticulture businesses in north-east England , the region I represent , will <unk w="be"/> considerable .

No-one disputes the importance of protecting the environment but <unk w="this"/> legislation is unbalanced .

The Commission has failed to carry out a sufficiently <unk w="integrated"/> and up-to-date impact assessment study .

<unk w="in"/> writing . - ( SV ) We have today voted in favour of Mrs Breyer 's report on the placing of plant protection products on the <unk w="ground"/> .

The regulation , which <unk w="aims"/> to improve both food safety and the impact on the environment of plant protection products , is sound and important .

Since its first reading in the European Parliament , analyses <unk w="has"/> shown there to be a risk of the regulation being extremely far-reaching and inflexible , and it may make the commercial-scale cultivation of common crops ( carrots and onions , for example ) impossible in Sweden .

The situation is not improved by the fact that <unk w="environmental"/> impact assessments of the rules differ in respect of important conclusions , for example between those of the <unk w="european"/> Chemicals Inspectorate and its British equivalent , the Pesticides Safety Directorate .

We regret the fact that <unk w="at"/> this second reading in Parliament there has been no opportunity to vote for clarification of this , but we would point <unk w="out"/> , at the same time , that the adopted text contains improvements on that from Parliament 's first reading .

We would have liked to have seen the agreement reached between the European Parliament and the Council taken into account , which would have the effect of clarifying the regulation so that dangerous use would be more clearly prohibited while plant protection that is necessary , responsible and safe - which is now at risk of being prohibited - would continue to be <unk w="done"/> .

The compromise that <unk w="has"/> finally been reached in the European Parliament represents a climbdown from the <unk w="commission"/> proposals that were made on the elimination of active substances , particularly from the <unk w="social"/> implications that these proposals would have had with regard to insecticides and pesticides .

This is particularly true in countries such as Portugal , which is seriously affected by certain insect pests on fruit and vegetable crops , potatoes and olives and by certain diseases such <unk w="as"/> pinewood nematode and chestnut blight , and where , not least due to the lack of effective plant protection campaigns , these pests and diseases are causing serious damage , particularly to <unk w="small"/> holdings .

Although we have many doubts about certain specific aspects of the compromise , such as the issues of non-chemical methods of control or prevention , and of pest and crop management , we feel it is correct to apply the principle of mutual recognition of plant protection product authorisations and the creation of zones encompassing regions with similar soil <unk w="and"/> climate characteristics .

However , we insist on the need for studies to give us a true picture of the consequences of these measures on productivity and , as a result , on farmers ' incomes , so that this cost can be shared by the <unk w="citizens"/> of society , given that we <unk w="are"/> talking about <unk w="food"/> and food safety requirements .

in writing . - I voted <unk w="for"/> the amendments to the Breyer report .

Nevertheless , the real impact is unclear with the failure <unk w="to"/> provide a satisfactory impact assessment on the proposal in its current form .

I therefore support the idea of a derogation post 2015 when <unk w="the"/> authorisations lapse in the event of any Member State having serious concerns about the availability of a pesticide having serious effects <unk w="on"/> crop yields .

I agree with the report adopted , particularly because the application of the principle of mutual recognition <unk w="and"/> plant protection product authorisations will end the competitive imbalances that exist between different Member States ( with different sizes of market ) <unk w=","/> will <unk w="help"/> reduce environmental <unk w="and"/> food safety concerns .

The issue of endocrine disrupting <unk w="which"/> has , in my view , a fundamental basis : the proposed text is based on scientific opinion .

The problem with endocrine disrupting substances is that , unlike carcinogens or mutagens , they do not have toxicological <unk w="control"/> , but produce a variety of effects ranging from <unk w="the"/> hormone imbalances to genital malformations and / or cancer .

In recent years <unk w="the"/> Union has constantly increased the limit values and a reduction was therefore long overdue .

That pesticides which are hugely harmful to health can finally be banned is progress , although there is still <unk w="far"/> too little research here .

<unk w="the"/> cumulative use of pesticides , which can be <unk w="used"/> to circumvent the limit values specified , still gives cause for concern .

<unk w="we"/> still know far too little about the possible interactions and legal specifications here are overdue .

The extent to which documentation <unk w="and"/> traceability are really <unk w="used"/> is open to doubt .

The meat scandals in recent years show quite clearly how easy <unk w="to"/> fraud is .

Last but not least there is still the problem that , although we may impose pesticide specifications on our producers and farmers , we <unk w="should"/> import products from countries with laxer requirements .

The Chinese toy episode should be a lesson to <unk w="us"/> .

in writing . - I <unk w="voted"/> against the conclusions and recommendations of the Trialogue between Council , Commission and Parliament because :

this legislation was to be passed in too much haste , because both Parliament and Commission finish their terms of <unk w="commitments"/> this coming summer which is not a sufficient reason to legislate in a hurry ;

the farmers whom I represent in Lincolnshire and in the East Midlands <unk w="who"/> asked me to resist the proposals , and being practical people who grow our food their opinions should be <unk w="done"/> .

Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of the report presented by Mrs Breyer on the placing of plant protection products on the <unk w="ground"/> .

I am also convinced that it is right to provide for experiments on animals to be kept <unk w="to"/> a minimum and carried out only in the event of <unk w="the"/> need and <unk w="for"/> the use of alternative methods to be promoted so that animals are spared needless suffering .

in <unk w="writing"/> . - I have decided to vote against this report for two reasons .

Firstly , we need to give our farmers the tools they need to do their job and this proposal will limit their ability greatly , especially for those farmers who work in damper and <unk w="the"/> climates <unk w="who"/> need to use pesticides to protect crops and their livelihood .

I am not aware of any farmer who <unk w="wants"/> to use pesticides , but they are an essential part of ensuring food for our population at an affordable price .

<unk w="however"/> , no impact assessment has <unk w="been"/> done on this legislation <unk w="and"/> I find outrageous due to the serious implications it could have on the agriculture sector .

Yesterday I mentioned during the debate that I consider the present compromise to be an <unk w="important"/> one and that the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance in the European Parliament will be endorsing it .

Whichever way you look at it , what was achieved in terms of the cut-off criteria is a watered-down result when compared <unk w="with"/> the EP 's position at first reading .

The idea <unk w="of"/> three zones across such a vast expanse strikes us as problematic because the environmental circumstances <unk w="are"/> any of those zones can vary enormously .

What is positive , though , is that the legal basis is founded on <unk w="access"/> , the <unk w="internal"/> market and public health , with the concern for public health being given top priority in the relevant recitals and in Article 1 .

Equally , the cut-off criteria for substances that have unacceptable effects <unk w="on"/> bees are a welcome <unk w="one"/> .

The requirement to replace dangerous products with safe alternatives more quickly was also complied <unk w="with"/> .

Whilst the outcome could <unk w="have"/> been better , we voted on an acceptable compromise .

I would prefer the common <unk w="position"/> as it would give a better balance <unk w="between"/> public health and food production .

Labour MEPs do wish to see better and safer pesticides , but we also have a responsibility to both producers and consumers <unk w="to"/> be sure what the eventual effects of the current proposals on agricultural production and food prices would be .

The emphasis <unk w="on"/> this legislation is clearly on health and the links between chemical substances and cancer .

While this package seeks to limit the availability <unk w="of"/> carcinogens , Member States may allow substances on the market where there is a serious threat to plant health .

<unk w="this"/> proposal seeks to protect bees and reduce red tape for substance authorisation .

With a gradual withdrawal <unk w="of"/> substances until 2016 , we would urge industry to come up with biologically sound and effective products .

Products will be banned based on hazard as opposed to scientific risk , which <unk w="can"/> be <unk w="focused"/> on use and exposure .

In addition , the definition of " endocrine disruptor ‚Äù has not been agreed at scientific level and we have tabled amendments <unk w="which"/> await <unk w="the"/> opinion of Commission experts to address this .

With this text limiting the production <unk w="and"/> sale of pesticides , and the accompanying text setting out the framework for their use , Europe <unk w="has"/> finally achieved exemplary standards <unk w="and"/> pesticides .

in writing . - The legislative regime for pan-European investment funds , Undertakings for <unk w="public"/> Investment in Transferable Securities ( UCITS ) , has been subject to a considerable review .

These are formed of collective investment schemes , which , having obtained an authorisation in a <unk w="member"/> State , are able to use this ' <unk w="country"/> ' across the Union without the need for further examination .

Wolf Klinz 's <unk w="report"/> proposes the introduction of ' passports ' for management companies ( MC ) which are engaged by UCITS fund promoters .

This proposal allows for the cross-border management of funds without the <unk w="straightforward"/> requisite for fully functioning management companies being set up .

It is vital <unk w="that"/> sufficient fund managers are available to maintain a proper watch on MC passports .

UCITS ( Undertakings for Collective Investment in <unk w="public"/> Securities ) <unk w=","/> a harmonised investment fund product that invest according to defined investment policies .

The UCITS framework Directive , to which the Klinz report refers , ensures cost transparency - and something which is particularly important at a time of economic and financial crisis in <unk w="the"/> EU - a high degree of investor protection .

The Directive sets basic requirements on the organisation , management and <unk w="management"/> of investment funds .

It is true that , in comparison with the <unk w="internal"/> market , European investment funds are characterised <unk w="by"/> their small size , a consequence of which are <unk w="the"/> high costs for investors .

The changes proposed by the rapporteur are primarily the introduction of new provisions concerning fund mergers ( so that they will be treated as domestic mergers and will retain tax-neutrality ) , the introduction of a document which provides key investor information ( replacing the simplified prospectus ) and simplification of the existing <unk w="codecision"/> procedure by using direct regulator-to-regulator information exchange .

in writing . - ( SV ) We support the report , as we believe that sustainable public finances are very <unk w="important"/> .

The report on public finances in the Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) adopts the anti-labour decisions made by the Council and the Commission which are designed to strengthen the competitiveness of monopolies in order <unk w="to"/> safeguard the profits of capital and shift the burden of <unk w="the"/> deep capitalist crisis onto the workers ' shoulders .

The anti-grassroots <unk w="is"/> shaped by the EU with the Stability Pact and the Lisbon Strategy for the Member States , especially those in the EMU , in order to <unk w="make"/> financial policy is being strengthened .

The European Parliament , like the Commission , is trying to contain the centrifugal trends and the logic of ' every man for himself ' by calling for <unk w="much"/> greater dedication <unk w="to"/> completing the internal market , harmonising taxes and strengthening competition and the rules of the market .

Criticism of the fact <unk w="that"/> the huge sums made available to deal with the crisis are not reaching small and medium-sized enterprises , let alone the workers , <unk w="are"/> misleading .

The outdated and failed models of <unk w="public"/> intervention to cover the shortcomings of the market are wishful thinking and an attempt to disorientate the workers by seeking social consent to a rotten system .

The only solution is for the workers to fight for grassroots power and a grassroots economy to <unk w="the"/> capitalist barbarity .

However , to tackle the crisis , it then fundamentally sets out the same recipes that led to the current situation , instead of taking advantage of this opportunity to propose changes to the neoliberal <unk w="regulations"/> monetarist <unk w="countries"/> that have contributed to the current serious social situation of increasing inequality , unemployment , precarious and poorly paid work , and poverty .

It therefore insists on price stability and the Stability and Growth Pact , albeit with a degree of flexibility , and on the Lisbon Strategy , <unk w="which"/> , as we know , has been used as a pretext in order to pursue privatisation and <unk w="share"/> responsibility for social functions from the state .

This <unk w="agreement"/> also involves the idea of the minimal state and the <unk w="energy"/> efficiency of the private sector , with the <unk w="aim"/> of imposing acceptance of so-called wage restraint , which actually results in a loss of purchasing power for wages .

What I take from Mrs Gottardi 's report on public finances is that it has learned no lessons <unk w="from"/> the world crisis .

Mrs Gottardi qualifies as ' market <unk w="economy"/> ' and ' insufficient supervision ' what is in reality the failure of a system which , for years , has been imposed upon us : that <unk w="is"/> deregulation , of extreme world-wide free market philosophy , of absurd financialisation of the economy , where the market rules and is supposedly self-regulating .

The crisis has <unk w="meant"/> that complete freedom of movement for goods , services , capital and people leads not to prosperity but to catastrophe .

<unk w="it"/> has also shown that the <unk w="debate"/> is the appropriate and effective <unk w="procedure"/> for decision , action and reaction , even if Mr Sarkozy felt he had to be accompanied everywhere by Mr Barroso to make people believe that the European Union was useful in this situation .

<unk w="in"/> this context , <unk w="the"/> rapporteur 's good advice on the management of public finances and her call for compliance with the Stability and Growth <unk w="pact"/> are , unfortunately , of little use .

However I abstained in the vote <unk w="because"/> of the report 's adherence to the flawed Lisbon Strategy , emphasis on competitiveness , support for flexicurity and the implicit threat to pension schemes , public health and long-term care under the guise of ' structural reform ' .

<unk w="humanitarian"/> features and biometrics in passports and travel documents ( debate )

The next item is the report by Mr Coelho , on behalf of the <unk w="committee"/> on Civil Liberties , <unk w="justice"/> and Home Affairs , on the proposal for a regulation of the <unk w="european"/> Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation ( EC ) No 2252 / 2004 on standards for security features and biometrics in passports and travel documents issued by Member States - C6-0359 / 2007 - .

Mr President , Mr Barrot , ladies and gentlemen , the proposal we are discussing today is aimed at changing the regulations approved in 2004 , which improved and harmonised the security <unk w="systems"/> relating to the protection of EU citizens ' passports and travel documents against fraudulent use , at the same time as it introduced elements of biometric identification .

Contrary to the procedure in 2004 , we are now in <unk w="force"/> .

I want to thank the French Presidency and Commissioner Barrot for the <unk w="positive"/> commitment they have made in this case with a view to reaching agreement at first reading .

I would also like to <unk w="thank"/> the shadow rapporteurs for their work and their cooperation , which have been indispensable in obtaining this result .

This solution was necessary , if we bear in mind that this regulation came into <unk w="force"/> in 2004 , and as from June this year at the latest , all the Member States would have <unk w="to"/> collect the fingerprints of children from birth .

However , according to the existing studies resulting from pilot projects conducted in several <unk w="member"/> States , it is very difficult to take or <unk w="to"/> rely on fingerprints of children under six <unk w="years"/> of age .

However , that would mean that up to the age limit for which that exemption was granted only temporary passports <unk w="can"/> be issued .

It would <unk w="be"/> an excessive burden for parents to have to obtain a passport for each of <unk w="the"/> children whenever they wanted to travel outside the Schengen area .

We therefore succeeded in reaching an agreement stipulating a period of four years during which the age limit <unk w="will"/> be set at 12 years , with an escape clause which should allow those States which <unk w="have"/> already adopted legislation enshrining a lower limit to apply this , provided that limit is not lower than six years .

A revision clause was also expected , taking into <unk w="account"/> the results of the study which we requested the Commission to carry out concerning the credibility of children 's fingerprints , stipulating that the age limit <unk w="should"/> be definitively set and harmonised for all the Member States in four years ' time .

The International Civil Aviation <unk w="organisation"/> 's ' one person-one passport ' recommendation was also accepted .

<unk w="these"/> respective initiatives should be introduced <unk w="by"/> the Commission within the framework of the respective <unk w="provisions"/> of civil law .

I must confess that we are struggling with the issue of <unk w="the"/> Union 's reduced competence in this <unk w="area"/> : the issuing of passports <unk w="became"/> a <unk w="large"/> prerogative and the European Union can only intervene with regard to the reinforcement of biometric <unk w="risks"/> in passports and travel documents , with the aim of improving the security of those documents within the framework of border control .

I have to say that we have established rules that safeguard the exercise of the Community competence , determining which types of data will be included - fingerprints and photographs - and also the limits on the <unk w="progress"/> that <unk w="can"/> be made of them .

We also reached <unk w="agreement"/> on two studies : one on the so-called ' <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> documents ' , to guarantee that the documents which <unk w="seek"/> passports to be issued deserve the same trust as <unk w="a"/> passport we want to safeguard , and <unk w="so"/> on data matching in <unk w="the"/> controls , in order to be able to study the false rejection rates .

As a result of these studies , <unk w="particularly"/> bearing in mind the four-year revision clause , at some point the necessary changes should be introduced through a codecision procedure , without forgetting that it is important to consult the <unk w="personal"/> Data Protection Supervisor , a rule which was unfortunately not taken into account when drafting this proposal .

The Commission proposal is to introduce harmonised exceptions to the requirement to collect fingerprints , so that all European citizens receive equal <unk w="rights"/> .

In addition , the Commission wanted to protect children <unk w="from"/> human trafficking by making the <unk w="legally"/> recognised principle of ' one person-one passport ' legally binding .

I welcome the European Parliament 's efforts to achieve an agreement on this proposal at first reading <unk w="on"/> the <unk w="abolition"/> of fingerprints in passports <unk w="transposed"/> by Member States by 28 <unk w="and"/> 2009 at the latest .

I , therefore , truly wish <unk w="to"/> express the Commission 's satisfaction with the negotiated compromise proposal .

Now the Commission will set about the task of the report requested and required by <unk w="the"/> European Parliament as efficiently as possible .

I do not think I need <unk w="to"/> go on further .

I will now listen with interest to the contributions from the Members and I again thank your rapporteur , Carlos Coelho , who has <unk w="done"/> an excellent job .

I believe there is an urgent need to <unk w="have"/> a common set of standards for the <unk w="protection"/> of biometric data .

Many countries require that the citizen applying for a passport actually present him or <unk w="not"/> in person , together with their documents and photographs , and in these cases the officials at the passport-issuing office can see if that person bears a resemblance to the photo presented .

However , <unk w="in"/> some countries - maybe most notably in the <unk w="united"/> Kingdom - applications by post are the norm , and the authenticity of the photo is only confirmed <unk w="in"/> a so-called ' professional person ' who has known the applicant for at least two years .

This verification can be made by your optician or your dentist , but also by a professional photographer <unk w=","/> a fire service official - no disrespect to members of these professions .

It is also interesting that <unk w="the"/> lax rules on verification exist in the United <unk w="states"/> .

<unk w="in"/> fact , this means the <unk w="debate"/> at the <unk w="new"/> post office .

So , in order to make passports secure , <unk w="we"/> really need to bring in <unk w="a"/> more reliable biometric data , namely fingerprints .

We also need to ensure that the agency responsible <unk w="for"/> their collection <unk w="and"/> verification complies with the same <unk w="rules"/> , <unk w="not"/> only within the EU but also in those nations whose citizens do enjoy visa-free travel <unk w="throughout"/> Europe , to assure us that they too are meeting the same <unk w="safety"/> requirements as are our citizens here in Europe .

Mr President , when the regulation on security features and the inclusion of biometric details in European passports was adopted in 2004 , the Member States <unk w="did"/> not envisage any derogation from the <unk w="commission"/> to provide fingerprints .

Current experience shows that the existing technology still does not ensure that the fingerprints of children under the age of 12 are reliable <unk w="and"/> to allow them to be used as a security feature in passports .

I therefore welcome the compromise found <unk w="by"/> the Member States to set 12 as the age limit for the collection of biometric data , and which includes a clause for revision in three years .

On our side , we have accepted this derogation for those Member States that have already adopted legislation for children over the <unk w="age"/> of <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> .

We remain , however , open <unk w="to"/> any positive changes in the technology in this field .

The inclusion of this data in passports gives a false sense of security as it does <unk w="to"/> prevent a child from crossing a border without parental consent .

The compromise <unk w="reached"/> with the Member States will <unk w="encourage"/> the Commission to present a report on the requirements for minors travelling <unk w="right"/> across external borders .

This report will thus allow initiatives to be proposed that will guarantee a European approach to the rules <unk w="of"/> minors when they cross external borders of the Member States .

Finally , the biometric data in passports must <unk w="therefore"/> be used to <unk w="improve"/> the authenticity of the document and the use of sensitive <unk w="sea"/> data such as biometric details is only acceptable in conjunction with strict data protection rules .

Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , firstly I wish to congratulate our rapporteur , Carlos Coelho , and the former French Presidency which , as expected , is not with us , for bringing about an agreement at first <unk w="reading"/> .

I have a special word <unk w="on"/> congratulation for Mr Coelho , our rapporteur , because his explanatory statement , which I invite my <unk w="friends"/> to read , is a little gem of intelligence and political skill .

Proper analysis of the text before us will <unk w="be"/> a major principle , which is also this report 's revolutionary principle .

This revolutionary principle has nothing to do <unk w="personal"/> biometric data .

Let <unk w="us"/> not hide the fact that the compromise was extremely difficult .

Some , like Mr Coelho at the <unk w="moment"/> , wanted this to be at the earliest possible age , to give children the earliest possible protection .

Yet this would require reliable <unk w="scientific"/> data , which at the moment cannot be guaranteed .

Finally , the following compromise has been achieved : children 's <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> are obligatory from the age of 12 .

Those States that collect them earlier may continue to do so for four years , but <unk w="in"/> no case will the age limit be less than six and the Commission will , in coming years , report <unk w="on"/> an assessment of the system as it <unk w="is"/> operating and , if need be , and this is included in the text , any modifications .

With this in mind , we can register our agreement with <unk w="the"/> text , which I again welcome , <unk w="and"/> I congratulate the rapporteur , the Commission for its initial proposal and the Council for its sense of compromise .

Mr President , <unk w="ladies"/> and gentlemen , I would <unk w="like"/> to start by congratulating the rapporteur on the excellent job he has done .

As the rapporteur for the EU strategy on the rights of <unk w="the"/> child , it falls to me to stress certain important points in Mr Coelho 's report , even though other fellow Members have already done so .

Secondly , the principle of ' one person-one passport ' is important , because it directly links the biometric data to <unk w="this"/> document holder .

This does away with all the procedures currently in use that allow for <unk w="jobs"/> to be added to their parents ' passports .

Thirdly , the report also <unk w="indicates"/> that the Commission will submit a <unk w="proposal"/> examining the technical feasibility of using fingerprints for <unk w="the"/> purposes of identifying <unk w=","/> under the age of 12 .

I will conclude by saying that in my opinion it will be extremely helpful in future <unk w="to"/> identify the <unk w="more"/> sophisticated , appropriate and safe technical methods to record and thus categorically certify the identity <unk w="and"/> age of a child as early as is feasible , from <unk w=","/> if possible .

on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Mr <unk w="president"/> , <unk w="commissioner"/> , I would like to thank Mr Coelho for his excellent work .

Although we all have different political <unk w="prisoners"/> , he did his best in order to achieve a compromise .

The Verts / ALE Group strongly <unk w="supports"/> the extensive introduction of biometrics until its necessity is proven <unk w="in"/> a reasonable doubt .

We believe that it <unk w="has"/> crucial implications for personal data <unk w="protection"/> and for fundamental rights .

Therefore , we are satisfied that the compromise with the Commission and the Council is achieved , the age limit of 12 years is established <unk w="in"/> those Member States where <unk w="millions"/> of children does not take place and the age limit <unk w="of"/> six years is established for other Member States .

I would <unk w="like"/> to stress once again that our support for age limits does <unk w="not"/> mean that we support fingerprinting as <unk w="well"/> .

We <unk w="also"/> believe that biometrics <unk w="'s"/> passports can be used <unk w=","/> for verifying the <unk w="contents"/> of the document or the identity of the holder .

Use of such data for other purposes , such <unk w="as"/> law enforcement , is neither legitimate nor proportional .

That is our position , but I would like to stress once more than we congratulate Mr Coelho and the Commission and Council on this <unk w="issue"/> .

Children must be exempted from the requirements to provide <unk w="for"/> fingerprints for passports .

There is still no secure knowledge <unk w="regarding"/> the use of biometric fingerprints from children under the age of 12 .

<unk w="it"/> is therefore disproportionate to collect and use data whose reliability cannot be guaranteed beyond all doubt .

The compromise which has now <unk w="been"/> found with the Council reflects these concerns and , thanks to Parliament <unk w="'s"/> insistence and thanks to the excellent work by the rapporteur , it is based on an age limit of 12 for a transitional period of four years , during which time a broad study will be carried out in <unk w="order"/> to investigate the reliability of children 's biometric data .

Unfortunately , the compromise also provides for exemptions for those Member States which already have laws allowing fingerprints to be taken from children under the age <unk w="of"/> 12 .

It is therefore even more important that we expressly establish during the course of the compromise reached that the European legal act on security features and biometric data in passports and travel documents cannot under any circumstances be used as grounds for appeal in order to set up databases containing these data <unk w="at"/> national level .

on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - <unk w="mr"/> President , I am very pleased to say that the UK is <unk w="missing"/> from this regulation because it is not part of the Schengen zone .

What kind <unk w="of"/> originating documents are used for the initial identification of <unk w="the"/> applicant , and how can it be sure that they are authentic ?

Once a passport has been issued , it is not of much use unless the data on it can be checked against the identity of the holder on <unk w="any"/> kind of national or centralised identity database .

The report acknowledges that <unk w="they"/> should be highly secure storage mediums for keeping such information , but we all know from experience in Britain that there is no such thing as a <unk w="very"/> secure medium for storing such data .

<unk w="in"/> fact the UK Passport Service 's biometrics enrolment trial in 2004 showed a failure rate of 1 in 3 for facial recognition , 1 in 5 <unk w=","/> fingerprints and 1 in 20 for iris scans .

Biometric identification <unk w="is"/> an attractive idea , but it is not the fail-safe mechanism we all might imagine .

( NL ) Mr President , in my opinion the rapporteur is quite right to draw attention to a number of points which largely arise from the fact <unk w="that"/> the collection , processing and comparison of biometric passport data are relatively <unk w="to"/> developments .

It is also of the utmost importance <unk w="that"/> we introduce a degree of harmonisation as regards the handling of biometric data , <unk w="in"/> a chain is no stronger than its weakest link .

In theory , the abolition of internal borders in the European Union should have resulted in improved supervision of <unk w="internal"/> borders , but in reality it is apparent that the <unk w="commission"/> continues to exhibit quite glaring vulnerable spots .

<unk w="these"/> criminal networks , drug and <unk w="criminal"/> traffickers and illegal immigrants have <unk w="vigorously"/> benefited from such vulnerable spots .

If we want a more efficient border supervision system , it <unk w="is"/> , in any case , high time that biometric data <unk w="is"/> an effective part of that system .

He has already succeeded in achieving a compromise with the Council and the Commission at first reading and I strongly <unk w="urge"/> that compromise , including the ' one person-one <unk w=","/> ' principle .

<unk w="finally"/> , I would like to explore this issue in a little more detail .

This principle should make it possible to offer greater protection against crimes such <unk w="as"/> child trafficking and child abduction , because every child should receive his or her own passport with a chip containing his or her biometric data .

This will certainly be the case in Member States which have <unk w="not"/> now allowed children to be included <unk w="in"/> their parents ' passports .

In <unk w="the"/> Netherlands , the maximum cost of a passport is upwards of EUR 48 <unk w="million"/> the cost of including a child on his or her parent 's passport is EUR 8.50 .

For a family with three children this will , therefore , result <unk w="in"/> a <unk w="reduction"/> of the cost of obtaining passports , <unk w="by"/> EUR 120 at present to more than EUR 240 .

Yet is it not <unk w="possible"/> that , if it is possible to <unk w="produce"/> a child , it is also possible to <unk w="take"/> hold of his or her passport ?

<unk w="if"/> the amended regulation is in place , it will no longer be possible to include children on their parents ' passports .

However , is <unk w="certainly"/> not the case that including a child on his or her parent 's passport in some <unk w="countries"/> actually serves the very interest of the child 's safety , as it indicates which parent has custody of the child ?

Within the next three years <unk w=","/> European <unk w="union"/> will have to review the need for an additional regulation , for example Community rules concerning the crossing of borders by children .

At present , Member States are still fairly divided on <unk w="this"/> issue .

I <unk w="call"/> on the Commission to use the <unk w="opportunity"/> to examine whether or not and how the introduction of a single passport <unk w="to"/> person has contributed to a decrease in the number of child abductions .

Has the current compromise produced the desired effect <unk w=","/> has it merely led to side effects which require resolution ?

Should it be in the child 's interest to take further steps in the medium term , you will certainly find the Christian Democrats in <unk w="this"/> House on your <unk w="opinion"/> .

( EL ) Mr President , the fact that Parliament 's view prevailed today over the Council 's attempts to introduce biometric data <unk w="protection"/> for six-year-old children is a <unk w="matter"/> for the fundamental principle that personal data can only be collected if it can be proven that it is necessary , proportionate and of course useful to do so , a principle which I fear the Council and <unk w="the"/> Commission have frequently ignored over recent years in their legislative initiatives .

In the case of children 's passports and fingerprints , obviously children need their own passports with biometric identifiers in an effort <unk w="to"/> prevent abductions , child pornography and trafficking in children .

As far as fingerprints are concerned , we have <unk w=","/> which show that they are barely of any use for six-year-old children .

<unk w="this"/> is demanding a serious study from the Commission in order to see when in fact children can be protected using their fingerprints , and will only allow them to be collected at ages at which we know for certain that this is the case .

Finally , in any case , as far as biometric identifiers in passports are concerned , we have said ' yes ' for the purpose of recognising the holder , ' yes ' <unk w="by"/> identifying the holder , ' yes ' for ascertaining that the passport has not been forged , but ' no ' to the creation of electronic data <unk w="protection"/> on <unk w="behalf"/> of innocent citizens .

( PL ) The introduction of passports bearing biometric identifiers of the holder is a response to appeals to engage <unk w="in"/> the fight against the falsification of documents , terrorism and illegal immigration .

<unk w="there"/> is , therefore , exceptionally important to ensure a high level of confidence <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="removal"/> of collection of biometric data and the creation of shared basic standards on collection of data , in a way which will ensure their security and credibility .

I <unk w="welcome"/> the rapporteur 's proposal for <unk w="an"/> analysis <unk w="to"/> be made of the differences between Member States in the area of documents <unk w="which"/> must be presented as grounds for the issue of a passport .

<unk w="This"/> is because normally the security of these documents is lower than the level applied when issuing biometric passports .

( PL ) Mr President , the harmonisation of <unk w="provisions"/> concerning security standards , in <unk w="conjunction"/> with the introduction of biometric identifiers , should have a beneficial effect on the verification of documents during their inspection , and so is an element in the fight against forgery .

In view of the lack of appropriate tests connected with the use of new technologies , <unk w="Member"/> States should introduce their <unk w="own"/> requirements in the area of protection of citizens ' rights .

An age limit above which children have to be passport holders needs to be established , and also cases in which a single passport is issued to a holder and his or her children without biometric data should <unk w="be"/> eliminated .

In order to preclude this type of procedure , each person should hold his or her <unk w="own"/> passport .

In closing , I would <unk w="like"/> to emphasise that , in order to ensure security for the holders of passports and other identity documents , a high level of discretion in the process of collection of biometric data should be introduced .

( EL ) Mr President , it is a fact that the amending regulation which we are being asked to approve will perhaps bring about an improvement in certain Member States in which biometric identifiers are even being taken from infants and will temporarily prevent certain Member States from dragging people under the age of <unk w="12"/> , who at present are not <unk w="obliged"/> in any case in certain countries to travel on a <unk w="personal"/> passport , through such procedures .

We must evaluate the exceptions being proposed on the basis of the real motives for adopting them given that , regardless of the age limit for taking biometric identifiers , at some point we may all of us without exception <unk w="be"/> on electronic record .

Regulations such as these essentially maintain and further institutionalise the use of methods for keeping records on citizens everywhere - <unk w="and"/> how many innocent citizens - and grant the right to move our sensitive <unk w="personal"/> data .

It <unk w="is"/> therefore our duty to remind the citizens , whom <unk w="we"/> shall be asking in a few <unk w="months"/> ' time to renew their vote in favour of principles and policies of the European Union , that we are not <unk w="in"/> favour of such measures .

However , all the Member States must understand in this respect that Frontex now needs to be upgraded in terms of funding and staffing so that it can actually perform its task <unk w="really"/> effectively .
