It is <unk w="important"/> for <unk w="us"/> to take advantage of the 10th <unk w="incidence"/> of this key event in European integration to pay homage , <unk w="in"/> my turn , to those men who created the euro , such as Pierre Werner , Helmut Kohl , François Mitterrand , Jacques Delors , Valéry Giscard d 'Estaing and others .

Those I have mentioned , <unk w="and"/> many others who accompanied them , could not <unk w="be"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> rapid success of their political project .

Since 1 January of this year , 16 Member States have been participating in the Economic and Monetary Union <unk w=","/> the euro <unk w="and"/> the currency of almost 330 million European citizens .

The euro , then , has become the most tangible sign of <unk w="european"/> integration .

As a tangible sign recognised around <unk w="the"/> world , the euro <unk w="is"/> a measure of stability .

<unk w="it"/> is protecting its citizens from the most serious consequences of the <unk w="bse"/> crisis .

After 10 years , it has to <unk w="be"/> recognised that the euro is an unquestionable <unk w="one"/> .

Now , anniversaries only have <unk w=","/> if they are bridges to the future , as we <unk w="have"/> to <unk w="ensure"/> that , <unk w="in"/> our collective indulgence as we congratulate ourselves , the true tests for the cohesiveness and coherence of the euro area await us .

This <unk w="means"/> , 2009 , will be an extremely difficult year for the euro area economies and for European citizens and there will be many <unk w="problems"/> facing us , both internally and externally .

Internally , euro area governments will have to act together to contain the effects of the economic crisis and <unk w=","/> in the structural bases of the economy to build a bridge to the post-crisis <unk w="economy"/> .

<unk w="we"/> must not lose sight of the fact that <unk w="the"/> euro , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> screen we have built around our <unk w="countries"/> , did not <unk w="only"/> fall into our laps .

The euro area <unk w="too"/> are better protected against negative economic developments because <unk w="the"/> part of the euro area is a mark of quality certifying <unk w="and"/> its members have a real capacity for implementing prudent macroeconomic policies and policies based on sustained growth and prosperity for <unk w="european"/> citizens .

The protection afforded <unk w="by"/> the euro is <unk w="a"/> <unk w="and"/> linked to our credibility , which rests on the ability to implement such policies .

This credibility is the foundation of the benefits of Economic and Monetary Union and we must maintain it to continue fully to profit <unk w="from"/> the benefits of <unk w="the"/> single currency .

Externally , <unk w="we"/> have to learn the <unk w="best"/> lessons from the international financial and economic crisis .

There is a direct causal link between the current crisis , with <unk w="its"/> origins in the United States , and the persistence of major world imbalances .

The re-establishment of stability in the financial and the real economy on a world scale <unk w=","/> a profound reform of the financial system and the elimination of the major imbalances in the mix <unk w="of"/> global consumption and global saving .

This balancing demands the active cooperation <unk w="of"/> the major economies in America , Asia and Europe .

Despite noticeable progress , the euro 's international image remains , too often , overly fragmented and national interests too often win out over the common interest , preventing the euro area from fully assuming the political responsibility that corresponds to its economic importance and from achieving all of the economic benefits deriving from Economic <unk w="and"/> Monetary Union .

Economic and Monetary Union is , of <unk w="course"/> , an <unk w="important"/> project , but it is , first of all , a political project .

As a result , we must take advantage of the euro 's second decade to perfect the Economic and Monetary Union by strengthening <unk w="the"/> political bodies , both internally <unk w="and"/> <unk w="countries"/> .

Mr President , Prime Minister , Chairmen of the committees , ladies and gentlemen , I am sure that I am echoing the views of the vast majority of this Chamber in saying that , 10 years <unk w="after"/> its launch , I , as a European , am proud of the success of the euro .

The euro and <unk w="economic"/> and Monetary Union have undeniably been a success .

Over these 10 years , the euro has brought many benefits to all its members <unk w="and"/> continues to do so today amid a <unk w="serious"/> economic and financial crisis .

The <unk w="first"/> is the second <unk w="of"/> the world <unk w="national"/> currencies and , thanks to its role in the international economy , is already comparable in some respects to the dollar as an instrument of commerce and means of payment in international <unk w="organisations"/> .

Above all , though , the euro is part of <unk w="the"/> daily life of nearly 330 million people <unk w="from"/> 16 countries of the European Union .

We all carry <unk w="out"/> our wallets this symbol of a shared <unk w="european"/> identity : because the euro , as well <unk w="as"/> being a currency , is a central element of our <unk w="political"/> project , reminding us in a <unk w="better"/> way of the benefits of the integration process that began over half a century ago .

The euro has given us low inflation and low <unk w="inflation"/> rates , thanks to a macroeconomic framework directed at stability .

The euro has provided a clear <unk w="approach"/> to trade and investment among its Member States .

The euro has also facilitated the creation of <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> million jobs over the last 10 years in the euro area , three times the corresponding figure from the previous decade .

The euro has encouraged financial integration and the <unk w="creation"/> of the single market ; it has protected the members of the euro area from external disruption ; and it has been <unk w="and"/> continues to be a pole of stability , not just for <unk w="the"/> European economy , <unk w="but"/> also for the global economy .

However , those who think that the Economic and Monetary Union is not ready to face the consequences <unk w="of"/> this crisis are quite mistaken .

<unk w="on"/> the contrary , if the single <unk w="market"/> did not exist , the <unk w="negative"/> effects <unk w="of"/> <unk w="this"/> crisis would be much greater .

Many <unk w="of"/> <unk w="which"/> would <unk w="surely"/> be facing great volatility in their exchange rates and , <unk w="indeed"/> , might even <unk w="be"/> suffering speculative <unk w="people"/> on their currencies .

The spread of their public debt <unk w="there"/> would be much greater than currently , and their margins <unk w="for"/> combating the crisis through <unk w="the"/> stimuli would be narrower .

The <unk w="stability"/> and Growth Pact , reformed in 2005 , <unk w="and"/> encouraged governments to sort out their <unk w="own"/> accounts , leading <unk w="by"/> 2007 to the lowest budget deficit for 25 <unk w="%"/> , which is now enabling them to face the <unk w="situation"/> in a better <unk w="future"/> .

Throughout this crisis , the actions of the European Central Bank <unk w="has"/> <unk w="do"/> nothing but reinforce the solid reputation that it <unk w="has"/> already earned in the early years of Economic and Monetary Union .

By decisively adopting the necessary measures and taking the lead in cooperating <unk w="with"/> the other central banks in <unk w="third"/> countries , the European Central <unk w="bank"/> has served as our guide throughout this period and has <unk w="thus"/> contributed to preventing huge financial collapse .

The economic situation is not <unk w="something"/> we would have hoped as we celebrate this anniversary , but events are highlighting <unk w="more"/> than ever the advantages of Economic and Monetary Union .

For those <unk w="countries"/> which have not yet joined , the euro area is an increasingly attractive option , as <unk w="the"/> last week in Bratislava when we welcomed <unk w="it"/> as the newest - the 16th - member of the euro family .

The European Commission and Parliament must continue working with Member States , the <unk w="eu"/> , the European Central Bank <unk w="and"/> the international community in order to place our economies on the path to the sustainable resumption of growth .

In this regard , the Commission 's recommendations in the report <unk w="that"/> we submitted a few months ago on the first 10 years of Economic and Monetary Union , which was <unk w="also"/> debated in this Chamber , are <unk w="still"/> <unk w=","/> or even more valid today than they were last spring .

Increased budgetary vigilance , its extension to other <unk w="social"/> aspects , the link between macroeconomic policies and structural reform , the external image of the euro and improved governance of the Economic and Monetary Union are , and must continue to <unk w="be"/> , the core themes on which to <unk w="protect"/> the euro 's second decade , with at least <unk w="as"/> many <unk w="years"/> as this first one .

Mr President , I would like to conclude by paying tribute to <unk w="the"/> vision and ambition of the founding fathers of the euro , whose imagination and resolute action bequeathed to us a currency of which all <unk w="we"/> can be proud .

The crisis has opened <unk w="up"/> a new chapter for the global economy , in which the Economic and Monetary Union must continue to play a relevant role in serving the common interests and ambitions of all Europeans .

<unk w="mr"/> President , Mr Juncker , Mr Trichet , ladies and gentlemen , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="commission"/> has been involved in creating <unk w="the"/> European currency is grateful to you , Mr President , and <unk w="to"/> you , <unk w="ladies"/> and gentlemen , for this <unk w="very"/> fine initiative <unk w="which"/> you have taken in commemorating the 10th anniversary of the birth of <unk w="the"/> euro .

I am one of those people who think that it is better to avoid the ever-increasing number of commemoration ceremonies , but this one is justified because it marks the greatest contribution to European integration since the <unk w="role"/> of the European Parliament by universal suffrage in <unk w="turkey"/> .

I would like to pay tribute to <unk w="all"/> those who mapped out this course and those who have followed it .

We can <unk w="achieve"/> its distant origins in the report from the <unk w="swedish"/> prime minister , <unk w="mr"/> Werner , your predecessor , in 1970 .

It was , however , the monetary crisis in the <unk w="way"/> that <unk w="it"/> <unk w="is"/> the currency flotation which triggered action in this area .

As <unk w="far"/> as the currency exchange rates were fixed , the <unk w="current"/> system did not upset <unk w="any"/> attempt to create a common market .

After the unsuccessful <unk w="decision"/> to create a monetary snake , the strong momentum from France and Germany between 1975 and <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> led to the meeting in Bremen , <unk w="the"/> northern <unk w="ireland"/> , <unk w="took"/> the decision to create the <unk w="european"/> Monetary System <unk w="to"/> introduce the ecu , the euro 's precursor .

This move had the <unk w="scope"/> and support of our partners in the Benelux countries and Italy .

After a period of <unk w="time"/> activity between 1980 and 1988 , the process was given new impetus with the creation by the Council <unk w="and"/> the committee <unk w="chaired"/> by Jacques Delors , resulting <unk w="in"/> the signature <unk w="of"/> the Maastricht Treaty .

<unk w="let"/> us salute the pioneers who have been involved <unk w="in"/> this along the way , as you yourself have recently , Mr President , as well as my friend , Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and his Secretary of State , <unk w="the"/> Lahnstein ; Bernard Clappier , the governor of the Banque de France at <unk w="the"/> time and co-author of Robert Schuman 's Declaration <unk w="of"/> 1950 ; Alexandre Lamfalussy , who provided us with his great , almost unique expertise during the <unk w="discussion"/> of the committee on European monetary union which we set up with Helmut Schmidt to <unk w="review"/> the project ; Jacques Delors , President <unk w="of"/> <unk w="and"/> European Commission , who took over ; and , last but not least , <unk w="the"/> negotiators and signatories of the Maastricht Treaty who drafted an excellent text , which has not actually been touched since then , headed by <unk w="the"/> Helmut Kohl and President François Mitterrand , whose <unk w="calculations"/> must <unk w="be"/> mentioned in particular , along with their other colleagues .

Today <unk w="we"/> must say a big ' <unk w="and"/> you ' to all <unk w="of"/> them .

On this occasion of the 10th anniversary , being celebrated at a time of crisis , what can <unk w="you"/> say in support of the euro ?

<unk w="first"/> of all , <unk w="the"/> euro 's success has exceeded expectations , not only of all its opponents , of <unk w="course"/> , but even of all <unk w="its"/> supporters .

I will not go into detail as you have only given me <unk w="five"/> minutes .

During the conversations which I had with the most <unk w="important"/> monetary experts between 1995 and 2000 , they were all sceptical <unk w="about"/> the possibility of introducing the euro and making it a success .

In 10 years the euro has become the number two currency in <unk w="the"/> world and , as has been mentioned just <unk w="now"/> , one <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="most"/> respected <unk w="here"/> .

Its sound management has provided a <unk w="european"/> shield against the crisis and a platform for non-inflationary growth .

<unk w="but"/> the existence <unk w="of"/> the euro , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="it"/> would be <unk w="being"/> turned upside down by a monetary <unk w="union"/> , which <unk w="would"/> deepen the economic crisis .

<unk w="we"/> are expecting the <unk w="european"/> policy to try to contain , <unk w="within"/> the limits of the <unk w="commission"/> 's power , the depressing impact of <unk w="the"/> crisis and to pave the way for the return to <unk w="economic"/> growth , which we are not tackling yet , by which time the sizeable public deficits and level of debt triggered by the crisis ought <unk w="to"/> have been cleared .

In this respect , we are putting our trust in the managers and staff at the European Central Bank , <unk w="who"/> have demonstrated their considerable <unk w="importance"/> <unk w="from"/> the start of the crisis .

The euro is Europe 's currency and must express <unk w="its"/> distinct culture , promoting a rational <unk w="and"/> stable model among the world 's other currencies .

Finally , I do not think that the general public will need to wait too long for banking regulation to be restored in <unk w="the"/> euro area .

It seems to me that we <unk w="can"/> call on <unk w="the"/> <unk w="european"/> Central Bank to carry out this process of restoring order and supervise its implementation , <unk w="pursuant"/> to <unk w="article"/> <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> ( 5 ) of the Maastricht Treaty .

Indeed , we need a <unk w="new"/> impetus , <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and a <unk w="precise"/> timetable <unk w="for"/> the European Central Bank could draw up and which the Council of <unk w="ministers"/> <unk w="on"/> <unk w="the"/> euro <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> , presided by your good self , Mr Juncker , could then adopt and implement .

I will conclude , Mr President , by saying that the symbol of integration represented <unk w="in"/> the euro 's success must give us the courage to take the <unk w="first"/> step in creating this increasingly united Europe as recommended under the various treaties and which we are endeavouring to achieve .

<unk w="let"/> us counter the inevitability of failure with the <unk w="notion"/> of success .

That success today goes by the lovely <unk w="cent"/> of the euro .

Mr President , the <unk w="commission"/> is the successful <unk w="establishment"/> of a vision and political will , and not the product of the <unk w="future"/> .

It demonstrates the <unk w="best"/> that Europe can achieve when everyone joins forces .

I also want , of course , on this occasion <unk w="to"/> salute and thank on <unk w="your"/> behalf , on our children <unk w="on"/> behalf and on everyone else 's behalf , <unk w="the"/> founding fathers and the architects of this success : Pierre Werner , who is with us , Chancellor Helmut Schmidt , President Giscard d 'Estaing , the President of the European Commission Jacques Delors , Chancellor Helmut Kohl , President François <unk w="burg"/> , Baron Alexandre Lamfalussy , Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa , Philippe Maystadt and everyone else whom I have <unk w="just"/> mentioned .

I would also , however , like <unk w="to"/> pay tribute to the actions of your predecessors , Mr President , the actions of my predecessors , Karl von Wogau , who <unk w="is"/> still with us , and <unk w="mrs"/> <unk w="mrs"/> Randzio-Plath , who is also with <unk w="us"/> today .

The <unk w="role"/> of this Parliament played a crucial role in that , at the time of the transition <unk w="to"/> the euro , we were not <unk w="deeply"/> concerned <unk w="with"/> <unk w="the"/> transfer <unk w="of"/> accounts in the banks but <unk w="also"/> about our citizens , so that they could adapt to , get used to and adopt this new currency which was going <unk w="to"/> be theirs .

I <unk w="am"/> also pleased that this ceremony can take place here , in the <unk w="european"/> Parliament , the home of democracy for all Europe <unk w="'s"/> citizens .

After all , the euro is <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and foremost the concern of us all , and <unk w="also"/> of the banks .

However , Europeans themselves have adopted the euro as a symbol of <unk w="access"/> to the European Union .

There were 11 of us to start with , and <unk w="that"/> there are 16 .

However , I do get the feeling <unk w="that"/> this crisis is tempting some countries to reconsider whether they should belong to the euro area or not .

I think <unk w="that"/> this is the best proof of our success .

Europe makes <unk w="sense"/> , as is so often the case , by demonstrating its <unk w="position"/> and on this occasion to mark its 10th anniversary , we can clearly see that the assessment of <unk w="the"/> euro <unk w="is"/> largely a <unk w="difficult"/> one .

Some <unk w="of"/> which were hesitant could <unk w="be"/> <unk w="based"/> on the door of the euro area .

We can only encourage them to do this under <unk w="the"/> terms of <unk w="the"/> Treaty , which have <unk w="already"/> been revised and which are useful terms allowing Europe to progress in economic and monetary matters on the basis of the two pillars of consolidation and enlargement .

The euro , which has been enriched by these last 10 years , must now open up new areas for development , not that we have not dealt with these at all , but <unk w="also"/> because they are still work in progress ahead of us .

On the subject of economic cooperation , Jean-Claude Juncker <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="fact"/> that we are going through .

In <unk w="the"/> current crisis we all know that , <unk w="if"/> we had made progress in the Economic Union as quickly as we have in the Monetary Union , we would be even better off today .

<unk w="it"/> is not <unk w="possible"/> for us to <unk w="increase"/> on the budget deficit balances and not on <unk w="the"/> quality of public spending .

It is not normal for <unk w="member"/> States to borrow at <unk w="the"/> different rates of interest when they have the same currency and the same rate of interest set by the European Central <unk w="bank"/> .

The same applies <unk w="when"/> it comes to supervising the financial markets .

President Giscard d <unk w="'"/> mentioned Article 105 ( 6 ) , which is our common platform , allowing <unk w="us"/> to make progress .

I think that one of the lessons from this crisis <unk w="is"/> that it actually shows <unk w="that"/> the European Central Bank will need to have a <unk w="significant"/> role .

We do not want to disconnect the supervision of the financial markets from <unk w="international"/> supervision .

However , to <unk w="achieve"/> this , we will also need , as political leaders , to think about achieving a balance .

If the European <unk w="central"/> Bank sees <unk w="its"/> responsibilities strengthened , <unk w="it"/> will <unk w="have"/> to be <unk w="told"/> how the <unk w="right"/> balance on the whole needs to <unk w="be"/> <unk w="us"/> in the future .

I would like to make <unk w="a"/> final remark on the international role of the euro .

I agree that we <unk w="can"/> <unk w="to"/> demand the exorbitant privilege <unk w="to"/> <unk w="assist"/> the reserve currency .

However , it is not normal either for us to have <unk w="over"/> 10 years to create the euro and then , 10 years after the transition to the euro , <unk w="there"/> are still passive in the international arena and the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> <unk w="nature"/> of the <unk w="treaty"/> is not being heard more clearly in the process of restoring some balance to the global monetary <unk w="policy"/> .

This is why it is a major <unk w="problem"/> for this Parliament .

It is a tool at the service of our citizens who are going through the <unk w="current"/> crisis in years .

We <unk w="can"/> then use this wonderful creation , this <unk w="would"/> <unk w="in"/> Europe to help our citizens come through this crisis in the best conditions possible .

Anyone who <unk w="has"/> said 10 years ago that the euro <unk w="would"/> have developed as splendidly as it <unk w="has"/> done would have been laughed at .

Many people have contributed to this success , and I remember <unk w="that"/> <unk w="-"/> voices - it was referred to as a premature baby and an unviable <unk w="service"/> - and <unk w="because"/> we know that it was a vision to which <unk w="some"/> people contributed .

The previous speaker reminded us of all those who contributed to this , of the milestones , of the European monetary system , which was an agreement with the European Central Bank to create central rates , of the Delors report , which provided for the introduction of the monetary union <unk w="in"/> three stages , of the Treaty of Maastricht - only two years after the fall of the Wall - and <unk w="in"/> the transitional periods .

Many people have <unk w="failed"/> to make the euro the successful project it is today .

As the committee chairman , Mrs Berès , <unk w="have"/> already said , during this period , in particular from 1994 <unk w="to"/> the implementation <unk w="of"/> the Treaty of Maastricht began , and up to 2002 , Parliament actively cooperated in the introduction of <unk w="euro"/> notes and coins , and in <unk w="the"/> reports , discussions , opinions and also proposals , and I would like specifically to thank the two committee chairmen from that time , Mr von <unk w="wogau"/> and <unk w="mrs"/> Randzio-Plath , who also represented Parliament to the outside world and who gave this project , although originally created by the governments , the parliamentary <unk w="bodies"/> it needed .

We are working today , too , under the <unk w="leadership"/> of Mrs Berès , for the <unk w="necessary"/> representation .

<unk w="on"/> 18 November Parliament adopted , with a large majority , a report in which we <unk w="support"/> the <unk w="bbc"/> , <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , risks and <unk w="speed"/> , and I would like to mention just a few things in addition to what Mrs <unk w="lucas"/> has said .

The euro has been a great success , and it is a unique project : a <unk w="european"/> monetary policy under the management of the European Central Bank and local <unk w="communities"/> <unk w="to"/> finance policies .

It is important that , in future , the connection between these two levels of <unk w="development"/> in the Stability and Growth <unk w="pact"/> are retained also during times of <unk w="time"/> .

Without this Stability and Growth Pact , without stronger <unk w="reform"/> of the budgetary and finance policy , the euro would also in future face risks that are avoidable .

In this regard , I appeal in particular to the Member States of the euro <unk w="zone"/> , but also to the whole of the European Union , to take this discipline , this coordinated cooperation , more seriously than has <unk w="been"/> the case in the past in connection with certain issues .

The euro has pushed <unk w="out"/> inflation considerably and <unk w="has"/> created confidence and stability , <unk w="and"/> it has become the second most commonly held reserve currency <unk w=","/> a <unk w="period"/> of time that no one thought it capable of .

The euro has increased the pressure <unk w="on"/> structural reform in the Member States and therefore , even in the age of globalisation , has become a ' fitness programme ' for undertakings and for nations .

The institutions of the euro area - several were mentioned by the previous speaker - the Ecofin <unk w="council"/> , the Euro Group and <unk w="the"/> other institutions have created the necessary conditions together with the Commission and <unk w="the"/> European Central Bank , because they <unk w="are"/> already operating , because they were in place , because they worked independently in <unk w="order"/> to react quickly , reliably and correctly in the economic crisis .

The political conclusion from these common successes is that <unk w=","/> with a common currency and a common internal market have achieved a unique level <unk w="of"/> integration that will secure peace and <unk w="stability"/> .

There are <unk w="two"/> <unk w=","/> requests and demands to <unk w="take"/> the risks seriously : the drifting apart of <unk w="the"/> national economies , which is <unk w="there"/> with considerable risks in <unk w="accordance"/> with the growth of wages and <unk w="the"/> budget deficits , should not be concealed on <unk w="the"/> <unk w="ground"/> .

An entirely different aspect <unk w="of"/> the varying <unk w="aspects"/> of the interest rates for government bonds .

<unk w="we"/> are currently seeing the interest rate margin , which has no doubt decreased , increasing again , bringing the <unk w="series"/> of <unk w="outstanding"/> problems in this regard for individual <unk w="member"/> States within the euro area .

I would remind the <unk w="house"/> that , particularly in connection with <unk w="the"/> expansion of the euro <unk w="and"/> , no special <unk w="priority"/> may be given and that all states that are members of the euro area can , and must , comply with these conditions of <unk w="the"/> Treaty of Maastricht .

It has passed <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> first <unk w="time"/> and has provided a unique contribution to the permanent integration of our <unk w="citizens"/> in Europe .

Mr President , Mr Giscard d <unk w="burg"/> , Mr Juncker , Mr Trichet , Mr Almunia , ladies and gentlemen , many good points have already been made .

In 10 years , the euro has <unk w="been"/> a strong symbol for Europe .

Yet the idea that Europe could create a single currency , whose foundations were laid especially in the Bremen agreement on the <unk w="legal"/> system in 1978 and the creation of the ecu , would have <unk w="been"/> met at the time with scepticism from the markets and the main monetary authorities outside Europe .

<unk w="i"/> should warmly thank and congratulate all those who made the decision and whose <unk w="decisions"/> have been <unk w="approved"/> here .

The creation of the euro is the best proof that Europe <unk w="is"/> capable , given the political will , to take long-term decisions for a <unk w="democratic"/> , prosperous future .

This anniversary , then , gives us a particularly apt message of hope for today 's <unk w="debate"/> .

For those who do not , the euro <unk w="is"/> associated with <unk w="the"/> rises .

Studies have , in fact , shown <unk w="that"/> in most countries inflation was felt even though the official <unk w="government"/> showed that , due especially to the action of the European Central Bank , monetary <unk w="union"/> had been ensured .

The reality <unk w="is"/> that <unk w="it"/> definitely took advantage of the euro to round up some <unk w="countries"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> consumers were not vigilant enough .

When the euro has risen <unk w="to"/> the dollar , we have also heard comments from some <unk w="members"/> who for the most part produce in the <unk w="free-trade"/> area but sell outside this area .

The European Central Bank has not been without its critics , who have not called into question its independence but rather <unk w="a"/> policy on <unk w="the"/> <unk w="issues"/> , which seemed to be too high .

<unk w="we"/> all understand that <unk w="the"/> euro is a determining factor in restricting the <unk w="overall"/> <unk w="effects"/> of a crisis imported from the United <unk w="states"/> .

<unk w="it"/> would have been inevitable and we would not have avoided a currency <unk w="system"/> .

The <unk w="practical"/> results of the euro must <unk w="be"/> <unk w="able"/> to continue <unk w="trying"/> to broaden the coordination of economic policies and to respect the principles of the Stability and <unk w="growth"/> Pact .

It is true , at present , that exceptions may <unk w="be"/> <unk w="and"/> should be accepted , but they can <unk w="only"/> be temporary and <unk w="the"/> objective of balanced public finances must be <unk w="defined"/> .

High-quality public finances <unk w="and"/> economic <unk w="growth"/> are , in fact , in the long run , more than ever necessary .

They are the condition for the solidity of our <unk w="democracies"/> , the euro .

Mr President , during these times of uncertainty , it is important to <unk w="be"/> able <unk w="to"/> count on something with a reliable value : the euro .

As I was able to play a bit-part as a member of the Ecofin Council during the period of preparation for the future single currency , I could see the doubts on <unk w="both"/> sides of <unk w="the"/> argument and the pussyfooting of the <unk w="member"/> States , which <unk w="have"/> made the Eurogroup into a stronger forum for cooperation ahead of its time .

Furthermore , two of Europe <unk w=","/> finest achievements came about through the determination of a few states to forge ahead in making integration something real for all our fellow <unk w="citizens"/> .

I am referring <unk w="to"/> the Schengen <unk w="agreement"/> entailing the free movement of Europeans , which was implemented on the initiative of five states : France , <unk w="mr"/> President Mitterrand , Germany , with Chancellor Kohl , along with the Benelux countries .

Switzerland has now become part of the Schengen <unk w="agreement"/> , but the British and Irish are still shying away from <unk w="the"/> <unk w="commission"/> 's <unk w="country"/> .

<unk w="the"/> Mitterrand <unk w="if"/> Chancellor Kohl were also <unk w="the"/> political architects of the <unk w="commission"/> , even though there were many who <unk w="have"/> this monetary <unk w="college"/> , starting with Jacques Delors .

The first lesson I would like to draw from this is that anyone who wants a better Europe must not be <unk w="accompanied"/> <unk w="to"/> intergovernmental action , especially if there <unk w="is"/> a coalition of states which really want to move Europe forward .

The Prüm Treaty , which is intended to <unk w="combat"/> serious crime , is an example of this <unk w=":"/> enhanced cooperation for Europe .

At a time when the Constitutional Treaty is dead <unk w="and"/> buried , following the ' no ' vote from a strange coalition of political forces not only in France but in <unk w="the"/> Netherlands too , and when the indigestible piece of <unk w="work"/> known as <unk w="the"/> ' mini ' Treaty <unk w=","/> Lisbon is being blocked in Ireland and possibly in the Czech Republic as well , <unk w="we"/> should <unk w="ensure"/> that Europe is <unk w="a"/> functioning <unk w="by"/> relying on the huge area of enhanced cooperation .

In any case , the <unk w="introduction"/> of the euro remains intact .

Others are fretting about not being able to benefit more from the protective <unk w="measures"/> provided by the euro .

Even in the UK voices are being raised , questioning the country 's splendid isolation in the face of the pound 's collapse , which has <unk w="caused"/> its status fall from that of the world 's reserve currency to a run-of-the-mill <unk w="disadvantage"/> in less than a century .

<unk w="thanks"/> to the consistent actions of Wim Duisenberg , Jean-Claude <unk w=","/> and <unk w="his"/> likes , <unk w="the"/> euro has <unk w="become"/> the world 's <unk w="most"/> <unk w="of"/> currency in <unk w="recent"/> years .

Of <unk w="course"/> , the dollar remains king for global <unk w="development"/> , <unk w="by"/> providing a <unk w="private"/> investment , <unk w="and"/> the colossal debts accumulated by the United States in <unk w="which"/> the <unk w="republic"/> of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="relatives"/> to finance their lifestyle will increasingly sow the seeds of doubt as to the ability of the number one economic power to honour its commitments .

In fact , the financial world is tending towards a <unk w="european"/> / dollar duopoly .

Any monetary duopoly regularly goes through parity <unk w=","/> which often occur suddenly .

In these <unk w="fields"/> of widespread recession , the <unk w="economy"/> needs stability and new certainties .

As Jacques Delors said , the euro is <unk w="a"/> shield to <unk w="make"/> the whole of Europe , <unk w="and"/> the euro <unk w="has"/> not stimulated the European economy enough so far .

<unk w="at"/> the end of the day , the Commission is only a first-class consultant making suggestions which are generally useful , but the real economic players remain the states <unk w=","/> which , unfortunately , are operating in a disorganised manner .

Although the effective harmonisation of the cumulative economic power of 27 states <unk w="to"/> work miracles , the Eurogroup , <unk w="in"/> spite of the commendable efforts of Jean-Claude Juncker , still only remains an informal discussion group .

In the spring of 1999 , I was able to witness the attempt made within the Eurogroup <unk w="of"/> a few finance <unk w="ministers"/> , including Oskar Lafontaine , Dominique Strauss-Kahn , Carlo Ciampi <unk w="and"/> a few others , to establish economic and monetary cooperation between the European Union and the European Central Bank .

<unk w="mr"/> Duisenberg made the cutting retort : ' there never will be <unk w="any"/> ex-ante coordination with the European Central Bank as you are always going to have to react ex-post to our decisions . '

The reason for this is obvious : the ECB is and will remain independent in conducting its monetary policy , but independence <unk w="does"/> not mean a ban on constructive dialogue between institutions tasked with defending the interests and <unk w="the"/> destiny of 500 million Europeans .

There is nothing to prevent states from organising themselves better with regard to achieving proper coordination of their <unk w="legal"/> <unk w="policy"/> , whether it is inside the EU or especially <unk w="countries"/> representing <unk w="them"/> externally , as Jean-Claude Juncker so sensibly concluded just now .

Mr President , Mr Giscard d <unk w="burg"/> , Mr Juncker , <unk w="schmidt"/> Trichet , Mr Almunia , ladies and gentlemen , I find it very regrettable <unk w="that"/> relatively few Members are here today for this formal sitting , because it <unk w="is"/> <unk w="be"/> a historic event .

<unk w="we"/> <unk w="have"/> already heard from the various previous speakers how much scepticism there was when the euro was first introduced .

It was felt that the <unk w="commission"/> <unk w="was"/> involved in introducing billions of <unk w="euros"/> and coins alone would be unmanageable , and the idea that we could combine a common monetary policy with separate fiscal policies in the Member States was seen not just as a major <unk w=","/> but as simply impossible .

<unk w="the"/> monetary union is a reality ; the euro has been in existence for 10 <unk w="years"/> today .

This is something of a minor political miracle , and once again the words of Walter Hallstein , the first President of the Commission , have proven to be true : ' Anyone who does <unk w="not"/> believe in miracles in European matters is not a realist . '

The doubts of the citizens , many of whom , in many Member States , initially believed that the euro would <unk w="result"/> in huge price hikes , have now disappeared .

It has become something of a visible <unk w="european"/> <unk w="way"/> : besides the anthem and the flag , it is one of the few symbols we have today .

It <unk w="is"/> , I think , be said that , in the European Central Bank 's first few years , Europe and the European economy were sailing in relatively calm waters , <unk w="and"/> that <unk w="the"/> <unk w="have"/> found <unk w="it"/> pretty easy to pursue a policy of stability .

Even so , it is worth pointing out <unk w="that"/> <unk w="will"/> mean inflation rate over the first 10 years <unk w=","/> the euro has <unk w="been"/> approximately 2 % , in other words more or less on <unk w="the"/> target that the European <unk w="central"/> Bank <unk w="set"/> itself .

The German mark , on the other hand , which was always held up as a poster child <unk w="for"/> stability , had a mean inflation rate of 3 % over its 50 years of existence .

It can therefore be said that <unk w="the"/> European Central Bank has performed very <unk w="carefully"/> .

However , it is <unk w="not"/> , in this time of crisis , that the European Central <unk w="bank"/> is showing its <unk w="political"/> strength , its true quality .

It has <unk w="enabled"/> itself to be independent , efficient and self-confident , and it acts decisively and quickly .

It <unk w="has"/> become an example for some central banks , both <unk w="in"/> those European countries that are not yet part of the euro <unk w="and"/> <unk w="from"/> outside Europe .

It has made it quite clear to the <unk w="federal"/> Reserve in the United States that it can pursue a successful policy , not despite its <unk w="inflation"/> but precisely because it is politically independent <unk w=","/> not subject to instructions from <unk w="national"/> governments .

We now know that <unk w="at"/> the moment , after the banking sectors in the individual Member <unk w="states"/> <unk w="has"/> been brought under a protective umbrella , the Member States are in the process <unk w="of"/> developing various economic stimulus <unk w="and"/> to absorb <unk w="the"/> negative impact of the financial crisis on the real economy .

This will present the European Central <unk w="bank"/> with further challenges , because there is a <unk w="risk"/> that the differences in approach will result in distortions of competition , and that the convergence we have , in part , now achieved between <unk w="the"/> members <unk w="of"/> the euro area will be lost and we will see <unk w="such"/> divergent developments .

This needs to <unk w="be"/> counteracted , which is <unk w="why"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w=","/> so crucial and <unk w="very"/> important that the Stability and Growth Pact <unk w="is"/> <unk w="to"/> be undermined or discarded .

Quite the <unk w="opposite"/> : <unk w="we"/> must ensure <unk w="that"/> it remains <unk w="possible"/> .

That is why it is also so important for the necessary structural reforms , <unk w="both"/> the Commission and the European <unk w="central"/> Bank have repeatedly called for in the past , actually to be pursued in the individual Member States .

The European Central Bank will gain a new task in the coming <unk w="months"/> .

The crisis has taught us that we need some kind of <unk w="political"/> supervision of the <unk w="internal"/> market , and this is an area where the European Central Bank can play a major role .

It has signalled that it is , in principle , willing to introduce some kind of central European supervisory system analogous to the <unk w="european"/> System <unk w="of"/> Central Banks .

The euro area needs to <unk w="speak"/> with one voice , and <unk w="must"/> be represented as a unit in international organisations such as the International Monetary Fund and the OECD ( Organisation for Economic Co-operation and <unk w="employment"/> ) .

It is still true that a single currency without a single fiscal economic policy is , and will continue <unk w="to"/> be , a <unk w="political"/> undertaking .

The EU is still facing some major <unk w="problem"/> : we are facing high , and <unk w="still"/> rising , levels of <unk w="employment"/> , demographic changes , <unk w="political"/> pressures , increasing poverty in some sectors of society , and stiffer <unk w=","/> in the context <unk w="of"/> globalisation .

The euro area will only be able to meet these challenges <unk w="and"/> the economic policies of the Member States can be more closely interlinked .

The appointment of a president of the euro area was <unk w="the"/> first step in this direction , but it is <unk w="not"/> the <unk w="first"/> step : more is now needed .

Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , <unk w="for"/> 10 years , <unk w="a"/> growing space carved out by the euro in international trade and its use as a reserve currency show that <unk w="it"/> has become a world benchmark .

It has guaranteed monetary stability and has helped integrate the economies of the Member <unk w="states"/> that have adopted it , despite some errors of judgment that <unk w="have"/> problems for citizens both because of the actual exchange rates between <unk w="the"/> currencies and the euro and because <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="spot"/> checks subsequently carried out on the <unk w="transport"/> of goods and services .

The euro was created without <unk w="restrictions"/> imposed from outside and without any wars <unk w=","/> conquest or political hegemonies .

It was the result of the free coming together of 11 governments who believed <unk w="that"/> the <unk w="existence"/> of an economic and monetary union , <unk w="as"/> laid <unk w="down"/> <unk w="in"/> the Treaties , as an <unk w="initial"/> step in attempting to achieve the political union that still unfortunately remains out of our grasp .

Some problems that have occurred are due to inefficiencies in a system that was unprepared for <unk w="the"/> task of guiding the other great associated <unk w="countries"/> ; I am talking about the increasing pace of internationalisation and the great changes in the way trade is conducted at international level .

The <unk w="commission"/> has made it possible to face up to a series of difficulties , <unk w="the"/> most severe of <unk w="what"/> is <unk w="the"/> current financial crisis , and it has protected <unk w="itself"/> against the great stresses <unk w="and"/> have ravaged the markets .

Were it <unk w="not"/> for the euro , we would have repeated the experience of 1992 , only worse .

We mark this <unk w="dramatic"/> anniversary by <unk w="and"/> welcoming the entrance of Slovakia , the 16th country to join the euro area .

The measures introduced by the European Central Bank ( ECB ) and <unk w="the"/> Commission to combat the current crisis have acted as a buffer and a form of containment but <unk w="we"/> still maintain , as we have often done in this Chamber , that we find it inconceivable <unk w="to"/> have a monetary policy disconnected from economic policy .

Admittedly , the actual situation is somewhat anomalous : 16 Member States with the single currency , 27 national economic policies coordinated by the <unk w="union"/> as well as it can , and 11 Member States with national currencies .

Coordinating a monetary policy with an economic policy that does not actually exist is certainly no <unk w="good"/> feat , but if the <unk w="commissioner"/> responsible for economic policies <unk w="in"/> our countries <unk w="do"/> not <unk w="only"/> with the central banks and <unk w="the"/> ECB , which has to <unk w="implement"/> all <unk w="its"/> policies together , and vice versa , the European Union will find new difficulties in jointly facing up to the current crisis and also the continual challenges that the outside <unk w="union"/> and globalisation bring home to <unk w="it"/> .

We hope that recent experiences convince people of the need to face up to change <unk w=","/> <unk w="policy"/> , restoring the real economy to the centre and ensuring better cohesion and connection between the ECB and <unk w="the"/> European institutions responsible for laying down political <unk w="regional"/> planning strategy .

<unk w="the"/> very recent energy crisis has also <unk w="taught"/> us that a common economic policy on the main strategic topics is of vital <unk w="importance"/> to the public and cannot be <unk w="involved"/> .

If the political will is present , the introduction of such a <unk w="link"/> will be facilitated by the growing power of the euro .

Mr President , Mr Giscard d 'Estaing , Mr Juncker , Mr Trichet , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to remind you how , in 1992 , when it was <unk w="not"/> completely dubious as <unk w="to"/> whether the <unk w="greens"/> would vote in favour of the Maastricht Treaty , Jacques Delors <unk w=","/> to the general assembly of the French Green Party , <unk w="has"/> managed to deliver the missing 1 % or 2 % .

He said to us : ' Vote for the <unk w="resolution"/> , then we will have a political Europe , because if we do not create a political Europe to control Europe , the people will not accept it ; they will never accept it . '

Firstly , it seemed to us that the Maastricht criteria were going to drag <unk w="it"/> into at least five years of pro-cyclical recessionary policy and , <unk w="hence"/> , the way in which the monetary policy was incorporated into the <unk w="european"/> economic policy by the Maastricht Treaty was not satisfactory .

For the sake of the European Central Bank 's independence , we would separate monetary <unk w="policy"/> from the rest of the policies .

I must <unk w="say"/> quite <unk w="sure"/> that , even if I am still not <unk w="covered"/> by the <unk w="maastricht"/> Treaty today , like all the other Greens , I am rather <unk w="surprised"/> <unk w="to"/> the changes which the legislation and application of Economic and Monetary Union have undergone .

<unk w="however"/> , price stability has been established at a level of <unk w="much"/> less than , but close to , 2 % .

At the moment , when <unk w="the"/> world is being threatened by deflation and the situation is being aggravated by the tendency of some countries to hastily <unk w="what"/> their VAT rate as part of a Keynesian policy , it is obvious that setting this <unk w="increase"/> <unk w="of"/> 2 % is no longer just for show .

If we fail to keep to this 2 % target we run the risk of <unk w="the"/> very high real interest <unk w="is"/> being forced <unk w="to"/> us .

The second major reform is obviously the reform of the <unk w="stability"/> and Growth Pact carried <unk w="out"/> in 2005 , which allows us today to have a policy that is contracyclical <unk w="primarily"/> aimed <unk w="at"/> countering the crisis .

The third major transformation is the change to how things work <unk w="is"/> <unk w="done"/> .

This permanent dialogue , <unk w="as"/> highlighted once <unk w="again"/> in this Chamber , between Mr Trichet , Mr Almunia , Mr Juncker and Mr Barroso , is , strictly speaking , <unk w="annexed"/> to the Maastricht Treaty <unk w="treaty"/> .

I regard this form of cooperation between Mr Trichet and Mr <unk w="costa"/> , for example , to <unk w="clarify"/> the equivalent of that between Mr Bernanke <unk w="and"/> Mr Paulson , which is a positive and desirable development .

All I would say is that we need <unk w="to"/> apply properly the good aspects of the Maastricht Treaty .

We have a real problem in defining the exchange rate , which has been <unk w="mentioned"/> on several occasions by my predecessors .

The task of <unk w="reconciling"/> the exchange rate is assigned <unk w="to"/> the Council .

<unk w="we"/> must find the means to <unk w="ensure"/> that the Council sets an exchange rate for Europe which does not derive <unk w="away"/> from the interest rate chosen by the European Central Bank , but properly reflects an industrial policy .

Secondly , the European Central Bank <unk w="'s"/> objective is not only to maintain a rate close to 2 % but also to apply Europe 's policy , by that I <unk w="welcome"/> the Lisbon and Gothenburg Strategies .

<unk w="we"/> need to have a policy for refinancing and rediscounting <unk w="the"/> debts by the European Central Bank according to the Gothenburg and Lisbon Strategies .

Lastly , as has already been mentioned , there needs to be supervision at a European level and the European Central Bank is in the best position to perform this <unk w="policy"/> .

It is <unk w="true"/> that we are not taking advantage of this opportunity <unk w="for"/> <unk w="an"/> in-depth examination of the consequences of implementing neoliberal and monetarist policies - using the euro as an excuse - which have contributed to the current serious social situation and to increasing inequality , unemployment , precarious and <unk w="less"/> paid work , and poverty .

It is unacceptable that we <unk w="are"/> holding onto ideological dogmas , such as price stability <unk w=","/> the irrational criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact , which are <unk w="being"/> used as a pretext in order to <unk w="achieve"/> privatisation and remove responsibility for social functions from the state .

This approach also involves the idea of the minimal state and the greater <unk w="competitiveness"/> of the private sector , with the aim of imposing acceptance of so-called <unk w="public"/> restraint , which actually results in low , nominal wage rises and <unk w="is"/> a <unk w="reduction"/> in real wages , as <unk w="the"/> Portuguese case regrettably clearly demonstrates .

We cannot agree with the false independence of the European Central Bank , <unk w="which"/> is dragging its heels on the decisions to reduce interest rates and which is keeping the euro <unk w="right"/> solely to protect those countries with more developed economies and the more powerful economic and financial groups , thus worsening the hardships of the more fragile economies and those people with <unk w="the"/> financial resources .

This European <unk w="central"/> Bank policy has resulted in the contraction of the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="union"/> , clearly demonstrating <unk w="the"/> need for further reductions in the reference interest <unk w="issues"/> .

As <unk w="the"/> purchasing power of workers , the retired <unk w="and"/> pensioners has fallen over the last 10 years , <unk w="the"/> profits of economic and financial groups have reached their highest level <unk w="in"/> <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> years , resulting in the joy and satisfaction that we have heard in this Chamber .

Even now , in the crisis <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="has"/> caused , what they are doing is nationalising the damage in order to then privatise the profits , whilst workers , micro- and small entrepreneurs , the retired and the unemployed suffer <unk w="the"/> consequences of the crisis , <unk w="but"/> the right , in the best-case scenario , only to a few scraps .

Look at <unk w="what"/> is happening in the financial sector , <unk w="and"/> <unk w="central"/> banks have already increased their spreads more than <unk w="ever"/> since the <unk w="review"/> of the financial crisis <unk w=","/> where the margin charged has doubled in the space of a year , thereby penalising new credit even more .

We therefore insist on the urgent need for a proper break with these neoliberal and monetarist policies , putting an end to the Stability Pact , tax <unk w="companies"/> and the false independence of the European <unk w="union"/> <unk w="agency"/> .

We therefore insist on the need to significantly <unk w="improve"/> the <unk w="community"/> budget <unk w="line"/> on a <unk w="fairer"/> distribution of income and wealth , so that there is a real policy of economic and social cohesion and so that we reject measures that are just more of the same , in other words ' save yourself if you can ' measures , allowing the richest to become ever richer and the poor to become ever poorer , as clearly demonstrated by the increasing inequalities and disparities among the euro area economies .

We therefore insist on the need to support production <unk w=","/> micro- , <unk w="small"/> and medium-sized enterprises ; to promote quality public services ; to facilitate credit and improve the purchasing power of families , and not just the most disadvantaged , but also the middle classes ; <unk w="they"/> create more jobs , <unk w="not"/> to reduce the poverty and misery of <unk w="millions"/> of people <unk w="in"/> our countries .

on <unk w="behalf"/> <unk w="of"/> the IND / DEM Group . - Mr <unk w="president"/> , do enjoy the 10th birthday of the <unk w="house"/> because I very much doubt you will be celebrating the 20th .

What we have seen <unk w="this"/> morning has been reminiscent of the <unk w="former"/> Soviet times .

Do you remember when the five-year plans were announced to be successes often before they <unk w="were"/> even launched , with much talk of <unk w="the"/> harvests and wonderful production figures for <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> ?

Much like those days , we <unk w="have"/> been treated this morning to a succession of unelected , ageing bureaucrats <unk w="and"/> us what a great success the whole <unk w="process"/> has been .

It was last July when the European Central Bank put interest rates up , just at the very moment that the markets were going into meltdown and rates were being <unk w="used"/> across the rest of the world .

Remember that only <unk w="seven"/> countries - Denmark and <unk w="denmark"/> - had a referendum on the euro and both of them said ' no ' , that little word that you try and avoid if you <unk w="are"/> <unk w="it"/> .

<unk w="however"/> , as German <unk w="liberals"/> at the <unk w="other"/> said , should <unk w="we"/> have joined <unk w="the"/> euro , <unk w="and"/> the situation in Greece is , I think , <unk w="that"/> we should focus our attention .

Thousands <unk w="of"/> young people out on the streets <unk w="and"/> , demanding their government does <unk w="not"/> , demanding that their government cuts rates , demanding that <unk w="the"/> government devalues .

When people have taken away from them the <unk w="right"/> to determine their own futures through the ballot box , then I am <unk w="convinced"/> that violence becomes the only logical alternative .

What you have done with this euro is you have trapped <unk w="worded"/> in an economic prison .

You have trapped <unk w="me"/> in a <unk w="communication"/> from which it will take great courage to get out .

It will take leadership , or possibly the inevitable economic <unk w="situation"/> .

You can boo , you can jeer , but remember this : Britain outside of the euro has been <unk w="allocated"/> to devalue , has been <unk w="in"/> <unk w="in"/> slash interest rates .

We have been able to do the things <unk w="we"/> <unk w="we"/> need to do .

Jeer on if you like , but have you noticed that on the bond markets this morning Greek bonds <unk w="on"/> trading 233 basis points <unk w="on"/> than German bonds ?

Now I know that most of you in this room <unk w="is"/> <unk w="not"/> even <unk w="to"/> what that means and <unk w="what"/> <unk w="they"/> do will do their best to ignore it .

You <unk w="will"/> go on burying your heads in the sand if you want .

You can ignore the <unk w="situation"/> if you want to , but in time the <unk w="commission"/> will not ignore you .

<unk w="mr"/> President , in the <unk w="last"/> 200 years there have been at <unk w="least"/> half a dozen attempts to create single currencies or fixed exchange rate mechanisms .

All have failed , all have damaged the participants , and so <unk w="it"/> is with the euro .

The imbalances long predicted by <unk w="we"/> are starting to bite .

Bond <unk w="relations"/> between Greece and <unk w="turkey"/> have reached unprecedented levels - over 200 basis points .

in writing . - The tenth anniversary of the vote <unk w="on"/> the proposal , presented to Parliament , on behalf of the Council of Ministers , by Gordon Brown ( then president of the <unk w="commission"/> ) , <unk w="in"/> lock exchange rates at that day <unk w="the"/> level and to create the euro , is an opportunity <unk w="to"/> celebrate ten years of success , stability and <unk w="development"/> of what is <unk w="currently"/> one of <unk w="the"/> two leading currencies in the <unk w="future"/> .

The current economic crisis would have been compounded <unk w="and"/> turmoil on currency markets had we still had the peseta , lira , drachma and so on as separate currencies fluctuating wildly <unk w="with"/> each other .

The anniversary is also an opportunity <unk w="to"/> debate whether Britain 's long-term economic future lies with euro membership .

Of course , Britain can <unk w=","/> in the short run outside the euro , <unk w="for"/> <unk w="this"/> time , we stand to <unk w="point"/> out : our businesses are handicapped in the European market by conversion costs and hedging costs that their competitors in that market do not face ; and inward <unk w="it"/> into the European market will prefer to be in the major currency area rather than the smaller <unk w="countries"/> .

The formal sitting of the European Parliament marking the 10th anniversary of <unk w="economic"/> and Monetary Union ( EMU ) <unk w="at"/> a time of serious crisis in <unk w="the"/> capitalist system follows repeated resolutions and reports <unk w="by"/> the European Parliament on the <unk w="same"/> subject <unk w="there"/> is yet another attempt to gild the <unk w="president-in-office"/> of the anti-grassroots , anti-labour policy of <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> which , following the demise of socialism , <unk w="led"/> to the Maastricht <unk w="treaty"/> and its all-out attack on labour rights and freedoms .

EMU , the establishment of the European Central Bank and the launch of the euro are necessary links in the chain of capitalist restructurings being promoted by capital in order to defend itself <unk w="with"/> workers ' claims and safeguard its profitability by stepping up the <unk w="laws"/> of the working class and grassroots classes .

The arguments about price <unk w="stability"/> , reducing inflation and protecting <unk w="farmers"/> from risk and crisis have proven to be stale arguments .

EMU protects the profits of <unk w="the"/> monopolies and facilitates privatisation and merger .

This past decade , workers have seen their incomes shrink , industrial relations worsen , their insurance rights <unk w=","/> and health and education services deteriorate and made into privatised commodities .

Workers reject the European one-way street and its <unk w="representatives"/> , and also the Lisbon Strategy <unk w="adopted"/> the Lisbon Treaty , and are fighting against EMU and the EU itself for grassroots power and a <unk w="new"/> <unk w="state"/> .

Firstly , from the moment when the euro was <unk w="used"/> , in other words from 2002 to 2007 inclusive , the three Member States which were outside the euro area ( <unk w="finland"/> , Sweden and Denmark ) developed faster than the countries which were in the euro area .

Gross national income <unk w="for"/> those countries grew almost twice as fast <unk w="as"/> <unk w="the"/> average <unk w="in"/> the euro area , <unk w="whatever"/> the level of unemployment was lower .

It also seems that the fiscal policy pursued by <unk w="third"/> countries will be more effective than the fiscal policy in the euro area .

Thirdly , new Member States which are preparing to enter the euro area have to comply with many monetary and fiscal criteria <unk w="for"/> years before entry .

Some of these criteria <unk w="are"/> mutually contradictory , such as the <unk w="right"/> to be <unk w="included"/> in the ERM II <unk w="package"/> - <unk w="and"/> therefore the need to maintain the national currency 's exchange rate against the euro within a fluctuation band of ± 15 % - and at the same time to maintain a low <unk w="level"/> of inflation .

<unk w="the"/> devaluation pressure on <unk w="the"/> national <unk w="outermost"/> means the need <unk w="for"/> intervention by central banks , which means <unk w="that"/> greater amounts of <unk w="the"/> national currency into circulation , which obviously increases inflationary <unk w="costs"/> .

As <unk w="the"/> Commission wants to encourage new Member States , it should consider eliminating this obvious inconsistency .

<unk w="mr"/> President , ladies and gentlemen , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="economic"/> and Monetary Union began on 1 January 1999 , and 11 EU Member States adopted the single currency at the same time .

The euro was 10 years old on 1 <unk w="december"/> 2009 .

At the <unk w="same"/> <unk w="time"/> , Slovakia became the 16th country to use the euro .

Just as Mr Juncker stated to Parliament in his speech , the euro is very definitely <unk w="the"/> ' anchor of stability ' .

<unk w="this"/> is something the countries that have been left out of the euro area have <unk w="been"/> made painfully aware <unk w="of"/> .

Although the 10th anniversary of the euro is <unk w="caused"/> by <unk w="means"/> of a possible deepening of the <unk w="union"/> , I trust in the euro area 's ability to <unk w="participate"/> <unk w="in"/> the crisis .

According to the latest estimates , the effect of the agreed stimulus package will be considerably less than <unk w="the"/> 1.5 % of gross domestic product planned for the area .

<unk w="what"/> we need to <unk w="build"/> Europe 's <unk w="sake"/> in the supervision of the financial markets .

On 1 January 2009 the euro became the <unk w="weak"/> currency of Slovakia .

<unk w="from"/> that date , the double cross on three hills from the Slovak flag has also appeared on one-euro and two-euro coins and has been put into circulation <unk w="in"/> the euro area .

That day was a historic moment for Slovakia <unk w="and"/> we Slovaks are <unk w="very"/> proud to be the first country from the former <unk w="soviet"/> bloc to introduce the euro in this symbolic year of the 10th anniversary <unk w="of"/> the euro area .

I am appreciative of the <unk w="gratitude"/> <unk w="that"/> the current Slovak Government <unk w="and"/> subscribed to the commitment of Mikuláš <unk w="government"/> , whose cabinet , in <unk w="march"/> 2004 , adopted a plan to replace the koruna with the European currency and fixed the beginning of 2009 as <unk w="a"/> target date .

It also seems appropriate here on the floor of the EP to thank the Slovak people because it was they , as the main <unk w="result"/> in the challenging but necessary ' Dzurinda ' reforms , who persevered and helped Slovakia to become a successful European country .

From 1 <unk w=","/> 2009 the euro will link the people of Slovakia to the Union every day .

The introduction of the European <unk w="union"/> <unk w="over"/> 10 years ago marked the completion <unk w="of"/> a process whose implications go far beyond the economic sector .

The finalisation of the Economic and Monetary Union process demonstrated <unk w="member"/> States ' commitment to safeguard the EU 's economic and political unity .

<unk w="the"/> euro <unk w="has"/> success therefore means success in the process of building an entity <unk w="and"/> to <unk w="protect"/> European values at international level and confirm the European Union as the main player in business and financial relations within the <unk w="irish"/> economy .

I believe that the benefits offered by adopting the <unk w="reforms"/> , involving macroeconomic <unk w="reforms"/> , a significant <unk w="reduction"/> in price fluctuations , <unk w="the"/> promotion <unk w="of"/> job creation and support for productivity growth , all underpinned <unk w="by"/> strengthening resistance to external shocks , <unk w="and"/> all the efforts made by the new Member States , especially Romania , to meet the <unk w="same"/> <unk w="criteria"/> as soon as possible and join the euro area .

Since <unk w="the"/> euro was launched on 1 January 1999 , <unk w="the"/> single currency has , in many <unk w="years"/> , proven to be an important factor <unk w="in"/> the stability of the EU economy .

The single <unk w="market"/> is , first of <unk w="all"/> , a driving force for European exchanges : the disappearance of exchange rates in the euro countries <unk w="is"/> an important and visible benefit for citizens , and promotes mobility within the EU .

In <unk w="addition"/> to <unk w="the"/> obvious benefits , <unk w="the"/> euro has also <unk w="arisen"/> as an anchor in the financial crisis .

Only a major currency used by many Member States and national economies <unk w="are"/> able to cushion the dramatic effects of economic collapse .

Monetary union means that macroeconomic levers can be applied at international level <unk w=","/> active responses can <unk w="be"/> made to the financial crisis .

Finally , though , the <unk w="commission"/> is also a symbol of European integration and the long road that the European people <unk w="have"/> already travelled together .

Monetary union is the next logical step after economic union , and should also <unk w="be"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="need"/> for deeper European integration .

Nearly one year ago , when marking the 10th anniversary <unk w="of"/> the creation of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) and Economic and Monetary Union ( <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> ) , we highlighted the fact that : ' In the ten years it has been in existence , the results achieved by EMU <unk w="is"/> a resounding success . '

I think that this <unk w="report"/> is quite appropriate as I am a strong believer in the importance of the solidarity which <unk w="we"/> <unk w="we"/> need to show in their joint actions to combat the effects of <unk w="the"/> financial crisis and reduce the adverse impact of <unk w="the"/> global economic crisis .

Europe is in <unk w="the"/> most <unk w="important"/> economic situation since the end of the Second World War .

The introduction of the European <unk w="single"/> currency and the creation <unk w="of"/> EMU were joint decisions made through harmonisation and solidarity based on European values .

This is the kind of attitude which we <unk w="urgently"/> need this <unk w="directive"/> in order to <unk w="achieve"/> and <unk w="to"/> implement measures to combat the financial crisis .

Europe 's competitiveness has to <unk w="be"/> maintained within the euro area and <unk w="will"/> be boosted in Member States which are preparing to join the euro area .

Madam President , I have been trying to wave to an usher throughout <unk w="the"/> voting procedure <unk w="in"/> order to give explanations of vote , but because you conducted votes so brilliantly and we got <unk w="through"/> them so quickly , an <unk w="agreement"/> has <unk w="been"/> quite made it too me yet .

I am holding a piece of paper asking to give two oral explanations of vote on the McGuinness <unk w="and"/> Breyer reports .

My request is <unk w="in"/> its way to <unk w="as"/> as well .

( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , it gives me <unk w="great"/> pleasure to speak in this great parliamentary Chamber , crowded <unk w="the"/> Members from all 27 <unk w="of"/> our Member States .

It falls to me on this occasion to explain my vote in favour of the report by Mr Belder on trade <unk w="and"/> economic relations with Western Balkans .

I am absolutely in favour of the <unk w="european"/> Union making it as easy as possible for these Balkan states <unk w="to"/> join the European <unk w="union"/> .

I believe that it is important for economic aid to be higher than that allocated <unk w="to"/> <unk w="it"/> , and that we should make it possible to increase links <unk w="with"/> the Balkan states and Europe , develop tourism and allow all Balkan citizens , young and old , to <unk w="have"/> a better <unk w="life"/> <unk w="than"/> they have until now .

<unk w="mr"/> President , first , I just wish to record the fact that I pressed the wrong button on the <unk w="paasilinna"/> report .

In <unk w="conclusion"/> , I <unk w="fully"/> support the McGuinness report on <unk w="social"/> security - but I will check that <unk w="all"/> the services later .

I particularly agree with the point <unk w="that"/> we need <unk w="to"/> adapt the CAP to meet food security concerns and the fact that farmers need a stable policy environment in order to plan for the future .

We cannot have certainty , but we certainly need to have some <unk w="questions"/> .

In addition , I support <unk w="the"/> fact that the market alone cannot provide income security for <unk w="consumers"/> and also the call for a detailed impact assessment , in particular , let us say , on the implications for food security .

If we look <unk w="in"/> particular EU proposals , for example on plant protection , again we need a proper detailed impact <unk w="assessment"/> on that , and we <unk w="need"/> to <unk w="have"/> food security <unk w="and"/> consideration when we conduct that assessment .

Madam <unk w="president"/> , I would like to thank colleagues for their endorsement of this report and Marian Harkin for her words of support .

<unk w="it"/> presents a clear statement of the view of this House on agriculture policy , not just at the European level , but also <unk w="on"/> a global level .

In particular - and this is important - it calls for a refocus on agriculture policy in <unk w="the"/> developing <unk w="countries"/> , providing assistance to those who can produce food to do so locally .

I believe the <unk w="usd"/> 1 billion that the European Union will provide for this <unk w=","/> is a step in the right direction .

<unk w="in"/> the food security debate has gone off the political agenda , the problem of 30 000 children <unk w="die"/> <unk w="s"/> hunger and starvation every day <unk w="to"/> <unk w="of"/> us .

<unk w="mr"/> President , I am grateful to you for giving <unk w="me"/> the opportunity to <unk w="explain"/> why I abstained on the McGuinness report .

It focuses on a very important aspect of the European Union and that is the absolute essentiality <unk w="of"/> ensuring food supplies <unk w="for"/> those who are starving or those who do not have a proper food supply .

Nobody could <unk w="vote"/> against <unk w="it"/> , and I <unk w="am"/> certainly not against that .

But the problem with the report , in my view , is that it looks and refers to the common agricultural <unk w="policy"/> <unk w="which"/> does not address the fact that there is an <unk w="urgent"/> need for the reform , and further reform , of that policy .

<unk w="if"/> that burden is taken away from the European taxpayers , then we are going to be in difficulties .

<unk w="however"/> , the objectives of the report are right , but I am afraid that it fails very badly in addressing the core problem .

<unk w="the"/> fluctuations in food prices <unk w="are"/> going to occur in the global market with increasing frequency , which will <unk w="have"/> negative consequences .

Price rises are felt most by <unk w="their"/> families , who spend a significant <unk w="part"/> <unk w="in"/> their budget on food .

It <unk w="is"/> just such people who deserve help : the most needy people , both in developing countries and in the European Union .

I agree <unk w="with"/> the common agricultural policy should be adapted <unk w="to"/> the new conditions in order to better address the problems of food security , <unk w="and"/> this is why the removal of instruments which manage markets and a reduction in the level of EU expenditure on agriculture in the future financial perspective should be <unk w="defined"/> .

It is a good idea <unk w="to"/> establish an international body which will observe the prices of agricultural products and factors of their production under the auspices <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="democrat"/> and Agriculture Organization , in order to monitor these data on a <unk w="european"/> scale and to <unk w="be"/> able <unk w="to"/> react rapidly to fluctuations .

<unk w="mr"/> President , I am grateful for this opportunity to explain why I also abstained on this report .

The problem <unk w="is"/> that we do not agree on what food security is .

To many of us , food security is making sure that there is <unk w="no"/> food for the people of the world - wherever they come from .

Food security <unk w=","/> them means only <unk w="is"/> produced in the EU <unk w="as"/> Europeans .

I hear people <unk w="have"/> the excuse of food security to keep <unk w="their"/> imports <unk w="from"/> the rest of the world , thereby <unk w="guaranteeing"/> <unk w="a"/> high-quality <unk w="product"/> that we see <unk w="the"/> <unk w="some"/> of the poorer countries of <unk w="the"/> world and condemning many more farmers in poorer countries to poverty .

To say that a common agricultural policy should <unk w="be"/> the cornerstone of food security is an amazing statement which needs to be shot down .

I abstained because it was my party <unk w="'s"/> whip to abstain on this report , but everybody knows that food security <unk w="is"/> a <unk w="very"/> important subject to us all , which is why I am <unk w="delighted"/> by the way that this place <unk w=","/> with such a matter .

In <unk w="this"/> particular report - <unk w="and"/> I believe we all voted <unk w="against"/> - we <unk w="solve"/> the problem we were <unk w="not"/> <unk w="not"/> to create for ourselves by voting for the <unk w="data"/> protection products directive .

Madam President , one of the biggest concerns and one of the keys in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="european"/> global food security is to ensure sufficient , sustainable production and , <unk w="secondly"/> , food security <unk w="and"/> the so-called developed world , such as here <unk w="in"/> the EU , so <unk w="that"/> we can export our surplus <unk w="and"/> <unk w="they"/> are not <unk w="yet"/> <unk w="disadvantage"/> on world markets for food , thereby increasing the <unk w="conditions"/> for those in <unk w="europe"/> <unk w="who"/> do not have the climate , the soil , the <unk w="lack"/> <unk w="of"/> the investment to produce their own food .

We have <unk w="to"/> be very careful with our policies to ensure that we are responding not only environmentally but also globally to the necessity for sustainable food production .

( SK ) I voted for the <unk w="resolution"/> on the common agricultural policy and global food security because it deals with <unk w="something"/> that I have consistently been raising in the European Parliament as <unk w="a"/> <unk w="a"/> priority .

The second issue is the reduction in the <unk w="liberalisation"/> of <unk w="european"/> markets , especially by increasing stocks .

The third issue concerns halting the decline in the social importance of agriculture <unk w="and"/> increasing public awareness of its unique and irreplaceable role .

The fourth issue concerns ending the random operation of the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) by implementing a systemic organisation of <unk w="european"/> policy with a focus on <unk w="social"/> objectives .

The fifth and final issue <unk w="is"/> putting a stop to <unk w="the"/> agricultural decline in the <unk w="individual"/> Member States <unk w="covered"/> by the CAP 's <unk w="horizontal"/> principles , while <unk w="the"/> boosting utilisation of wasted agricultural potential in these countries , <unk w="the"/> new Member States .

Madam President , this <unk w="applies"/> to the core of this whole European Union .

Here we are approving more money to try and persuade the public <unk w="to"/> <unk w=","/> for the wretched Lisbon <unk w="summit"/> .

The public , on being given a chance in <unk w="the"/> Republic of Ireland , made it absolutely clear that <unk w="we"/> <unk w="do"/> not want it and if the people of Britain were to be given a chance - and they should have been <unk w="that"/> they were promised <unk w="to"/> <unk w="in"/> the last general election by the Labour Government - they would also vote overwhelmingly to reject this Treaty .

The message should be heard <unk w=","/> and clear in the European Union , it really should : people do <unk w="not"/> <unk w="do"/> it .

<unk w="we"/> do not want more control in Brussels <unk w="and"/> Strasbourg .

People want their own governments and their own legislatures <unk w=","/> <unk w="by"/> making the decisions that affect them .

Until that message is received <unk w="and"/> will keep pumping more taxpayers ' money into forcing people to <unk w="the"/> polling box in the pretence that you actually persuade them to change their minds .

Madam President , first of all I would like to say that this <unk w="is"/> an <unk w="important"/> <unk w="one"/> .

We are always speaking about connecting the EU to its citizens and <unk w="the"/> fact that the EU project cannot proceed without the involvement of EU citizens .

There are two types of democracy : representative , <unk w="and"/> we have in this House , and participative , which is what this report is all about .

However , it <unk w="is"/> <unk w="important"/> to understand that civil dialogue is two-sided .

Therefore , the concerns and ideas <unk w="put"/> forward by citizens must be taken into consideration by the EU institutions .

I think <unk w="we"/> have an excellent example <unk w="of"/> <unk w="that"/> in <unk w="the"/> one million signatures for <unk w="the"/> <unk w="in"/> the document that <unk w="we"/> are debating in this Parliament at the moment .

I disagree with the last speaker <unk w=","/> I believe , if we do pass the Lisbon Treaty , <unk w="but"/> it gives us the opportunity to connect citizens to the EU in a much <unk w="more"/> meaningful way .

Madam President , <unk w="it"/> <unk w="would"/> be inferred from <unk w="the"/> title of this report : ' Perspectives for developing civil dialogue under the Treaty of <unk w="nice"/> ' .

Never mind that , as <unk w="it"/> seems periodically necessary to remind this House , the Treaty of Lisbon is not in force .

It has been <unk w="several"/> times rejected in its several forms by 55 % of French <unk w="gdp"/> , <unk w="only"/> 62 % of Dutch voters and by 54 % of Irish voters .

<unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> on the Orwellian Ministry of Love bit of the title ' Perspectives for developing civil dialogue ' .

Now , ordinary voters unversed in the <unk w="current"/> idiom of the European Union might not understand those words , as we in this House do , to mean creating a new propaganda <unk w="method"/> to try and convince people to change <unk w="their"/> minds .

I have to say that not every euro in the vaults of the European Central Bank will serve to convince people of <unk w="the"/> intrinsically bad idea .

The EU <unk w="ought"/> to be <unk w="able"/> <unk w="to"/> receive as well as transmit .

Madam <unk w="president"/> , thank you for giving me the opportunity to explain the way I voted <unk w="for"/> this report .

When I read <unk w="the"/> title of the report , ' Civil dialogue under the Treaty of Lisbon ' , it reminded me of a phrase by Mahatma <unk w="""/> .

When he was asked about <unk w="european"/> civilisation , he said , that ' that would be a good idea ' .

Therefore , when I <unk w="confirm"/> this title , ' Civil dialogue under the Treaty of <unk w="nice"/> ' , I thought , ' that would be a good idea , would <unk w="be"/> not ? '

One of the previous <unk w="speakers"/> said that dialogue is very much a two-way process , <unk w="and"/> if we look at <unk w="some"/> of the civil society organisations being funded in <unk w="order"/> to promote the Treaty of Lisbon , we only see organisations that are fully signed up <unk w="by"/> promoting <unk w="the"/> fundamentally undemocratic <unk w="democracy"/> .

How <unk w="many"/> organisations that <unk w="operate"/> against <unk w="the"/> Treaty will be funded or will be allowed to be promoted ?

<unk w="there"/> is no two-way dialogue , and that <unk w="is"/> why the citizens <unk w="of"/> the EU , when they are <unk w="not"/> the chance and asked about the <unk w="college"/> of Lisbon , will choose <unk w="or"/> reject it .

I wanted <unk w="to"/> <unk w="speak"/> on this but I have just got too much to say today , I am so <unk w="surprised"/> by all the votes that have been going through the Chamber today .

<unk w="however"/> , the common fisheries policy ; yes , let <unk w="us"/> <unk w="bring"/> about sustainable development - but the two are inherently contradictory .

If you want to look at a sustainable fisheries policy , you have <unk w="to"/> look at property rights and market-based solutions .

Look at those countries where fishermen are given <unk w="those"/> that are tradable and passed on from generation to generation .

That is the best way to make sure that we have sustainable <unk w="transport"/> <unk w="creation"/> , not some artificial communistic method where you have central planning in fishing .

That is why we are seeing <unk w="the"/> depletion of fish stocks , and we will all suffer in the end .

<unk w="i"/> will return to the explanations of <unk w="vote"/> after the formal sitting .

Mr President of the Republic of <unk w="korea"/> , the right honourable Valdis Zatlers , it is a very great pleasure for us all to be able to welcome you today on your first visit to the European <unk w="parliament"/> .

I should like to start <unk w="by"/> <unk w="thanking"/> you , as the President of a country which is still a <unk w="completely"/> new Member State of the European Union , for accepting the European Parliament <unk w="'s"/> invitation to address us today , the day on which we are celebrating the 10th anniversary of our common currency , the euro .

Today is a premiere in every sense of the word , <unk w="and"/> this was the first <unk w="time"/> that the European hymn has <unk w="always"/> played to welcome a <unk w="visit"/> to plenary here in the <unk w="european"/> Parliament .

May I take this opportunity to mention once again today the historic significance <unk w="of"/> the enlargement of the European Union in 2004 .

It took over 60 years to bring your country back <unk w="to"/> a <unk w="strong"/> <unk w="of"/> democratic Europe and unify our continent .

Our citizens <unk w="have"/> prospects that our forefathers could only have dreamed of .

It is true that today the European Union faces new and serious <unk w="problems"/> .

Even the people of Latvia have come to feel this quite clearly , for example <unk w=","/> a result of the financial crisis , which has also hit your country hard , Mr President .

<unk w="it"/> is precisely in times <unk w="and"/> <unk w="so"/> that we understand the value of membership <unk w="of"/> a European Union based on the principle of solidarity between its peoples .

It is precisely <unk w="for"/> this time <unk w="to"/> crisis that we all feel the need <unk w="for"/> community and cooperation between our countries and the European institutions .

Together we are stronger , <unk w="and"/> we can defend our interests and values better throughout <unk w="the"/> world .

That is also why the <unk w="european"/> Parliament <unk w="adopts"/> the <unk w="maastricht"/> Treaty , which gives the European <unk w="union"/> a stronger capacity to act to overcome these serious challenges , will shortly enter into force .

In this respect , the European <unk w="parliament"/> elections due to take place in June this year are immensely important , because we want to <unk w="go"/> ahead with the success story of the European peace and unification project together , in a democratic European <unk w="union"/> with a <unk w="european"/> Parliament <unk w="and"/> codecision <unk w=","/> in nearly every area .

I truly hope that the citizens of Latvia - and of all the other Member States of the European Union - will understand that their vote is important because it gives them European powers of <unk w="responsibility"/> and <unk w="in"/> this sense will turn out in force <unk w="in"/> the forthcoming elections to the European Parliament .

Mr President , it gives me great pleasure to invite you <unk w="not"/> to address the European Parliament .

Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I thank the <unk w="commissioner"/> for his kind words of introduction and his invitation to address the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> representatives of the nations of Europe .

I take <unk w="great"/> pleasure in <unk w="congratulating"/> the European Parliament in my <unk w="mother"/> tongue , especially because <unk w=","/> five years now , Latvian has been one of the official languages of the European Union .

I am speaking to you today <unk w="at"/> a time when the term of office of the first Members of the European Parliament to be elected from Latvia is drawing to a close .

I thank you for having carried <unk w="out"/> your duties with distinction .

Dear friends , this year , 2009 , is a <unk w="very"/> significant year for Latvia .

It is five years <unk w="to"/> Latvia acceded to the European Union and to NATO .

Membership of these international organisations became a strategic aim for Latvia <unk w="and"/> <unk w="the"/> restoration of independence in 1991 .

Latvia clearly expressed its wish <unk w="to"/> participate in <unk w="democracy"/> and transatlantic economic and security structures .

The enlargement of the <unk w="wake"/> of European democratic nations in the first decade of the <unk w="twentieth"/> century represented the most dynamic changes <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> since the foundation of the European <unk w="union"/> .

European structures were <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> by nations that had long been isolated by force from them , even though the values that lie <unk w="at"/> the heart of the European <unk w="union"/> had historically been <unk w="included"/> in these nations .

On <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> November last year , Latvia celebrated the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> anniversary of its <unk w="report"/> .

<unk w="we"/> once again affirmed our steadfast will to live in an independent , free and democratic nation .

<unk w="the"/> <unk w="we"/> <unk w="da"/> declaring the Republic of Latvia in 1918 it is written that : ' <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> citizens regardless of their ethnic origin are called on to give their assistance , for all human rights shall be guaranteed in Latvia .

It shall be a democratic and just nation , where there shall be no <unk w="respect"/> for oppression and injustice ... ' .

<unk w="ten"/> years before the adoption of <unk w="the"/> Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the Republic <unk w="of"/> <unk w="turkey"/> <unk w="and"/> its loyalty to its fundamental values and principles .

Latvia has always felt itself to belong to Europe <unk w="and"/> its values , even when <unk w=","/> and <unk w="the"/> Central and <unk w="eastern"/> European nations were <unk w="therefore"/> bound to a state <unk w="where"/> many values were looked at through a special ideological prism .

Peace reigned among <unk w="the"/> nations of the Eastern bloc , but it was the peace of the prison courtyard .

<unk w="this"/> was brought about <unk w="by"/> the presence of tanks , <unk w="terrorism"/> and threats .

Last year , ladies and gentlemen , both <unk w="parliament"/> and the whole of Europe were reminded of the inhumanity of totalitarian ideology by Edvīns  nore 's film ' A Soviet Story ' .

We have a common history , but <unk w="we"/> fates have been diverse .

You have to look back into the past in order to understand one another and <unk w="not"/> to the future together .

That is why I should like to thank the European Parliament for the <unk w="resolutions"/> adopted on 22 September last year to proclaim 23 August as the European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism .

This declaration reminds the <unk w="whole"/> <unk w="of"/> Europe <unk w="following"/> these tragic events in the <unk w="middle"/> of Latvia and the whole of Europe .

Today , I <unk w="would"/> like <unk w="to"/> look at much more <unk w="to"/> history .

This year marks five years since Latvia became a member <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="european"/> Union and of NATO .

What <unk w="is"/> our nation 's achievements been and what <unk w="are"/> the challenges still ahead of <unk w="this"/> ?

Firstly , the aspiration to become part of Europe encouraged the consolidation of <unk w="democracy"/> in our society <unk w=","/> contributed <unk w="to"/> the <unk w="reform"/> of democratic institutions .

With <unk w="the"/> <unk w="regard"/> to the European Union , <unk w="has"/> signalled its determination for its <unk w="the"/> future , its determination to found its future on a European identity <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> our common values : <unk w="freedom"/> and democracy , accountability , the rule of law and human rights , equality , tolerance and prosperity .

Secondly , membership <unk w="of"/> the European Union has improved <unk w="the"/> investment climate in Latvia .

' European money ' , as we commonly <unk w="know"/> European <unk w="union"/> structural funds , has contributed significantly to <unk w="the"/> development of Latvia 's <unk w="railways"/> .

Thirdly , we <unk w="must"/> enjoy the privileges afforded by the free movement of persons .

Free travel in the Schengen <unk w="area"/> has <unk w="become"/> so <unk w="on"/> and self-evident ; it has become so natural <unk w=","/> <unk w="politically"/> , work and gain experience in other European Union Member States .

Every entrepreneur and consumer can <unk w="be"/> in a free environment without borders and without customs duties .

For us in a <unk w="sector"/> with a small internal market , this is <unk w="very"/> important .

Fifthly , and most important of all , Latvian voices are heard <unk w="throughout"/> Europe and European <unk w="citizens"/> are heard in the world .

It allows all of us to <unk w="work"/> together for active solutions to global challenges , climate <unk w="and"/> demographic <unk w="change"/> , the reinforcement of <unk w="social"/> security , the problems of migration , and in the case of financial crisis , on a worldwide scale .

Latvia <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> has at its disposal new political and economic instruments , but it must be noted that <unk w="the"/> nation 's responsibility for the common future of <unk w="society"/> , a responsibility before all the people of Europe , has also significantly increased .

Looking back at our achievements , we <unk w="must"/> also be critical and own up to mistakes that have been committed .

<unk w="we"/> did not recognise that we were only at the beginning and <unk w=","/> at the end of the process .

We have not <unk w="been"/> sufficiently determined to adopt the euro ; that is one of the greatest mistakes we have made in the euro integration process , something that is acutely evident today in the circumstances of the financial crisis .

Is there anyone who <unk w="wants"/> to wait in a queue at the border in order to enter a neighbouring country ?

Is there anyone who <unk w="wants"/> to return to a world where there are restrictions <unk w="on"/> the free movement <unk w="of"/> workers , on their education and on <unk w="their"/> gaining experience ?

Ladies <unk w="and"/> gentlemen , the deterioration of the situation within the financial system and economy in recent months has irreversibly changed the role and significance of national governments within <unk w="the"/> processes .

Until now , the financial markets were able to develop very <unk w="quickly"/> .

We were persuaded that <unk w="the"/> laws of the market would by themselves be sufficiently efficient in promoting economic development .

We believed <unk w="that"/> the market alone would put everything in <unk w="the"/> place .

What we can see from this global crisis , however , <unk w="is"/> that <unk w="the"/> <unk w="existing"/> systems and our economies <unk w="are"/> suffering from that market , and most important of all , real people are suffering from the crisis .

The course of events at the end of last year has shown us that it is essential for national governments to play a more active part in the <unk w="peace"/> process .

The previous approach , of nodding off at the <unk w="expense"/> of economic management , was <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .

In this situation , a complex approach <unk w="to"/> national , European and global level is what is needed .

<unk w="at"/> the global level , coordinated action <unk w="and"/> restart economic growth <unk w="is"/> essential .

That <unk w="will"/> only be possible by designing a new architecture and mechanisms <unk w="for"/> the financial system .

At the <unk w="same"/> <unk w="time"/> , we have a significant advantage , for we can implement coordinated measures , take <unk w="effective"/> action and achieve a sustainable solution .

<unk w="this"/> is an important <unk w="way"/> out of the morass in which <unk w="we"/> find ourselves at this time .

I shall spend a <unk w="little"/> more time on national-level solutions .

There is a <unk w="series"/> of <unk w="opinion"/> which suggests <unk w="that"/> Latvia <unk w="is"/> currently undergoing one of the most dramatic rescue operations of any financial system in <unk w="the"/> European history .

Currently , Latvia is working on measures to stimulate the economy in order to stabilise the financial <unk w="and"/> economic situation swiftly and effectively .

It is a difficult task , but we shall succeed in overcoming <unk w="the"/> crisis only by seeing a clear way out of it , <unk w="and"/> not by mistaking short-term solutions for a long-term vision of economic development .

At the end of last year , <unk w="the"/> political <unk w="prisoners"/> represented in the Latvian parliament , from <unk w="the"/> government and opposition , <unk w="and"/> on a common stance of <unk w="respect"/> for <unk w="an"/> economic stabilisation plan drawn <unk w="up"/> by the Latvian government .

This agreement provides for special attention to be paid to monitoring how the loan <unk w="is"/> to <unk w="what"/> is <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .

The plan defines the medium-term priorities for Latvia 's economy : support for exports , the <unk w="manufacture"/> of free and fair <unk w="market"/> , a significant reduction in the current-account deficit in the balance of payments , and the introduction of the <unk w="euro"/> in 2012 .

<unk w="according"/> to the euro area has become one of our nation 's most important strategic goals .

It is important for Latvia not <unk w="to"/> be left alone in this situation .

We are being helped to <unk w="find"/> this difficult time not only by international financial organisations <unk w="but"/> also by <unk w="the"/> institutions <unk w=","/> <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> and by the nations of Europe .

Ladies and gentlemen , each enlargement has not <unk w="yet"/> brought the European Union new <unk w="member"/> States , but it has also introduced new accents into <unk w="the"/> agenda , including its foreign policy .

Latvia 's accession to <unk w="the"/> <unk w="european"/> Union took place at a time when Europe 's Neighbourhood Policy , its <unk w="principles"/> , principles and implementation mechanisms , were being <unk w="set"/> up .

Since <unk w="the"/> time , there <unk w="has"/> been a particular increase in the European Union 's foreign policy activity towards <unk w="the"/> eastern <unk w="europe"/> .

This has happened thanks to the engagement and experience of <unk w="the"/> new Member States .

Latvia will continue to play an <unk w="important"/> part in the determination <unk w="and"/> implementation of this policy in the future .

This <unk w="report"/> is not just a matter of the European Union 's relations with particular states , that is , with those states with <unk w="which"/> it shares a land or maritime border .

In <unk w="the"/> context of this policy , we must address the European Union 's <unk w="role"/> and role in the world .

Together with other like-minded nations , Latvia has actively encouraged a closer involvement by the European Union in its eastern neighbourhood <unk w="operates"/> .

A new <unk w="legislative"/> initiative , the ' Eastern <unk w="opt"/> ' has come about , whose mission is to reshape Europe 's common neighbourhood policy and adapt it to the specific <unk w="nature"/> of this region , thereby making this process more <unk w="effective"/> , more courageous and more ambitious .

In its practical work , the Eastern Partnership <unk w="will"/> strengthen the political and economic relations between the European Union and the states in this region , and also strengthen the mutual <unk w="balance"/> between those states .

In developing the Eastern <unk w="mediterranean"/> , attention must be paid <unk w="to"/> the differentiation <unk w="system"/> , individual assessment and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="attitude"/> towards each of the partners .

<unk w="one"/> of these states is following <unk w="its"/> own path of development .

There are those <unk w="workers"/> who wish to see themselves in the European Union , <unk w="but"/> there are those states that have chosen other goals for themselves .

Our policy <unk w="will"/> succeed only if we are able <unk w="to"/> work together with <unk w="all"/> the states of this region , helping with understanding where necessary .

I also received positive signals for extending <unk w="the"/> deepening cooperation <unk w="from"/> my visit to the Central Asian nations <unk w="in"/> October , when I visited Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan .

Latvia <unk w="must"/> continue to be an <unk w="effective"/> supporter <unk w="of"/> Europe 's Neighbourhood Policy and play an active <unk w="role"/> in implementing it .

<unk w="the"/> European nation has its own <unk w="tradition"/> of history and its own opportunities to <unk w="focus"/> on our common project for the benefit of the <unk w="european"/> Union .

Latvia 's duty is to make use of this special circumstance which could be lost within the <unk w="year"/> 10 <unk w="years"/> .

After several decades , <unk w="in"/> eastern eyes , Latvia will be only one of the Member <unk w="states"/> of the European Union , not the <unk w="people"/> to Europe .

<unk w="the"/> use of these advantages , Latvia will maintain an active political dialogue in order to encourage a better understanding <unk w="of"/> the European Union and its values in <unk w="the"/> neighbouring states and so clarify the goals of the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Eastern Partnership .

That is of mutual benefit , and we <unk w="are"/> <unk w="also"/> <unk w="able"/> to hear how neighbouring states perceive <unk w="the"/> future <unk w="cooperation"/> with the European Union .

I am convinced <unk w="that"/> Europe <unk w="'s"/> interests would be best <unk w="determined"/> by an early inauguration of <unk w="the"/> Eastern Partnership during the Czech Republic 's Presidency .

Ladies <unk w="and"/> gentlemen , the <unk w="field"/> of energy security has very recently become topical during the first days of the Czech Presidency .

The financial and <unk w="economic"/> crisis is cyclical in its own way .

<unk w="problems"/> associated with energy security and sustainable energy sources are , however , always on Europe 's political agenda and <unk w="one"/> of the world .

This means that this <unk w="report"/> cannot be viewed divorced from the world situation .

The recent events in Ukraine and the conflict in Georgia are proof of <unk w="it"/> .

Even quite recently , European Union Member States regarded energy as <unk w="an"/> issue to be resolved at the national and not at the European Union level .

The events of the last year in the energy sector , the interruptions to energy supply , the shrinking of energy resources and price <unk w="quantities"/> have helped to <unk w="have"/> a common understanding in European Union Member <unk w="states"/> of the need <unk w="for"/> a common <unk w="foreign"/> policy .

At the <unk w="level"/> of energy and politics , our main task <unk w="is"/> to secure a regular , sufficient , economic , <unk w="efficient"/> and environmentally friendly energy supply .

<unk w="i"/> have to admit <unk w="that"/> the European Union has had only mixed success in this <unk w="area"/> .

On some issues , of which the <unk w="creation"/> of an <unk w="industry"/> <unk w="on"/> energy economy is an example , we have adopted ambitious goals at the European level , which we must now begin <unk w="by"/> <unk w="debate"/> .

On other issues - diversification <unk w="of"/> energy <unk w="sources"/> at European level and creation of a single energy market - we are right at the beginning of our journey .

The events of the last few days , involving a cut-off of gas supplies from Russia , has <unk w="been"/> <unk w="rise"/> to the need to <unk w="make"/> the <unk w="best"/> possible <unk w="competition"/> at pan-European level .

<unk w="all"/> of <unk w="we"/> have the responsibility of applying this common understanding <unk w="and"/> create a truly integrated and diversified European energy market .

<unk w="the"/> energy security question can only be successfully resolved by <unk w="an"/> active dialogue with the transit and supplier countries for <unk w="human"/> resources .

The <unk w="european"/> Union has the foreign policy instruments to resolve this issue .

A further direction where <unk w="we"/> must make serious efforts is <unk w="the"/> integration of the Baltic energy market <unk w=","/> <unk w="the"/> Scandinavian and Central European energy markets .

Its <unk w="attempts"/> to improve energy <unk w="policy"/> and solidarity also includes the development of the interconnection <unk w="agency"/> for the Baltic energy market .

This will allow for a progressive integration of the <unk w="member"/> States <unk w="and"/> the single European energy market .

I hold Sweden 's <unk w="opinion"/> in the strategic discussions on <unk w="the"/> Baltic Sea region in high regard .

Sweden will shortly have the opportunity to put it into practice during <unk w="the"/> presidency <unk w="in"/> the second half of <unk w="the"/> year .

I am convinced that strong regions from the Mediterranean to the Baltic Sea make for a strong <unk w="european"/> Union .

Ladies <unk w="and"/> gentlemen , the initial aim of the European Union - <unk w="social"/> security and wellbeing <unk w="for"/> the people of <unk w="europe"/> - has not altered .

What has <unk w="happened"/> is the environment in which we must achieve this <unk w="objective"/> .

<unk w="the"/> global economy is much more closely linked than it was <unk w="in"/> a century <unk w="ago"/> .

<unk w="at"/> the same time , powerful new economic players <unk w="which"/> appeared on the world scene .

It is only with coherent , far-sighted <unk w="course"/> , most important of all , common action by the European Union that we can hope not to be the losers in this global competitive <unk w="market"/> .

Only together can we fulfil the promises of security and wellbeing for our <unk w="citizens"/> .

Only thus can we attain <unk w="the"/> <unk w="conditions"/> for which the <unk w="citizens"/> of our nations have cast their votes , in support <unk w="of"/> our participation in the European Union .

This is especially true of its uniform and balanced <unk w="approach"/> to the Union 's enlargement <unk w="process"/> .

Europe 's dynamic <unk w="economy"/> has given Europe the opportunity to compete <unk w="with"/> .

This growth <unk w="in"/> Europe <unk w="is"/> potential , which it must exploit , so that the Union can , even <unk w="for"/> decades from now , <unk w="be"/> an equal economic partner for <unk w="the"/> rapidly growing Asian <unk w="and"/> Latin American economies .

It is also impossible to overestimate the significance of the European Parliament in bringing the European project <unk w="closer"/> to our <unk w="citizens"/> and extending its democratic legitimacy .

In the future , the role of the European Parliament will become even <unk w="more"/> important .

<unk w="it"/> is important to unite in our multiformity and diversity .

It is important to continue working on <unk w="what"/> the European <unk w="union"/> .

That is a task that all Europeans must take on <unk w="it"/> .

It is essential <unk w="to"/> prevent <unk w="citizens"/> of <unk w="european"/> European Union .

Member States must <unk w="find"/> solutions and avoid the development of a multi-speed approach to the European project .

The agreement reached in the Council last month for the furtherance <unk w="of"/> the Lisbon Treaty is welcome .

<unk w="the"/> Lisbon Treaty is the legal precondition for the future fully effective functioning of <unk w="the"/> European Union .

How effectively the Lisbon Treaty will work in practice depends on the <unk w="political"/> will of the Member States and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> ability to unite in achieving Europe <unk w="'s"/> goals .

Ladies and gentlemen , until <unk w="now"/> , Latvia 's goal was membership of the European Union .

Since that time , we have shaped Latvia 's goals in the context <unk w="of"/> Europe 's goals .

We can define and achieve Latvia 's goals <unk w="and"/> <unk w="that"/> they match Europe 's common vision of the future .

For their part , Europe 's goals are attainable if they correspond to the <unk w="citizens"/> of every Member State .

The European Union was built and must be <unk w="accompanied"/> on a base of <unk w="european"/> values .

Only public discussion can <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> out those values that are common to all <unk w="of"/> us .

Only in unison can we agree on those <unk w="issues"/> that <unk w="we"/> are going to place <unk w="in"/> those on which the European Union was founded .

It is the task of <unk w="the"/> politicians , but especially <unk w="in"/> Europe 's leaders , to define European values and initiate discussion on them .

The post-crisis economic world will have <unk w="insight"/> into several economic power centres .

<unk w="we"/> will have the will and the ability <unk w="to"/> be united , for only union will afford <unk w="has"/> the chance to fulfil our tasks .

Moreover , the European <unk w="union"/> will still <unk w="be"/> open to all those Europeans who <unk w="communicate"/> its values .

This unity in <unk w="order"/> <unk w="will"/> be the key to the growing importance of Europe 's role in the <unk w="balkans"/> .

<unk w="skills"/> and culture will be the bridge joining the different experiences of the European Union 's <unk w="member"/> States and <unk w="it"/> will help to regain Europe 's leading <unk w="role"/> in the world in the realms of science and culture .

There will no <unk w="longer"/> be old <unk w=","/> new , small and large European nations .

<unk w="in"/> Europe , nations will <unk w="be"/> judged according to their achievements , not <unk w="the"/> geographical and geopolitical criteria .

Europe will be united , and this unity will be secured by <unk w="the"/> regions , which while defending their own <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> <unk w="and"/> work closely <unk w="together"/> with others , <unk w="and"/> <unk w="is"/> a <unk w="situation"/> of wellbeing and development throughout Europe .

Every nation <unk w="can"/> contribute to this development according <unk w="to"/> its own abilities <unk w="and"/> <unk w="their"/> knowledge .

What <unk w="can"/> be Latvia 's role in the European Union of <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> ?

Latvia <unk w="and"/> capital city , Riga , will be one of the flourishing centres of the Baltic <unk w="sea"/> region .

Latvia 's economy will be <unk w="more"/> balanced , more competitive and structurally transformed .

In 2015 , for the first time in the history of the independent state , Latvia will be entrusted with solving questions on the European and global scale as the presiding Member State of the <unk w="european"/> Union .

<unk w="our"/> contribution to Europe <unk w="and"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> our special relationships with the Eastern <unk w="european"/> nations .

<unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and our region <unk w="must"/> be <unk w="a"/> bridge to the East , just as the Mediterranean states will join both <unk w="sides"/> of that sea .

Our vision of <unk w="the"/> open Europe and our experience of <unk w="sport"/> will <unk w="be"/> <unk w="a"/> spur to Europe 's openness .

<unk w="ladies"/> and gentlemen , 2015 is not far away ; only six years stand between us .

A <unk w="year"/> ago , the Latvian <unk w="'"/> Rainis wrote : ' What changes , endures ' .

It <unk w="will"/> grow more powerful in its economy , welfare and mutual cooperation .

Europeans will be proud <unk w="that"/> they live in Europe and yet belong to their own nation .

Unity in diversity , development , preservation <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> values and every citizen <unk w="of"/> responsibility towards his or her nation and for the European family as a whole , that is <unk w="europe"/> 's future .

<unk w="ladies"/> and <unk w="gentlemen"/> , Europe 's development and prosperity is the yardstick of our success .

I call on <unk w="you"/> , as Members of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="european"/> Parliament , <unk w="to"/> encourage Europeans ' understanding of our common goals and of how they will affect the life of every European in his or her own home .

The support <unk w="of"/> European citizens for the idea of Europe is the strongest guarantee of Europe 's future .

I <unk w="wish"/> you success in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="preparatory"/> work and in the next European Parliament elections .

Mr President , may I thank <unk w="you"/> on behalf of the <unk w="european"/> Parliament <unk w="for"/> your address , for your European courageousness and for your European determination .

We were of course glad to hear <unk w="what"/> you value the European Parliament , and rightly so .

I still remember very clearly that , during accession negotiations in the second half of <unk w="the"/> 1990s , Latvia , Lithuania and Slovakia were initially excluded .

It was the European Parliament that called on the governments to include Latvia , Lithuania <unk w="and"/> Slovakia in the negotiations .

As a result , Latvia , Lithuania <unk w="and"/> <unk w="denmark"/> were able <unk w="to"/> become members of the European Union on 1 May 2004 .

You addressed the energy question and I shall reply to you very <unk w="briefly"/> .

<unk w="we"/> have a very responsible Commissioner , a compatriot of yours , Andris Piebalgs , who acquitted himself admirably last week and during the gas dispute with Russia and Ukraine , but especially with Russia .

I should like to thank Andris <unk w="rapporteur"/> for his work in the presence of his President .

Yet even those <unk w="who"/> belonged to the <unk w="european"/> Community , to <unk w="the"/> European Union , from the beginning are learning from you and your historical experiences .

If we are prepared to listen to each <unk w="other"/> and to learn from each other , then we shall all be the better for it .

On the basis of our common values , we are <unk w="concerned"/> , democratic and <unk w="democratic"/> .

Thank you , President Zatlers , it was a joy <unk w="to"/> welcome you <unk w="and"/> <unk w="it"/> .

( CS ) Madam President , I welcome the compromise , which will force governments of <unk w="third"/> countries to <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> a timetable and draw <unk w="up"/> <unk w="horizontal"/> plans to limit risks from the use of pesticides .

The restrictions on spraying by aircraft will surely be welcomed by EU citizens , as will the buffer zones for protecting drinking water <unk w="and"/> aquatic organisms .

I voted for the directive <unk w="and"/> it is in line with my views on <unk w="consumer"/> protection .

Madam President , I voted in favour of <unk w="the"/> compromise <unk w="because"/> it makes sense that <unk w="we"/> have sustainable use of pesticides .

I think the real <unk w="problem"/> <unk w="is"/> that there <unk w="are"/> such different rules across Member States : <unk w="developing"/> countries apply training and education of operators <unk w="in"/> a very strict way and , therefore , have good <unk w="for"/> use of pesticides , but not all countries do so .

I think this piece of legislation will make <unk w="it"/> appropriate that we have higher standards across the European Union .

That is <unk w="why"/> both for those who operate <unk w=","/> and for those who <unk w="come"/> into contact with <unk w="them"/> .

I think we are talking about a very sensible package here , so I was very happy to <unk w="support"/> it , and I congratulate the rapporteur .

There is no question that we need a regulatory system for <unk w="consumers"/> .

Interestingly , while there was a very vexed debate on hazard-versus-risk on the Breyer <unk w="report"/> , I have <unk w="therefore"/> felt that this issue is more suitable to the actual use as distinct from placing <unk w="on"/> the market - in other words , this <unk w="afternoon"/> .

A wide range of common products can be hazardous if the handling <unk w="of"/> usage instructions are ignored .

<unk w="placing"/> on the market in itself is not a risk <unk w="to"/> the consumer , <unk w="the"/> environment or the user of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="""/> .

Pesticides are only <unk w="possible"/> if the handler does <unk w="not"/> know what <unk w="he"/> or she is doing , if the application equipment is faulty , if the aquatic environment is ignored or if they are improperly stored and not part of an integrated pest-management plan .

The concept of <unk w="the"/> use reduction needs <unk w="to"/> management , as less frequent <unk w=","/> with higher concentration <unk w=","/> pesticide could result .

At the end of the day , these substances must <unk w="be"/> used to the least <unk w="one"/> possible , as every farmer knows .

I supported the new regulation because in my <unk w="view"/> it constitutes a tool for <unk w="a"/> new and safer <unk w="for"/> <unk w="for"/> <unk w="these"/> plants .

I consider the mutual recognition of approved pesticides according to <unk w="which"/> zones to be a positive achievement for our Parliament .

The preparation of a list of banned <unk w="substances"/> is also a step forward - these include carcinogens , genotoxic substances <unk w="and"/> also substances <unk w=","/> <unk w="adult"/> and immunotoxic effects - and is based on scientific knowledge .

As the Commissioner <unk w="said"/> <unk w="said"/> , it seems that it applies to a relatively small percentage of the substances <unk w="being"/> used today .

I would like to mention that we must apply these <unk w="measures"/> strictly to imported <unk w="products"/> <unk w="as"/> well .

Commissioner , I also wanted to <unk w="have"/> a say on other reports but I was not given the floor .

These reports have already been used for explanatory purposes or they have already been <unk w="mentioned"/> here , so I believe they will be adopted in their written form .

Since I <unk w="have"/> a child there has been one vegetable that I hate : peas .

I agree with the aims of the legislation to promote <unk w="the"/> health of our environment , the health of us as individuals , but it really potentially threatens a huge agricultural industry in my region .

After much soul-searching , I have abstained , but I wish to make it clear that I think our legislative procedure <unk w="in"/> this respect was flawed .

We had so much information at the end - conflicting and <unk w="simple"/> - that I , and I <unk w="have"/> many others , would have welcomed the possibility <unk w="of"/> a third reading , or of conciliation , to make sure that we have protected all interests .

Madam <unk w="president"/> , I too found this a particularly difficult decision .

I felt that the report was , in general , very well-balanced and constructive , and it was certainly designed to ensure a high level of protection for human health , <unk w="public"/> health and the environment .

However , I have concerns about <unk w="a"/> situation where we are making decisions for approval of a particular substance based on whether that substance is a hazard or not , <unk w="but"/> we <unk w="are"/> not taking possible exposure into account .

One of <unk w="these"/> concerns is that , <unk w="when"/> I talk to citizens about the EU , one of the issues they <unk w="will"/> raise with me is that , at times , the EU 's legislation is not always proportionate .

While I believe there is flexibility in this report , I think we needed a little <unk w="more"/> , but crucially we needed further scientific evidence to support <unk w="this"/> case .

Yes , there is the precautionary principle , and we need to be mindful of this , but decisions also need to be evidence-based , <unk w="and"/> I would have liked a little more evidence in <unk w="this"/> matter .

Whilst <unk w="the"/> protection of the environment and safeguarding of public health go hand-in-hand , I believe we have to balance the <unk w="interests"/> of consumers and producers .

I <unk w="have"/> met with a number of experts and farmers and <unk w="their"/> representatives in <unk w="the"/> West Midlands constituency who all have deep reservations about the effects that this report will have on crop yields .

My biggest worry is that there has not been a proper impact assessment by the Commission and there is no <unk w="clear"/> indication of <unk w="how"/> this report will mean for agriculture .

At a time of rising food prices around the world , I do not think <unk w="that"/> now is the time for us to have a knee-jerk reaction to introduce <unk w="legislation"/> which may have adverse effects on food production .

That is why my delegation introduced an amendment for a thorough <unk w="and"/> long overdue impact assessment .

Madam President , like other colleagues , I should like to <unk w="say"/> that this <unk w="is"/> a very difficult dossier .

Overall , however , I believe <unk w="that"/> what we voted on is a much better proposal and <unk w="more"/> than the original one on the table - and I compliment those <unk w="who"/> worked on <unk w="it"/> .

Let me say a few things about this - <unk w="and"/> I will end up with the key <unk w="points"/> .

I think we are now in a position where farmers need to lobby the agrochemical industry to produce safer alternatives so that they can continue to produce food , and I think <unk w="that"/> <unk w="renewable"/> energy <unk w="will"/> go into that <unk w=","/> as has gone heretofore .

When it comes <unk w="to"/> food imports , the Commission need <unk w="to"/> <unk w="address"/> the <unk w="main"/> concerns of EU farmers and producers that they will be banned from using certain substances but third countries <unk w="will"/> <unk w="not"/> <unk w="to"/> them .

Madam President , I voted against this simply because the proposal has been hijacked in effect by the Committee <unk w="on"/> the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety and Commissioners .

The rapporteurs yesterday boasted about standardisation , and yet this is allegedly a Union <unk w="of"/> diversity .

This was essentially an agricultural issue , <unk w="and"/> the Danish Commissioner <unk w=","/> <unk w="there"/> was nowhere to be seen at any time , and that is a disgrace .

The reason , of course , is because of a conflict of interests <unk w="and"/> the Danes fail to process their drinking water after it <unk w="is"/> out of the ground .

Farmers in my <unk w="parts"/> of the world feel totally let down and frankly insulted by <unk w="the"/> fact that <unk w="we"/> <unk w="are"/> some assumptions here that they do not know what they are doing , and they <unk w="need"/> to be told .

Essentially you have added <unk w="to"/> another group to those in the UK who frankly loathe the European Union 's <unk w="reputation"/> .

Madam President , exaggerated claims have <unk w="been"/> made and fears expressed <unk w="by"/> all sides on this report .

It is has been difficult to distinguish fact from fiction and <unk w="i"/> come to a decision on <unk w="access"/> to <unk w="us"/> .

While I recognise the concerns of the soft fruit industry , <unk w="the"/> potato industry and the cereal farmers in Ireland who have spoken to <unk w="talk"/> about this , I supported the compromise .

I supported the vote as , <unk w="in"/> my opinion , the worst of all outcomes would be to deliver this report to <unk w="us"/> .

Madam President , I think that , when one considers the European project , <unk w="there"/> is a dialectic at its heart .

We talk about democracy , yet we ignore the democratic will as expressed in referenda in France , the Netherlands and <unk w="denmark"/> .

We talk about <unk w="the"/> <unk w="safety"/> and farmers in poorer countries , yet there will now be , as a result of this vote , a <unk w="proposal"/> to ban imports from farmers who <unk w="are"/> used pesticides that are now banned in the European Union .

I simply have a plea to my colleagues <unk w="to"/> Parliament and to the Commission : Please , let us think in future about the <unk w="social"/> consequences of our legislation .

I <unk w="warmly"/> <unk w="congratulate"/> Mrs Wallis about the legislative <unk w="procedure"/> and that there should have been a third reading .

I agree it has been <unk w="going"/> through and I think we all <unk w="know"/> <unk w="that"/> there has been an insufficient impact assessment on a scientific basis .

Madam President , I <unk w="want"/> to undermine the compromise by voting against those parts of this report .

I will <unk w="be"/> <unk w="this"/> by reading <unk w="it"/> a letter to me from James Mowbray , who is a farmer near Skegness in my <unk w="country"/> .

He said , ' I have personally been involved <unk w="in"/> the application of crop protection <unk w=","/> for over 40 years .

I have always applied products with a sensitive approach <unk w="to"/> <unk w="to"/> human beings as well as wildlife .

I therefore find it distressing that the possible withdrawal of many products , <unk w="in"/> the triazole <unk w="agreement"/> , is based on less than scientific arguments and will make <unk w="more"/> business not particularly viable and <unk w="to"/> the availability of home-produced food ' .

I received these comments from him and from literally hundreds of other people , from Empire World Trade , based in Spalding in Lincolnshire , <unk w="the"/> Manby in Parker Farms in Leicester , John Clark , who is <unk w=","/> in <unk w="fact"/> , Jonathan Reading and hundreds more names .

Madam President , now <unk w="that"/> this vote is over and the arguments <unk w="have"/> been made , I would like to come back to something that ran through the debate here <unk w="today"/> in the committee .

Farmers in Ireland <unk w="too"/> , and <unk w="has"/> been , stewards who for thousands <unk w="of"/> years have protected and preserved the environment , keeping it alive , clean and productive .

Similarly , farmers have also <unk w="recognised"/> the basis of <unk w="this"/> <unk w="situation"/> .

They produce the good food that is the basis of our good <unk w="intentions"/> .

I would <unk w="urge"/> you to renew our faith in our farmers , who <unk w="are"/> doing their best to feed us in very difficult situations , circumstances of weather , <unk w="problems"/> and , of course , EU policy .

in <unk w="europe"/> . - We <unk w="have"/> just voted on an agreement for civil aviation <unk w="industry"/> .

Although travel <unk w="of"/> air is one of the <unk w="best"/> means of travel , however , one can never take measures which are too safe .

Since <unk w="this"/> horrendous terror attack <unk w="on"/> the twin towers , innumerable security <unk w="that"/> have been put in place .

Just <unk w="on"/> the issue of safety one can never be <unk w="to"/> secure .

Indeed , it <unk w="is"/> when we feel too secure that <unk w="it"/> strikes again .

Of <unk w="course"/> , one has to find a balance between civil liberties and rights and security measures ; however , when it comes down to a choice one has to prioritise .

<unk w="for"/> instance , there has been a substantial deal of <unk w="attention"/> to the sharing of passenger lists on the basis of data protection .

But surely such security <unk w="policy"/> will enable an in-depth analysis not possible <unk w="by"/> the frontiers .

Innocent civilians are purposely targeted and the civilians <unk w="of"/> <unk w="third"/> countries preselected .

<unk w="in"/> such an environment <unk w=","/> we are <unk w="not"/> expecting these countries to abstain from doing all that which is <unk w="important"/> to protect the interests of its citizens .

I voted in favour of this report because the aviation <unk w="industry"/> in Romania will benefit directly too .

The negotiated agreement <unk w="signed"/> by and large the structure <unk w="of"/> a conventional aviation safety agreement ; it <unk w="is"/> based on mutual <unk w="support"/> in each other 's systems and on the comparison of regulatory differences .

This entails obligations and methods for cooperation between exporting and importing <unk w="countries"/> .

However , the means of achieving this <unk w="objective"/> , namely cooperation and mutual acceptance of each other 's certification findings in the areas of airworthiness and maintenance , are set out in the annexes <unk w="in"/> <unk w="s"/> agreement , unlike in conventional agreements , where these measures are usually set out in separate non-binding agreements at civil aviation authority level .

The annexes broadly reflect the content of the Community 's <unk w="community"/> Rules on airworthiness ( Commission Regulation No 1702 / 2003 ) <unk w="on"/> maintenance ( Commission Regulation No 2042 / <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> ) to be modified by the parties based on a decision of the Bilateral Oversight Board .

The origins of the aviation agreements between the European Community and the United States ( US ) <unk w=","/> in and are <unk w="to"/> <unk w="to"/> the liberalisation of air transport .

These agreements established at EU level ( <unk w="or"/> rather , by the <unk w="european"/> Community - the only body that exists in law - and its single <unk w="market"/> <unk w="market"/> , which they intend to fully liberalise ) are meant to prevail over <unk w="the"/> bilateral agreements established between various Member States <unk w="in"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="union"/> .

As in other resolutions previously adopted by the <unk w="european"/> Parliament , we would highlight that we are obviously the first to be interested in <unk w="developing"/> a ' high level of <unk w="european"/> aviation safety ' and measures ' to minimize <unk w="economic"/> burdens <unk w="in"/> the aviation industry and <unk w="students"/> from redundant <unk w="the"/> oversight ' .

However , we <unk w="must"/> safeguard two important aspects : ( 1 ) the objective and presumed basis of these processes must not <unk w="be"/> to create and <unk w="create"/> the conditions for increasing the liberalisation of air transport , through the harmonisation of standards ; ( 2 ) these processes must not promote harmonisation through a lowering of safety standards and rules , in particular where , when safety , minimisation of burdens and liberalisation are mixed together , it is profit and concentration that prevail .

We <unk w="cannot"/> <unk w="that"/> air transport must <unk w="be"/> defended as a public service , provided by public companies in <unk w="the"/> country , which guarantee quality and safety in the services <unk w="available"/> to citizens .

I agree in principle with Paolo Costa 's report on civil <unk w="society"/> .

It <unk w="is"/> important for the EU and the US to agree on a <unk w="budget"/> line with the help of this agreement .

<unk w="in"/> the event of contempt <unk w="for"/> the <unk w="possibility"/> of either the EU or the US , a rescindable variation in the <unk w="future"/> will be <unk w="used"/> .

I voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a Council <unk w="decision"/> on the conclusion of an Agreement between the European Community and the <unk w="united"/> <unk w="states"/> of America on cooperation in the regulation <unk w="on"/> civil aviation safety .

I agree with the <unk w="commission"/> 's proposal on the conclusion of this agreement .

I think that the objectives of the <unk w="treaty"/> , namely facilitation of trade in the goods and services covered by the agreement , maximum <unk w="harmonisation"/> of the duplication of assessments , tests <unk w="and"/> controls to <unk w="national"/> regulatory differences and use of the certification system of either party to check conformity with the requirements of <unk w="any"/> other party are legitimate objectives .

I hope that the <unk w="debate"/> on mutual trust of the <unk w="socialist"/> party 's <unk w="party"/> will favour <unk w="the"/> implementation of this agreement .

As the European Parliament 's <unk w="proposal"/> for <unk w="the"/> legislative report <unk w="on"/> the expansion of the European Aviation <unk w="safety"/> Agency 's ( EASA ) powers , I welcome the <unk w="cooperation"/> agreement with the United States on facilitating mutual acceptance of civil aviation safety certificates .

This agreement marks <unk w="an"/> important step <unk w="towards"/> expanding transatlantic cooperation , which is a priority <unk w="one"/> <unk w="in"/> the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats .

It establishes sound conditions for boosting trade in goods and services in the civil aviation sector <unk w="in"/> the European Union and the United <unk w="states"/> , which undoubtedly benefits Europe .

The agreement offers <unk w="no"/> guarantees as regards safety and <unk w="monitoring"/> of the compatibility of products , components and aircraft with the increased <unk w="objective"/> of protecting the environment .

In <unk w="these"/> conditions , we can hope that the European Single Sky <unk w="agenda"/> will be extended <unk w="to"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="right"/> to <unk w="contribute"/> to transatlantic cooperation and that cooperation will be widened in the field of research , as well as the implementation of new technologies in this field , based on collaboration between SESAR and <unk w="women"/> .

I believe that this agreement will facilitate in the long <unk w="term"/> <unk w="the"/> mutually beneficial extension of <unk w="the"/> cooperation framework between the EASA and the FAA , from which airlines , the aviation industry and , more significantly , passengers will directly benefit .

The future of the external transport policy requires <unk w="good"/> relations between the European Community and the United States .

As a result , <unk w="one"/> of the <unk w="key"/> points of this cooperation agreement on the regulation of civil aviation safety is mutual trust in each other 's systems and the <unk w="lack"/> of regulatory differences .

The objective of this agreement is <unk w="to"/> facilitate trade in goods and <unk w="services"/> in the aviation sector , by limiting as much as possible the <unk w="impact"/> <unk w="of"/> assessments , tests and controls to significant regulatory differences between the two parties .

We therefore believe that a framework is being created which will work smoothly on a daily basis and which will allow technical issues arising <unk w="for"/> its implementation to be solved through a system <unk w="of"/> continual cooperation and consultation .

<unk w="mr"/> President , <unk w="ladies"/> and gentlemen , I would <unk w="like"/> to <unk w="say"/> that I voted in favour of Mr Costa 's report on the conclusion of the agreement between the European Community and the United States of America on cooperation in <unk w="the"/> regulation of civil aviation safety , as set out in the proposal for a Council decision .

I concur with the rapporteur in considering that Parliament must declare itself in favour of the conclusion of the agreement because this would clearly streamline the trade in goods <unk w="and"/> services between the parties in the <unk w="telecommunications"/> and maintenance sector , avoiding the redundant duplication of assessments and checks on compliance with safety requirements , which until now have had to be repeated <unk w="and"/> if they are very <unk w="reluctant"/> to one another .

I believe , however , that the agreement should be applied provisionally at first , so that we can identify any <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> implementation difficulties and remove them before proceeding to final approval .

I voted in favour of this report for better legal regulation of companies <unk w="in"/> the EU .

I voted in favour <unk w="of"/> the report <unk w="on"/> the common system of taxation applicable to mergers , divisions , partial divisions , transfers of assets and exchanges of shares concerning companies of different Member States <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="financial"/> transactions result in fundamental changes to commercial companies ' legal status .

I also supported <unk w="it"/> because I <unk w="am"/> a lawyer and I <unk w="am"/> <unk w="like"/> to support in the European Parliament every effort made to harmonise and codify at European level fiscal , <unk w="cooperation"/> , civil and criminal regulations .

I <unk w="am"/> in favour of this report as <unk w="the"/> Rules of Procedure of the <unk w="court"/> of First Instance lack <unk w="of"/> provision as to the language required to <unk w="be"/> used in appeal proceedings ( against decisions of the Civil Service Tribunal ) .

There is , in fact , <unk w="an"/> equivalent to Article 110 of the Rules of Procedure of <unk w="the"/> Court of Justice .

Madam President , following the last <unk w="stockholm"/> conflict in <unk w="the"/> Balkans , European states made widely differing statements on <unk w="this"/> subject .

However , by its active engagement in the situation which existed , the EU confirmed that the <unk w="negotiations"/> are an <unk w="enlarged"/> region for us and are an integral part <unk w="of"/> Europe .

We are <unk w="also"/> <unk w="trying"/> to <unk w="help"/> these countries in their <unk w="attempts"/> to achieve stability and full democracy .

I endorsed <unk w="the"/> Belder report because it underlines the need to assist the <unk w="member"/> states , while treating them as <unk w="well"/> , independent partners .

Furthermore , it is good that the report underlines the need to establish a common energy <unk w="policy"/> .

The diversification of sources is <unk w="therefore"/> needed , and this would benefit not only the EU , but the whole of Europe .

<unk w="in"/> writing . - <unk w="the"/> report by Mr Belder considers the current situation of the European Union <unk w="through"/> trade <unk w="and"/> economic relations with this increasingly stable region , where many countries <unk w="are"/> candidateship for EU membership .

The EU 's strength <unk w="as"/> an economic partner , but also as a model for a strong civil society , government and dynamic institutions , should be used to <unk w="compensate"/> for the development of the region .

A threefold and differentiated approach , taking into account the <unk w="huge"/> differences between countries in the region as well as association agreements and further support , provides a clear way to address issues of underdevelopment and shore <unk w=","/> intensive regional and <unk w="local"/> economic cooperation .

<unk w="as"/> a means of cementing a lasting peace <unk w=","/> promoting <unk w="the"/> ideals to which we are all committed , I support Mr Belder <unk w="'s"/> report .

I know the Belder report only <unk w="to"/> <unk w="both"/> the economic and commercial relationships with <unk w="the"/> Western Balkans and the evident need for the European Union to assist in their reconstruction , in the economic , legal , political and social <unk w="dialogue"/> .

I am surprised , though , that , despite the statement that this aid , as <unk w="well"/> as <unk w="the"/> accession processes , must be <unk w="defined"/> and adapted to each country , the report <unk w="does"/> not really take into account the specific situation of each country .

Above all , this Parliament , always quick to condemn violations of <unk w="human"/> rights around the <unk w="union"/> <unk w="and"/> to demand ' human rights ' clauses in international cooperation agreements , has achieved the master stroke of voting for a report on the Balkans without once mentioning the dramatic and inadmissible situation of the Serb populations in Kosovo , who have become pariahs <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="palestinian"/> land of <unk w="the"/> fathers .

Meanwhile , it congratulates itself on the hundreds of millions <unk w="of"/> euros given to the authorities who provoke , organise or tolerate this situation .

The consolidation <unk w="of"/> economic relations with the Western Balkans is of immense importance both to the EU and to the Western Balkans .

I therefore welcome the fact that the European Parliament is working intensively on this issue and that we adopted <unk w="the"/> Belder report today .

<unk w="in"/> light of the fact that the future of the countries of the Western Balkans <unk w=","/> with the EU , their economic and political rapprochement to the EU is very important .

In order to tie these countries to the EU in the long term , the development of their market economies <unk w=","/> <unk w="closer"/> cooperation must be fostered .

<unk w="that"/> is why constructive and positive signals from the European Parliament are also important .

It is in the interests <unk w="of"/> the EU to champion the creation of political stability , legal security and hence good <unk w="living"/> conditions in these countries for foreign investment .

The Belder report <unk w="addresses"/> the fact that the level of economic relations depends on progress in each <unk w="individual"/> country .

Moreover , it should be <unk w="the"/> <unk w="commission"/> 's objective <unk w="to"/> diversify the national economies of the <unk w="reconstruction"/> of the Western Balkans .

I am convinced that a positive development in economic relations between the EU and the Western Balkans will be <unk w="of"/> benefit to all countries on the continent <unk w="of"/> <unk w=","/> and I await the implementation of our proposals with anticipation .

Madam President , <unk w="ladies"/> and gentlemen , I voted in favour of the report by Mr Belder on trade and economic relations with the Western Balkans .

I would nevertheless like to emphasise the <unk w="need"/> for the Union to <unk w="conduct"/> an in-depth analysis of the situation <unk w="with"/> regard to respect for human rights <unk w="and"/> democratic principles within each country .

I refer in <unk w="particular"/> to <unk w="parliament"/> and the numerous Italian expatriates who continue to be clearly discriminated against in <unk w="that"/> country , despite Croatia 's official application for admission to the EU .

This aspect is , in my opinion , at odds with the situation of Serbia , a <unk w="country"/> that has only been granted the <unk w="possibility"/> of potential candidate and to which the Union should be more <unk w="effective"/> than it has been until now .

I voted for this report on trade <unk w="and"/> economic relations with the Western Balkans as the motion for a European Parliament resolution also includes the opinion <unk w="of"/> the Committee on Foreign Affairs and that of the Committee on <unk w="the"/> Development of which I am a member .

Economic <unk w="growth"/> and development in the Western Balkans region will provide <unk w="an"/> <unk w="opportunity"/> for constructive partnerships with <unk w="the"/> EU 's eastern <unk w="european"/> <unk w="and"/> , which ultimately includes Romania too .

At the same time , linking the economic and trade <unk w="policies"/> of the countries in the Western Balkans to the European Union <unk w=","/> <unk w="we"/> <unk w="to"/> support the stabilisation and association agreements signed between the EU and <unk w="third"/> countries .

I voted in favour of this report because economic stability may also lead to political stability in <unk w="this"/> area , which has been <unk w="very"/> troubled over the years .

The EU should use all available means in <unk w="order"/> to <unk w="help"/> the Western Balkans region and persuade it to carry out essential reforms .

Extensive and stable economic contacts between particular countries would lead <unk w="to"/> specific economic integration , which would definitely help to limit the threat of conflict <unk w="in"/> the future .

The Balkans <unk w="has"/> <unk w="have"/> made huge advances on the road to rapprochement with the <unk w="eu"/> , <unk w="and"/> the prospect of <unk w="this"/> will most certainly encourage <unk w="them"/> to continue their efforts at integration with the Community .

Therefore the introduction of changes , which should be as far-reaching as possible <unk w=","/> which would make the movement of people easier , is very <unk w="important"/> , as also is <unk w="the"/> <unk w="case"/> for the region 's young people .

Only if the people of the Balkans feel that <unk w="we"/> have equal rights with the other citizens of Europe will we be able to say that we have achieved success .

The stabilisation <unk w="and"/> association agreements , <unk w="free"/> trade preferences and technical and financial support are the three pillars on the basis of <unk w="which"/> the EU hopes to bring stability to <unk w="the"/> region .

It is true that the level <unk w="of"/> development and adoption of the acquis communautaire is not the same in <unk w="all"/> the countries of that region , and so , in defiance of having a single strategy , it is necessary to choose specific approaches , <unk w="which"/> <unk w="must"/> be tailored <unk w="to"/> the needs in question .

The progress of the accession negotiations ( or their opening in the case of potential candidate countries ) with the Western Balkan states should , obviously , depend on full compliance with <unk w="the"/> Copenhagen criteria and unconditional respect for the principles of democracy and human rights .

Let it <unk w="be"/> clear , though , that all those countries have a future in the <unk w="union"/> and that their membership will ensure that the dreadful conflicts <unk w="will"/> have typified <unk w="the"/> region for centuries are now a thing of the past .

The European Union has played an immensely important role in the process of economic and political <unk w="integration"/> of the countries of <unk w="the"/> former Yugoslavia .

However , it has undertaken an enormous responsibility with <unk w="regard"/> to the whole of the Western Balkans .

In connection with this , <unk w="the"/> EU is currently faced with the difficult task of reconstruction of the entire region .

<unk w="the"/> EU <unk w="has"/> become <unk w="the"/> main trading partner of all the <unk w="countries"/> in the Western Balkans .

The three most important pillars of <unk w="european"/> cooperation are : stabilisation agreements , trade preferences , and technical and financial support .

The process <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> should above all be directed at raising the living standard and ensuring permanent <unk w="sustainable"/> development in the Balkan states .

<unk w="in"/> undertaking its actions , however , the EU <unk w="should"/> bear in mind the membership of some of the countries in the EU and the status of <unk w="the"/> others as <unk w="the"/> candidates for membership .

It is difficult not to agree with the <unk w="idea"/> that a basic <unk w="requirement"/> for development of the countries under discussion is membership of the World Trade Organization ( Croatia , Albania and <unk w="the"/> former Yugoslavia are already members ) .

While appreciating the progress already made in terms of modernisation <unk w="in"/> the region , full integration of the Western Balkans with the EU <unk w="rail"/> system should be pursued .

in writing . - ( SV ) The report on <unk w="the"/> common agricultural policy and global food <unk w="safety"/> discusses important issues such as the consequences <unk w="of"/> rising food prices <unk w="in"/> poor and rich countries and the importance of securing <unk w="access"/> to food for everyone .

We <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> Social Democrats decided to vote against the report , as it contains problematic wordings in relation to agricultural policy .

Among other <unk w="things"/> , we would <unk w="like"/> to see a <unk w="reduction"/> in the proportion of the EU budget allocated to agricultural policy , the retention and <unk w="implementation"/> of cross-compliance and the <unk w="dissemination"/> <unk w="of"/> the system to the market .

in writing . - Securing sustainable food supply <unk w="is"/> one <unk w="of"/> the greatest challenges that <unk w="enable"/> us .

This <unk w="directive"/> will continue to grow as the world 's population expands .

The <unk w="civilian"/> population growth <unk w="there"/> is over 70 million per year .

This <unk w="means"/> providing food for 70 million more people every year .

How <unk w="will"/> we manage this when <unk w=","/> over 850 million people in the world are undernourished ?

While securing sustainable food supply is one of our greatest challenges , the EU is one of the greatest success stories of recent times , <unk w="has"/> brought peace , stability and prosperity <unk w="in"/> the region .

The EU is the largest <unk w="side"/> of ODA <unk w=","/> is a model for <unk w="international"/> cooperation , <unk w="we"/> can put this experience to good use globally .

The EU cannot afford to follow policy lines that are narrow <unk w="and"/> scope .

Just as international fortunes are intertwined , there is more and more overlap <unk w="in"/> policy areas .

<unk w="this"/> report is an acknowledgment of this <unk w="is"/> a recognition that the EU 's high standards <unk w="of"/> wealth of agricultural experience can be of a wider value in addressing global <unk w="social"/> security , including <unk w="by"/> providing funding for fertilisers and high-yield seeds , as well as training and practical support for farmers <unk w="and"/> food producers .

in writing . - ( DA ) Anne E. Jensen and <unk w="i"/> <unk w="we"/> have voted in favour of Mrs McGuinness 's own-initiative report on the common agricultural policy and global food security , as the majority of the <unk w="committee"/> is excellent and <unk w="it"/> is only possible to vote either in favour or against .

However , we cannot <unk w="accept"/> paragraphs 63 and 64 , which raise doubts about free trade in <unk w="tobacco"/> products .

We are strong supporters of free trade and believe <unk w="that"/> it <unk w="is"/> absolutely right to work to bring about a situation in which trade <unk w="and"/> agricultural products is based on <unk w="significant"/> market principles .

in writing . - ( DA ) <unk w="the"/> Danish Members of the Socialist <unk w="group"/> in the European Parliament have voted against the own-initiative report <unk w="on"/> the common <unk w="fisheries"/> policy and global food security , as the report opposes the liberalisation of agricultural policy and criticises EU rules on the restriction of <unk w="gmos"/> .

<unk w="i"/> believe it is necessary to <unk w="guarantee"/> balanced access to <unk w="the"/> global food supply , but that <unk w="it"/> will not be helped by either maintaining or extending the EU 's agricultural aid .

The global food problem is increasing rather than shrinking and affects all grassroots <unk w="classes"/> , not only in the less developed countries , but also in the more developed countries .

The main <unk w="purpose"/> of this situation is that the basic criterion <unk w="of"/> the production of agricultural produce and food is profit rather than global food requirements .

The trading of foodstuffs on international exchanges has resulted in spiralling price increases and , hence , spiralling profits for the food multinationals , a perceptible <unk w="increase"/> in rural <unk w="areas"/> and global food reserves and an increase <unk w="in"/> the number of malnourished people .

In order to address this unacceptable <unk w="situation"/> , which condemns one billion people to malnourishment and starvation , the report confines itself to <unk w="european"/> lists which are cancelled out by <unk w="the"/> insistence on abiding by the same <unk w="token"/> : support for the common agricultural policy and its reviews and ' <unk w="the"/> <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> ' , the completion of negotiations in the World Trade Organization , the decoupling of aid from production and the continuing production <unk w="of"/> biofuels , on the <unk w="protection"/> of the environment and using land which could be used to produce food .

It barely touches <unk w="on"/> the principles of food sovereignty <unk w="and"/> security and the right to self-sufficiency <unk w="in"/> food .

The MEPs from the Communist Party of <unk w="greece"/> voted against the report because , despite its <unk w="'"/> and ' wishes ' , it supports the anti-grassroots , pro-monopoly policy <unk w="which"/> is condemning more and more people to malnourishment and starvation .

in writing . - ( <unk w="sv"/> ) It <unk w="is"/> <unk w="not"/> <unk w="when"/> we combat and alleviate starvation .

In <unk w="this"/> respect , I welcome the content <unk w="of"/> Mrs McGuinness 's own-initiative report on the common agricultural policy and global food security .

I have , <unk w="therefore"/> , <unk w="referred"/> to abstain , <unk w="in"/> the report <unk w="is"/> strongly protectionist in places .

A freer world market for agricultural products would make it easier for people in poor countries to develop their <unk w="lives"/> .

We are seeing this now <unk w="in"/> large parts of Africa , in particular .

We <unk w="agree"/> with various aspects highlighted by the report , in particular :

the fact that the policy shift has resulted in a <unk w="new"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="of"/> market opportunities for EU producers and has led to increased reliance on imported food <unk w="from"/> outside the European Union , produced to very different <unk w="member"/> <unk w="and"/> , thereby placing <unk w="more"/> agricultural products at a disadvantage ;

the concern that dramatic increases in agricultural production costs may result <unk w="in"/> less <unk w="co2"/> and reduced output , which <unk w="would"/> exacerbate the food crisis in Europe and the world ;

the concern about increasing market concentration <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="large"/> retail sector , which has led to the development of monopolies , and the need for alternative solutions in negotiations with <unk w="us"/> , in favour of small farmers .

However , there are also aspects <unk w="on"/> which we <unk w="all"/> agree :

<unk w="the"/> increased orientation of the common agricultural policy towards the market and the devaluation of <unk w="national"/> sovereignty , with the emphasis solely being placed on food security , forgetting that this is difficult without food sovereignty .

The McGuinness report tackles an issue that I regard as strategic : food security and the <unk w="dignity"/> of strong and competitive <unk w="european"/> agriculture in a globalised world .

Following the recent <unk w="crisis"/> in food prices , food security <unk w="must"/> be an EU priority .

Despite the <unk w="fact"/> that another food shortage crisis <unk w="does"/> not <unk w="only"/> <unk w="in"/> the short term , it is likely that one will <unk w=","/> in the future , if we take into account <unk w="the"/> negative effects of climate change on agricultural production <unk w="and"/> the constantly increasing demand .

Bearing in mind that developing countries will probably not be able to produce food in sufficient quantities to supply their <unk w="local"/> populations , the industrialised countries will continue to have the <unk w="priority"/> task of producing and exporting food .

The common agricultural policy must therefore once again become a <unk w="new"/> priority and form the basis of the European food security policy , given that , in a time of financial and economic crisis , it is more important than ever .

The Dutch People 's Party for <unk w="democracy"/> and <unk w="party"/> ( VVD ) delegation has <unk w="voted"/> in favour of the McGuinness <unk w="of"/> <unk w="of"/> the common agricultural policy and global food security , despite the fact <unk w="that"/> it disapproves of some of the content <unk w="of"/> this report .

The <unk w="socialist"/> delegation would have liked to have seen the report <unk w="to"/> <unk w="ensure"/> that the barriers to trade in the developing <unk w="countries"/> <unk w="should"/> be phased out with reciprocity .

Alongside <unk w="this"/> , it would have liked the <unk w="commission"/> to have argued in favour of a <unk w="new"/> , faster procedure for the authorisation of cisgenic products .

in writing . - The McGuinness report deals with issues of <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> <unk w="particular"/> importance .

In two years world food <unk w="chain"/> have increased by over 80 % and cereal stocks <unk w="have"/> fallen to dangerously low levels .

Pressure on global food stocks are also coming from relatively new sources such as the <unk w="road"/> towards increased use of bio-fuels .

I welcome the general thrust of this report <unk w="and"/> , accordingly , voted <unk w="in"/> favour .

<unk w="mr"/> President , I voted in favour of adopting the report by Mrs McGuinness , but I would like <unk w="to"/> draw attention to <unk w="the"/> following issues in particular .

For <unk w="the"/> first time since the 1970s , <unk w="which"/> <unk w="has"/> been facing an <unk w="important"/> worldwide food crisis .

This crisis actually began before the present <unk w="european"/> economic crisis , at a time when world maize and wheat prices skyrocketed in a very <unk w="high"/> <unk w="way"/> .

The food crisis may have changed its name to <unk w="the"/> crisis , but the former has unfortunately not gone <unk w="through"/> .

It is dreadful <unk w="to"/> think that , even before the problems posed by the current food crisis , around a billion people worldwide suffered <unk w="by"/> chronic <unk w="age"/> and malnutrition .

We cannot tolerate a situation where , while worldwide <unk w=","/> increases and <unk w="the"/> price of food soars , we in Europe are <unk w="closing"/> down agriculture drastically and for the oddest of reasons .

In Finland , as in the other Member States , people must have the right <unk w="to"/> engage in profitable <unk w="terms"/> both now and in the future .

The food industry has a <unk w="direct"/> impact on employment , as it provides work for more than four million people in Europe .

The <unk w="food"/> food chain in Finland is estimated to employ approximately 300 000 people , which is <unk w="only"/> 13 % of <unk w="the"/> employed workforce .

<unk w="there"/> is an unquestionable need to <unk w="protect"/> these people 's jobs during these times of food and <unk w="in"/> crisis .

in writing . - ( <unk w="sv"/> ) It is interesting to note that the Committee on <unk w="agriculture"/> and Rural Development has not chosen to include <unk w="in"/> its report a key issue proposed by the <unk w="committee"/> <unk w="on"/> Development , which reads : ' the European Parliament calls <unk w="upon"/> <unk w="the"/> Council and the Commission , in close consultation with the ACP countries , to give priority to <unk w="the"/> question of <unk w="the"/> impact <unk w="of"/> the ACP countries of EU subsidies on the <unk w="part"/> of EU agricultural <unk w="produce"/> and to <unk w="contribute"/> to providing specific , sustainable responses aimed at avoiding dumping , in compliance with the commitments made in this area . '

However , in the report it is claimed that the <unk w="commission"/> has addressed the potentially trade-distorting <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> EU agricultural policy that can negatively impact on farmers in the developing world .

These two claims in the report <unk w="are"/> controversial , to say the <unk w="least"/> , and not something that all <unk w="the"/> <unk w="political"/> forces within the EU would agree with .

If this were the case , could the <unk w="commission"/> on <unk w="today"/> 's proposal not also be included in the <unk w="conclusions"/> of the report ?

The report is also against reductions in aid payments within agriculture and is <unk w="applicable"/> to any reform of <unk w="the"/> common agricultural policy .

Moreover , it proposes a citizen information policy regarding the common agricultural <unk w="policy"/> , which I view as political propaganda for a system that is very <unk w="important"/> , particularly in my country .

The recent extraordinary surge in food prices rightly prompted a discussion on <unk w="the"/> <unk w="safety"/> , <unk w="social"/> security and development .

Regrettably , the issue of international trade is often missing <unk w="in"/> such debates , thus leading to the search for solutions which ignore the positive potential that <unk w="the"/> world consumption can have .

Although initially this <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> price inflation poses a threat of famine for countries <unk w="and"/> populations without resources , and demands increased humanitarian aid , it <unk w="is"/> stimulates a global increase in food production capacity and a rise in global <unk w="prices"/> .

This is an opportunity for <unk w="the"/> agricultural populations of <unk w="the"/> world , of which full advantage must be taken .

As for Europe and <unk w="the"/> common agricultural policy , our adaptation to this new world context - with a potential for slower growth than expected - <unk w="does"/> not occur at the cost of <unk w="the"/> protectionism and new barriers to trade or market distortion .

The medium- and long-term profitability <unk w="of"/> European agriculture and rural development <unk w="to"/> be the criteria used in the common agricultural policy and its reform .

<unk w="this"/> report looks <unk w="ahead"/> like a defence of the current common agricultural policy than a comprehensive overview of food security in a starving world .

Despite this I have supported it , because it <unk w="draws"/> attention to the importance of securing access to <unk w="our"/> <unk w="young"/> farmers in developing countries so that they can modernise agricultural production and increase the output and quality <unk w="of"/> their food .

I regret that <unk w="the"/> report paid little attention to the risks of land being bought up in the world 's poorest countries for growing and exporting the cheapest possible food to the <unk w="end"/> of the <unk w="market"/> , at the expense of the economic development and needs of local populations in countries suffering from <unk w="processed"/> food shortages .

Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="report"/> by Mrs McGuinness on the common agricultural policy and global food security .

I share the concerns expressed by my fellow Member and draw attention to the need , which is more pressing than ever , for appropriate measures <unk w="to"/> be taken to guarantee all citizens access to healthy , nutritious food , whether they are resident <unk w="in"/> the European <unk w="union"/> or elsewhere in the <unk w="union"/> .

I wish to <unk w="say"/> that our efforts must be viewed from a medium- to <unk w="the"/> perspective and not focused merely on the short term .

It <unk w="would"/> not be enough to earmark substantial funding for poor and developing countries unless this is backed by a <unk w="strong"/> commitment by industrialised countries to <unk w="invest"/> off the speculation on the prices <unk w="of"/> staple foods that we have seen recently <unk w="to"/> introduce international <unk w="regulations"/> that take into account the very varied <unk w="of"/> <unk w="developing"/> countries <unk w="which"/> belong to the World Trade <unk w="organisation"/> .

We must make sure that we <unk w="play"/> our part in the EU ensuring that the hungry across the world are fed .

It is a <unk w="fact"/> that there are people in this world starving <unk w="to"/> death due to our lack of political coordination .

The purpose of the <unk w="common"/> agricultural policy <unk w="is"/> not only to increase agricultural <unk w="expenditure"/> and ensure rational development of farming production through optimal use of production factors , especially the workforce , but <unk w="also"/> to <unk w="the"/> rural populations <unk w="and"/> a <unk w="high"/> standard of <unk w="living"/> , guarantee security of supplies and ensure reasonable prices for supplies to consumers .

<unk w="according"/> to sufficient <unk w="account"/> of <unk w="training"/> and nutritious food is currently a key political <unk w="to"/> <unk w="at"/> EU and world level .

It is disturbing <unk w="that"/> food prices are higher than in previous <unk w="years"/> , and world food stocks <unk w="have"/> fallen <unk w="at"/> a critically low level .

There is a danger that <unk w="the"/> world financial crisis may induce developed countries not to honour their <unk w="obligations"/> <unk w="in"/> the area of aid to <unk w="third"/> countries .

Medium- and long-term action is needed to <unk w="harmonise"/> world food production and to support those people who <unk w="are"/> most seriously affected in terms of basic nutritional needs .

The greatest challenge <unk w="it"/> is to develop a policy for agriculture and food which will meet the needs of the increasingly numerous world population , which , according <unk w="to"/> estimates , by the year 2050 will have grown by 40 % , while world food demand is expected to double in the same period .

Development of a policy which <unk w="will"/> ensure farmers a decent income <unk w="from"/> the food they produce is a key <unk w="to"/> issue .

This <unk w="is"/> of fundamental importance in <unk w="terms"/> of safeguarding food production .

<unk w="but"/> the market is not able <unk w="to"/> ensure this , it should be done through appropriate policy .

in writing . - The Labour delegation will be voting in <unk w="favour"/> of the CAP and Global Food Security report , despite the strong reservations we <unk w="have"/> on <unk w="the"/> stance taken on the CAP .

We do not agree with the prominent role attributed to the <unk w="public"/> in ensuring food security nor with the <unk w="success"/> of <unk w="the"/> CAP reform , which <unk w="have"/> seen a shift away from quantity to quality production , the implication being that this has undermined our food security .

<unk w="the"/> position is that we need to modernise our agricultural policy , and not return to a production-based policy that encouraged <unk w="the"/> over-production and a distortion of markets , undermining the ability of other <unk w="countries"/> to produce and trade agricultural goods .

We do , <unk w="however"/> , feel that <unk w="this"/> report raises many very important points on the issue of global food <unk w="aid"/> , such as recognising the importance of food <unk w="production"/> as a key political <unk w="partner"/> <unk w="within"/> the EU , <unk w="and"/> for greater cooperation on a global level , <unk w="especially"/> for more investment in developing countries to build up their <unk w="production"/> capacities , and <unk w="not"/> for agriculture to be <unk w="defined"/> at the heart of the EU 's development agenda .

All of these points are equally important <unk w="to"/> demand that we look <unk w="at"/> the narrow focus of those using this issue as justification for a <unk w="new"/> interventionist and protectionist CAP <unk w="so"/> that we support the report .

in writing . - ( SV ) We <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> Social Democrats voted in favour of the report by Mrs Grabowska on <unk w="financial"/> perspectives for developing civil dialogue under the Treaty of Lisbon .

Strengthening the dialogue with civil <unk w="society"/> is important for <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> EU that listens to <unk w="progress"/> represents the views <unk w="of"/> its citizens .

We also agree with the demands in the report for work in <unk w="the"/> Council to be more open <unk w="in"/> order to <unk w="encourage"/> civil society to participate in the dialogue in a meaningful way .

However , we would like to make it clear that we believe it to be wrong for churches and religious <unk w="freedom"/> to <unk w="be"/> given a special status among civil <unk w="rights"/> organisations .

Churches and religious communities <unk w="should"/> take part in the dialogue with the Union 's institutions in the same way as all other organisations .

Madam President , every initiative which aims <unk w="to"/> bring citizens closer to the institutions which act on their behalf should be supported .

However , care should be taken to ensure that the proposed <unk w="directive"/> is not by its own momentum transformed into another institution .

I <unk w="support"/> the report because every step taken to bring citizens closer to <unk w="the"/> authorities which make decisions for them is a step towards a better and more transparent democracy .

However , I want to <unk w="say"/> that , <unk w="as"/> is the case in every dialogue , so also in the one concerning the Lisbon Treaty the opinion of every party should be <unk w="taken"/> into account .

in writing . - This report <unk w="relates"/> to <unk w="the"/> Lisbon treaty , which , let me <unk w="remind"/> you , is not in force .

It is therefore highly presumptuous , <unk w="not"/> to say arrogant , to be invoking the name of the Lisbon treaty as if it was already a fact of life .

In case you had forgotten : the <unk w="rome"/> treaty was <unk w="rejected"/> by the democratic will of the <unk w="republic"/> of Ireland .

In voting the way they did , <unk w="the"/> people of Ireland also spoke for the citizens of every <unk w="individual"/> Member State , including <unk w="my"/> own , <unk w="who"/> were denied a referendum by their governments .

Ireland has been <unk w="translated"/> into holding a second vote , but the Irish people are unlikely to take kindly to being treated <unk w="any"/> such contempt .

It merely serves to expose the EU 's arrogant <unk w="congratulations"/> for democratic opinion .

in writing . - ( NL ) I may be living <unk w="in"/> a different <unk w="issue"/> , but I seem to remember that the Dutch and French people rejected the European Constitution <unk w="in"/> a democratic referendum in 2005 .

That Constitution is dead and buried , at least if <unk w="we"/> call ourselves democrats .

The cursed Treaty of <unk w="amsterdam"/> , which is simply an airbrushed version of the Constitution , suffered exactly the same fate , rejected , as it was , in a democratic referendum by the Irish people .

Europe , however , refuses to accept the opinion of the people and wants <unk w="to"/> ram the Constitution down the throats of Europeans through the backdoor , pretending that everything in the garden is <unk w="right"/> and talking of a so-called ' <unk w="contract"/> with the citizen in the <unk w="light"/> of the Treaty <unk w="of"/> Lisbon ' with the greatest <unk w="importance"/> .

<unk w="what"/> is supposed <unk w="to"/> be a ' dialogue with the citizen ' , ' a strong culture of consultation and dialogue ' , whereby the rapporteur , in her cynicism , <unk w="will"/> <unk w="the"/> more Article 10 of the Treaty on European Union : ' Every citizen shall have the right to participate in the democratic life of the <unk w="country"/> ' .

This may be true , but Europe does not <unk w="accept"/> any notice of the democratic voice <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="eu"/> .

<unk w="in"/> writing . - This report by Genowefa Grabowska provides for increased mechanisms of participation and for vehicles for civil dialogue within the European Union .

It recognises the need to increase civil dialogue to <unk w="the"/> true engagement <unk w="and"/> the aims of the European project .

Addressing the generalised lack of information is key to achieving a genuine <unk w="european"/> partnership .

<unk w="according"/> to this proposal is <unk w="the"/> insistence that <unk w="there"/> is reciprocal , that the opinions expressed need to be <unk w="made"/> and respected .

For <unk w="this"/> report , Ms Grabowska highlights both transparency and <unk w="clarity"/> as essential components of active civil <unk w="society"/> and a genuine participatory democracy .

A more <unk w="efficient"/> and accessible Council , increased <unk w="and"/> more integrated inter-institutional cooperation , better use of new media as a means to connect with <unk w="us"/> and providing assistance to civil society institutions will help bring Europe <unk w="more"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .

<unk w="this"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> . - We support any and all efforts to empower citizens , communities and civil society <unk w=","/> with regard to <unk w="the"/> decision-making processes , including the EU .

However , we do not believe that the <unk w="maastricht"/> Treaty provides any real advance in this field .

<unk w="but"/> we believe that for the <unk w="european"/> Citizens Initiative to be meaningful , the Commission should be under a legally binding <unk w="procedure"/> to produce a White Paper outlining a response to the proposal , or the Treaty basis for not taking action .

<unk w="this"/> report is yet another one which goes against the majority of the European Parliament in its efforts to try <unk w="the"/> ' sell ' the Treaty of Lisbon <unk w=","/> at <unk w="the"/> cost , a task which has not proved easy , judging <unk w="from"/> the results <unk w="of"/> previous referendums .

These repeated efforts have at least one merit : they clearly show how difficult and even painful it is for the Treaty <unk w="which"/> advocates to find arguments to promote it .

No propaganda exists - and this is <unk w="the"/> subject of the report - which <unk w="will"/> disguise <unk w="the"/> anti-democratic nature of the insistence <unk w="on"/> the EU 's leaders on forcing another referendum <unk w="on"/> Ireland in order <unk w="to"/> impose this proposed Treaty .

We do not share the narrow view of those who consider that <unk w="of"/> a ' civil dialogue ' or a ' citizens ' initiative ' is sufficient to counteract the <unk w="content"/> of a proposal which , <unk w="as"/> a whole , prevents the citizens of each Member State from defining <unk w="a"/> collective future , and which insists on measures resulting <unk w="from"/> precarious jobs , increased <unk w="working"/> hours , easier redundancies and the privatisation of public services .

No propaganda exists which can conceal the neoliberal , <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and militarist content of this Treaty project .

Mrs Grabrowska 's report recommends permanent dialogue between all the European institutions and the ' representatives ' from civil <unk w="society"/> to define <unk w="them"/> <unk w="and"/> draw up legislation at EU level , in other words a formal , compulsory organisation of participatory ' democracy ' at <unk w="european"/> level .

The <unk w="commission"/> is , participatory ' democracy ' is <unk w="not"/> a front for those who reject true democracy : it allows dialogue to be <unk w="able"/> to <unk w="the"/> most active organisations , <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> rarely the most representative , <unk w="and"/> it appears <unk w="to"/> test citizens ' views in advance , the better to be able <unk w="to"/> refuse to consult them <unk w="speak"/> later on .

If the Europe of <unk w="turkey"/> wishes to hear the citizens , let it take note of the French and Dutch ' no ' to the European Constitution and abandon the Treaty of Lisbon , which is a mere copy of the Constitution .

If <unk w="the"/> polls ought <unk w="to"/> be <unk w="put"/> into <unk w="account"/> , as the rapporteur would like , put a <unk w="result"/> <unk w="on"/> the negotiations <unk w="on"/> <unk w="turkey"/> 's membership , because the majority of Europe 's citizens oppose it .

If it is right to respect the principle that decisions should be taken <unk w="as"/> close as <unk w="possible"/> to the citizens , let Europe cease <unk w="to"/> rule over our daily <unk w="lives"/> .

Then it <unk w="will"/> have some credibility when it <unk w="is"/> of <unk w="it"/> .

in writing . - ( SV ) I voted in <unk w="favour"/> of the report <unk w="and"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="report"/> on the perspectives for developing <unk w="the"/> dialogue under the Treaty of <unk w="nice"/> .

I <unk w="think"/> that it <unk w="is"/> important to strengthen the dialogue with civil society in order to create an EU that listens to and represents the views of its citizens .

I also agree with <unk w="the"/> demands in the report for work in the Council to be more open in order to enable civil society to participate in the dialogue <unk w="in"/> a meaningful way .

However , I believe <unk w="that"/> the <unk w="provisions"/> of the Treaty of Lisbon was unnecessary , as it is no longer relevant after the Irish ' no ' vote in the referendum .

It is also wrong for churches and religious communities to be <unk w="given"/> a special status among civil society organisations .

Churches and religious communities <unk w="should"/> take part in the dialogue with the Union <unk w="'s"/> institutions in <unk w="the"/> same way as all the other organisations .

I agree with the report on the perspectives for <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> dialogue under the Treaty of Lisbon .

I consider civil dialogue to be very important , so that the citizens of the EU can gain <unk w="some"/> insight into the areas of <unk w="one"/> of their elected representatives .

I should like to highlight <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="cooperation"/> between the EU and the Union citizens should be a two-way dialogue , because it is not enough to inform our <unk w="candidate"/> countries about the implementation <unk w="of"/> projects ; we also have to listen to individual people <unk w="to"/> take their opinion seriously .

in writing . - ( SV ) The Treaty of Lisbon <unk w="has"/> <unk w="has"/> been adopted .

It was <unk w="rejected"/> by the voters of Ireland in a referendum and <unk w="it"/> must be considered dead .

What <unk w="is"/> , essentially , the same draft treaty had already been <unk w="passed"/> in referendums in France and <unk w="the"/> Netherlands .

However , the <unk w="european"/> Parliament 's federalist majority is unwilling to listen , insisting , instead , on a <unk w="matter"/> that is governed to an even greater extent at the supranational level , despite the fact that its citizens have <unk w="expressed"/> their scepticism in multiple referendums and that , given <unk w="the"/> chance , they would show this <unk w=","/> in even more countries , too .

The way of working demonstrated by the European Parliament 's federalist majority shows what <unk w="is"/> of a civil dialogue it is that <unk w="we"/> want .

They <unk w="also"/> want to listen to those parts of civil society that fit into the federalist mould .

Outside the <unk w="conciliation"/> procedure , the report <unk w="we"/> have before us is not particularly impressive .

Paragraph 9 of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="resolution"/> states that all EU <unk w="citizens"/> should maintain up-to-date registers of all relevant non-governmental organisations .

This <unk w="is"/> an unnecessary increase in bureaucracy that leads nowhere .

<unk w="finally"/> , paragraph 11 of the report talks about promoting an ' <unk w="large"/> European mindset ' among EU citizens .

However , the worst aspect <unk w="of"/> the report is the call , in paragraph 22 , to give European associations and European civil <unk w="service"/> organisations a <unk w="new"/> legal basis at EU level .

This proposal <unk w="is"/> yet another step towards constructing an EU state .

It may sound really nice <unk w="to"/> talk of a public debate on the <unk w="outcome"/> <unk w="of"/> Lisbon in all the languages .

Despite all the camouflage manoeuvres , the <unk w="latter"/> have understood full well that a treaty <unk w="that"/> is 95 % in keeping with the rejected EU Constitution is no Columbus 's <unk w="approach"/> , even if the EU establishment <unk w="is"/> trying to <unk w="prevent"/> it as <unk w="well"/> .

It is <unk w="also"/> interesting , given that we want to conduct this dialogue <unk w="in"/> all the languages , that <unk w="they"/> are not even in a position to ensure that the President-in-Office of the Council has an integrated <unk w="approach"/> in the most widely spoken languages in the Union , namely English , French and <unk w="french"/> .

We must <unk w="therefore"/> <unk w="be"/> particularly ridiculous to our citizens <unk w=","/> praising <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> civil initiatives provided for in the Constitution as a step towards more democracy , given that referendums are being repeated until the result wanted by <unk w="the"/> EU is obtained .

<unk w="but"/> this initiative can only be yet another pure pro-EU-Constitution <unk w="report"/> , on which enough money has already been spent , I <unk w="voted"/> against the Grabowska report .

<unk w="we"/> <unk w="the"/> European Union to be able to achieve its aims and objectives , it needs a broader public <unk w="debate"/> , a more effective civil dialogue and development <unk w="and"/> political awareness , all aspects recognised in <unk w="the"/> report .

The report also highlights the importance of the expertise which civil society makes available to institutions and emphasises the role and significance <unk w="and"/> functions for <unk w="consumers"/> and raising awareness involved in civil dialogue .

I hope that the EU 's current initiatives , which promote greater involvement by civil society in the <unk w="european"/> integration process , will continue in the future as well .

I am referring <unk w="in"/> <unk w="for"/> instance to initiatives such as Europe by Satellite , Citizens ' Agora and other citizen forums on various topics .

I hope that this report will encourage the European Union 's <unk w="action"/> to facilitate and <unk w="improve"/> access to its proceedings , as <unk w="it"/> is a basic condition for initiating a proper dialogue with civil society .

Ladies and gentlemen , I welcome <unk w="the"/> fact that the report draws attention to <unk w="the"/> need for social dialogue at a <unk w="time"/> when <unk w="third"/> countries are experiencing a democratic crisis .

People either do not understand or are not interested in topics unrelated to their everyday <unk w="lives"/> .

The <unk w="low"/> turnout in European elections is a logical <unk w="view"/> of the fact that European citizens do not know what positive contribution European legislation <unk w="can"/> make to them and <unk w="i"/> do not believe their vote can <unk w="have"/> any influence .

It is little known that the Lisbon <unk w="summit"/> <unk w="will"/> <unk w="a"/> democracy .

I agree with <unk w="the"/> Grabowska <unk w="that"/> the Member States should provide more fundamental support to <unk w="this"/> <unk w="them"/> .

I have backed the <unk w="floor"/> also <unk w="because"/> it includes a request <unk w="by"/> the Commission to publish <unk w="some"/> of the non-governmental organisations <unk w="which"/> have applied its proposals during the legislative preparations .

This will certainly <unk w="be"/> the anonymity of the whole process and contribute <unk w="to"/> the non-governmental organisations being more representative .

I also take the view that the election <unk w="planned"/> for the European Parliament provides a <unk w="new"/> opportunity for responsible MEPs to explain what decisions <unk w="we"/> make in Strasbourg , how civil society participates in our work <unk w="and"/> how it will <unk w="be"/> able <unk w="to"/> participate following adoption of the <unk w="new"/> <unk w="process"/> .

The Lisbon Treaty accords dialogue with citizens the status of an <unk w="individual"/> .

This is binding on all EU policies <unk w="in"/> spheres of activity .

The success of dialogue depends on representativeness , and <unk w="also"/> on the strong commitment of key entities .

National , <unk w="regional"/> and local authorities should use the method of dialogue , so that citizens <unk w="have"/> experience participatory democracy working in practice .

It should be admitted that the <unk w="european"/> Union has a lot of <unk w="time"/> to make up in the area of communication , and indeed especially in the area of dialogue with citizens .

The citizens of the EU must be sure <unk w="that"/> <unk w="make"/> decisions at European level will be made without their involvement , and that by voting in elections they will <unk w="have"/> a real influence on the form of those decisions .

I fully support the call by the <unk w="commission"/> to encourage the promotion of initiatives <unk w="in"/> the area of dialogue with citizens .

in <unk w="fact"/> . - It is premature to be talking about what will happen once the Lisbon treaty comes into effect .

The <unk w="situation"/> remains in limbo and is still subject to a possible second ' no ' vote <unk w="to"/> Irish citizens in another referendum later this year .

Doing so <unk w="gives"/> us <unk w="is"/> open to <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> arrogance and contempt for the democratic process , which must still be concluded one way or another .

We have free media and vigorous democracies in the Member <unk w="states"/> and are quite capable of conducting this debate on our own terms without the Commission trying to influence matters .

In fact , in <unk w="that"/> country , the UK , the Commission 's attempts to promote further EU integration tends to be <unk w="defined"/> .

<unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="this"/> is yet another example of the scandalous way in which this Parliament handles the principles it <unk w="considers"/> to serve .

' Dialogue with the citizen in the framework of the Treaty <unk w="of"/> Lisbon ' : what a joke !

The Treaty of Lisbon , which is the ex-European Constitution in disguise , was consigned to the waste paper bin in referendums <unk w="in"/> the Netherlands and in France , and subsequently also in <unk w="writing"/> .

If it is dialogue with <unk w="the"/> citizen that Europe is after , then it should <unk w="be"/> respecting democracy .

If the outcome of a referendum is not <unk w="on"/> the liking of the Eurocratic <unk w="union"/> , this does not necessarily mean that the voting public is lacking in brain cells .

At <unk w="any"/> rate , I emphatically voted against this report again .

However , particular interest groups , lobbies that do not represent the common good , should not be allowed to infiltrate the legislative process <unk w="in"/> the guise of a dialogue with civil society .

I insist that dialogue should <unk w="deal"/> especially with associations that give a voice to the poorest individuals and families .

The fight against extreme poverty and social inequalities <unk w="will"/> have <unk w="a"/> lasting success without a permanent dialogue with <unk w="the"/> families and individuals who experience extreme poverty in their daily lives .

The European , national , regional and local <unk w="authorities"/> cannot take the <unk w="same"/> route when we are building an inclusive society and a Europe <unk w="above"/> all .

In terms of best practice , we should recognise the work of the European Economic and Social Committee and the International <unk w="federation"/> ATD Fourth World which , since <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> , have been organising European sessions of Fourth World People 's Universities , which allow <unk w="the"/> dialogue between representatives of the authorities and people with direct <unk w="respect"/> of extreme poverty .

in writing . - I abstained on this vote because , although I and <unk w="the"/> UK Independence Party fully support equality between men and women , the UK already has equality legislation which can be <unk w="effective"/> or <unk w="controlled"/> when required by our own democratically elected and accountable Parliament .

The EU is anti-democratic and undemocratic <unk w="terrorism"/> is not a legitimate guardian of anyone 's rights .

I endorse the Weiler report and express support for measures aimed at <unk w="improving"/> the directive concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market .

The idea of creating a blacklist of unfair commercial practices , not only for business-to-consumer <unk w=","/> but also for business-to-business relations , is laudable .

I also <unk w="support"/> the mechanisms for monitoring and enforcement of the implementation of legal regulations in the area of consumer protection <unk w="is"/> unfair <unk w="competition"/> , and I support the initiative to open a publicly accessible database of national measures adopted in transposition of the Directive concerning unfair commercial practices .

<unk w="from"/> the point of view of the Polish <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="european"/> consumer , the initiative is valuable .

We abstained on the <unk w="annual"/> report on protecting <unk w="consumers"/> and companies against unfair practices and misleading advertising as we have <unk w="had"/> criticisms of it .

The first is that the European legislation <unk w="on"/> these issues is presented as a directive , in other words <unk w=","/> <unk w="member"/> States are relatively free in the resources <unk w="we"/> implement to achieve the objectives assigned to them .

The rapporteur <unk w="would"/> wish for <unk w="this"/> , <unk w="both"/> in the substance and <unk w="in"/> the form of national legislation , will remain a wish unless there is unacceptable <unk w="either"/> by the European Union in the <unk w="legal"/> and administrative systems <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="member"/> States , <unk w="will"/> no real benefit to consumers .

<unk w="the"/> second is that the main added value that the European Union brings to these areas is the help in resolving cross-border disputes .

This issue has not been properly resolved <unk w=","/> in <unk w="the"/> current applicable texts or in those called for .

The main objective of <unk w="this"/> legislation should not be to exist per se but to protect consumers and companies .

<unk w="the"/> Directive concerning unfair commercial <unk w="protection"/> and the Directive concerning misleading and comparative advertising have immense <unk w="effects"/> in <unk w="terms"/> of <unk w="european"/> consumers more confidence and ensuring legal certainty for businesses in the internal market .

Unfortunately , a number of Member States have not yet fulfilled this obligation , <unk w="which"/> does not contribute to the building of appropriate relationships between businesses and consumers .

In 2007 the <unk w="european"/> Commission used for <unk w="the"/> first <unk w="of"/> the ' EU Sweep ' as a tool to check and <unk w="for"/> the implementation of consumer protection legislation as regards airline websites .

Irregularities <unk w="have"/> confirmed on as many as 43.6 % of the <unk w="availability"/> reviewed , which only confirms the necessity of greater monitoring in relation to the enforcement of existing provisions .

I <unk w="welcome"/> the Commission <unk w="'s"/> initiative concerning the creation of a publicly accessible database of national <unk w="measures"/> adopted in transposition <unk w="of"/> these directives .

<unk w="in"/> writing . - The EU has made significant progress in improving consumers ' rights .

It is disappointing that some Member States have <unk w="failed"/> to transpose the <unk w="new"/> Commercial <unk w="insurance"/> Directive ; and this House <unk w="has"/> today sent a clear message <unk w="to"/> those Member States should address this shortcoming .

We adopted <unk w="an"/> EU directive protecting consumers from unfair <unk w="competition"/> practices and misleading advertising back in 2005 .

However , we still refuse <unk w="to"/> protect citizens <unk w=","/> Internet callers , unwanted advertising calls and Scammer & Co .

Rip-off companies hide behind post office boxes , <unk w="and"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="""/> .

It is important for customers who have <unk w="been"/> ripped off to be able to file a compensation claim , otherwise we <unk w="have"/> just hanging them out to dry .

The planned changes will <unk w="improve"/> the situation for consumers , which is why I <unk w="voted"/> in favour .

While these directives form the backbone <unk w="of"/> consumer protection in the EU , they must be consistently applied in the Member States , especially for Internet purchases .

The internal market must not be fragmented and businesses and consumers must <unk w="work"/> under the same rules <unk w="for"/> protection regardless of which <unk w="they"/> <unk w="whether"/> they are buying or selling in .

I must <unk w="draw"/> your attention to the fact that some Member States , including the Czech Republic , have been late in transposing the directives into <unk w="their"/> national legislation .

The most important thing now <unk w="is"/> whether the national supervisory authorities will <unk w="soon"/> force unfair businesses to put these rules into practice .

It is also <unk w="important"/> for <unk w="the"/> institutions to support greater cooperation between the national councils for radio and <unk w="public"/> broadcasting which have to monitor <unk w="compliance"/> with <unk w="the"/> directives in the mass media and it is in our <unk w="eyes"/> <unk w="for"/> the supervision to be applied consistently across the entire EU .

Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I am <unk w="not"/> in favour of Mrs Weiler 's report on <unk w="the"/> transposition , implementation and <unk w="implementation"/> of Directive 2005 / 29 / EC concerning unfair <unk w="any"/> commercial practices <unk w="in"/> the internal market and Directive 2006 / <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> / EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising .

I am firmly <unk w="convinced"/> that the proper <unk w="application"/> of the directive will <unk w="make"/> it possible for the public to be fully aware of their rights .

The extension of consumer rights through the <unk w="establishment"/> <unk w="of"/> unfair commercial practices must be backed by the measures <unk w="which"/> <unk w="to"/> facilitate the exercise <unk w="of"/> those rights .

I agree with the rapporteur when she states that appropriate transposition , implementation and enforcement of the <unk w="directive"/> on unfair <unk w="competition"/> <unk w="market"/> practices and on misleading and comparative advertising are of fundamental importance to the achievement of the aims <unk w="laid"/> down <unk w="by"/> the Directives , particularly in the light of the different application and implementation methods and systems used in the Member States , the complexity of some of <unk w="the"/> legal concepts contained in the Directives , <unk w="the"/> quantity and exhaustive nature of <unk w="the"/> standards governing unfair commercial practices and misleading advertising and also the extensive range of application of the Directive .

Lastly , I am delighted by <unk w="my"/> fellow Member 's initiative , the aim of which is the legal <unk w="basis"/> of a topic that is of paramount importance to <unk w="the"/> Community .

I definitely endorse Barbara <unk w="swoboda"/> 's report <unk w="on"/> the transposition , implementation and enforcement of the Directive concerning unfair <unk w="trade"/> practices in the internal market and the Directive <unk w="on"/> misleading and comparative advertising .

The issue of misleading and comparative <unk w="information"/> in business-to-business transactions has been regulated by the introduction of a single , <unk w="centralised"/> directive .

The issue of unfair commercial <unk w="safety"/> <unk w="of"/> business-to-consumer <unk w=","/> has been regulated by Directive 2005 / 29 / EC .

The Directives were prepared to <unk w="give"/> consumers more confidence ( their protection has increased due to the drawing <unk w="up"/> of a ' <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> ' of commercial practices which should be <unk w="used"/> , and thanks to <unk w="the"/> harmonisation of the <unk w="protection"/> of consumers against unfair practices ) and also to provide businesses with greater legal certainty .

A greater degree of protection could have been achieved if the provisions of the Directive were accompanied <unk w="by"/> legal measures allowing effective enforcement .

<unk w="member"/> States must therefore screen their legal systems and increase the clarity of the <unk w="peace"/> process .

The changes introduced must be supported by clear procedures for implementation <unk w="and"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="measures"/> for redress , which will give consumers <unk w="the"/> right to bring claims for damages for losses incurred in connection with unfair commercial practices , like the mechanisms <unk w="for"/> monitoring consumer protection <unk w="in"/> relation to airline websites first used in 2007 .

At the Member State level awareness campaigns and <unk w="programmes"/> which improve levels of consumer education on the subject of consumer rights and their use should be considered .

in writing . - ( SV ) We <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> Social Democrats voted against the report <unk w="on"/> the ecosystem approach to fisheries management .

We believe that the report does not make it clear that the fisheries policy must be devised with environmental and sustainability criteria <unk w="from"/> the <unk w="third"/> point .

In addition , <unk w="the"/> report focuses <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> too much on holding <unk w="it"/> <unk w="with"/> the necessary reforms of the fisheries policy and protects the interests of the <unk w="local"/> fishing industry .

Summarised very briefly , <unk w="an"/> own-initiative report of the European Parliament <unk w=","/> to integrate the Community <unk w="measures"/> for the conservation of the marine environment <unk w="in"/> the common <unk w="fisheries"/> policy ( CFP ) , which has , as <unk w="part"/> of its operational objectives , the gradual application of an ecosystem approach <unk w="to"/> fisheries <unk w="policy"/> .

The fundamental points of this report that I should like to highlight are the <unk w="fact"/> that <unk w="it"/> considers that the present system of total allowable catches and quotas does not serve the aims of the reformed CFP , having proven inadequate for both the Community fisheries sector and the conservation of stocks .

Alternative management systems should be quickly established and , against this backdrop , I consider that the EU should be swifter in discussing alternative approaches , given that some , such as management based on fishing rights ( for example ) , form the cornerstone in countries such as the United States , New Zealand , Norway <unk w="and"/> Iceland , all with a strong <unk w="desire"/> and great potential in the fisheries sector .

Reformulating the <unk w="action"/> plan for hake and lobster is another fundamental point which should be considered .

Although I do not agree <unk w="with"/> the whole content of the adopted resolution , <unk w="which"/> does contain a series of important <unk w="principles"/> and principles that should prevail in a fisheries policy .

It will be particularly important to reaffirm and defend these objectives and principles ( as <unk w="the"/> Portuguese Communist Party ( PCP ) has consistently done ) , many of which are not <unk w="accompanied"/> by the common fisheries policy ( CFP ) ( even though <unk w="the"/> <unk w="is"/> included in it ) , when the <unk w="european"/> Commission announces the presentation , next April , of a green <unk w="paper"/> on <unk w="the"/> future of the common fisheries policy , indicating a possible reform of this policy by 2012 .

Given the objectives and intentions <unk w="which"/> have <unk w="been"/> set out by the European Commission and other EU institutions on the future of the fishing industry , this <unk w="is"/> in Portugal - which is in deep crisis , the causes of which <unk w="exist"/> in the onerous policies followed for decades at national and Community level - should <unk w="be"/> alert to and should mobilise against new <unk w="companies"/> even more onerous measures .

If adopted and <unk w="effective"/> , these would bring about the destruction of a large part of <unk w="the"/> strategic sector , <unk w="the"/> negative consequences for Portugal .

There are alternative policies for the fishing industry in <unk w="europe"/> .

These are policies which the PCP has been proposing and defending <unk w="at"/> both national level and in the European Parliament .

in writing . - I voted in favour of Mr Guerreiro 's <unk w="report"/> .

The report correctly notes that EU fisheries policy should promote the modernisation and sustainable development of the fishing <unk w="industry"/> , safeguarding its socio-economic viability <unk w=","/> the sustainability of fisheries resources , and guaranteeing the supply of fish to the <unk w="area"/> <unk w="of"/> food sovereignty and security , the preservation of jobs and improved living conditions <unk w="for"/> fishermen .

This <unk w="is"/> the opposite of what the CFP has achieved over the last three decades , and accordingly I <unk w="support"/> the repatriation of fisheries management .

Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour <unk w="of"/> Mr Guerreiro 's report on the CFP ( common fisheries policy ) and the ecosystem approach to fisheries management .

It <unk w="is"/> of fundamental importance not to confuse sea or ocean policy with fishing policy : I totally agree with the rapporteur on this score .

A fishing policy must be based on the principle that <unk w="an"/> interdependence exists <unk w="between"/> the wellbeing of the fishing community and the sustainability of the ecosystems of which they form an integral part , <unk w="particularly"/> by acknowledging the specific nature and importance of small-scale coastal fishing and artisanal fishing .
