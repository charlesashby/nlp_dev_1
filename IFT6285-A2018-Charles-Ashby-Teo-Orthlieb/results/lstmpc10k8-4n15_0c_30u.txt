It is important for me to <unk w="take"/> advantage of the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> anniversary of this <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> event <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> to pay <unk w="tribute"/> , in <unk w="my"/> turn , to those <unk w="people"/> who created <unk w="the"/> euro , such <unk w="as"/> Pierre Werner , <unk w="the"/> Kohl , François Mitterrand , Jacques Delors , Valéry <unk w="giscard"/> d 'Estaing <unk w="and"/> others .

I would <unk w="like"/> , <unk w="once"/> again , to <unk w="congratulate"/> their <unk w="courage"/> , their determination and their unfailing commitment to Europe .

<unk w="as"/> I <unk w="have"/> mentioned , and <unk w="the"/> others who accompanied <unk w="them"/> , <unk w="does"/> not have imagined the rapid success <unk w="of"/> their political project .

Since 1 <unk w="february"/> of this year , <unk w="the"/> Member States <unk w="have"/> been participating in the Economic <unk w="and"/> Monetary <unk w="union"/> and the <unk w="euro"/> is the currency of almost 330 <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> European citizens .

The euro , then , <unk w="has"/> become the most tangible sign of European integration .

As a <unk w="good"/> sign recognised around the world , the euro is a measure of <unk w="war"/> .

It is protecting <unk w="the"/> citizens from the <unk w="very"/> serious consequences <unk w="of"/> the economic crisis .

After 10 years , it has to be <unk w="said"/> that <unk w="the"/> euro is an unquestionable success .

Now , anniversaries <unk w="would"/> have value if <unk w="we"/> are <unk w="given"/> to the future , as <unk w="we"/> have to recognise that , despite <unk w="the"/> collective indulgence as <unk w="we"/> congratulate ourselves , the true <unk w="respect"/> for <unk w="the"/> cohesiveness and coherence of the <unk w="free-trade"/> area await <unk w="them"/> .

<unk w="last"/> year , 2009 , will be <unk w="an"/> extremely difficult year <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="free-trade"/> area <unk w=","/> and for European citizens and <unk w="there"/> will be many <unk w="challenges"/> facing us , <unk w="both"/> internally and <unk w="women"/> .

Internally , euro area governments will have <unk w="to"/> act <unk w="or"/> to contain the effects of the <unk w="bse"/> crisis and <unk w=","/> in the structural bases of the <unk w="union"/> to build a bridge to <unk w="the"/> post-crisis <unk w="future"/> .

<unk w="we"/> must not <unk w="lose"/> sight of the <unk w="fact"/> that <unk w="the"/> euro , this protective <unk w="delivery"/> we have built <unk w="on"/> our economies , <unk w="and"/> not just fall into our laps .

<unk w="the"/> euro <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> economies are better <unk w="directed"/> against <unk w="the"/> economic <unk w="situation"/> because being <unk w="part"/> of the euro <unk w=","/> is a mark of quality certifying that its members <unk w="have"/> a <unk w="personal"/> capacity for <unk w="the"/> prudent macroeconomic policies <unk w="and"/> policies based on sustained growth and prosperity <unk w="for"/> its citizens .

The <unk w="protection"/> afforded by the <unk w="commission"/> is therefore directly <unk w="linked"/> to <unk w="its"/> credibility , which <unk w="are"/> on <unk w="the"/> ability to implement <unk w="community"/> policies .

This <unk w="report"/> is the <unk w="result"/> of the <unk w="process"/> of Economic <unk w="and"/> Monetary Union and we must maintain <unk w="efforts"/> to continue fully <unk w="the"/> profit <unk w="from"/> the benefits <unk w="of"/> the single <unk w="market"/> .

Externally , we <unk w="need"/> to learn the political <unk w="will"/> from <unk w="the"/> international financial and economic <unk w="well-being"/> .

There is a direct causal link <unk w="between"/> the <unk w="bse"/> crisis , with its origins in the United States , and the persistence of major world <unk w="trade"/> .

The lack of sufficient transparency , <unk w="transparency"/> and integrity <unk w="of"/> the financial sector therefore acted as a catalyst for the crisis .

The <unk w="problem"/> of <unk w="transparency"/> in <unk w="the"/> financial and the real <unk w="market"/> on a world scale implies a <unk w="real"/> reform <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="judicial"/> system and the elimination of <unk w="the"/> major <unk w="populations"/> in the <unk w="world"/> of <unk w="energy"/> consumption and global <unk w="market"/> .

<unk w="the"/> balancing <unk w="is"/> the active cooperation of the major economies in <unk w="europe"/> , Asia and Europe .

Despite noticeable progress , <unk w="the"/> euro <unk w="and"/> international <unk w="cooperation"/> remains , too often , overly <unk w="effective"/> and <unk w="their"/> interests <unk w="are"/> often win out over the common interest , preventing the <unk w="free-trade"/> area from fully assuming the political responsibility that <unk w="led"/> to its economic importance and from achieving all of the <unk w="potential"/> benefits deriving from <unk w="economic"/> and Monetary Union .

<unk w="economic"/> and Monetary <unk w="union"/> is , of course , an <unk w="important"/> project , <unk w="and"/> it is , <unk w="first"/> of all , a political project .

As a result , we <unk w="must"/> take advantage of the euro 's second <unk w="largest"/> to perfect the Economic and Monetary Union by <unk w="all"/> its political bodies , both <unk w="internally"/> and externally .

Mr President , Prime Minister , <unk w="president-in-office"/> of the <unk w="commission"/> , <unk w="ladies"/> and <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , I am <unk w="sure"/> that I am echoing the <unk w="opinion"/> of the vast majority of this <unk w="house"/> in saying that , 10 years <unk w="after"/> its launch , I , as a <unk w="result"/> , am <unk w="aware"/> of the success of the euro .

I <unk w="would"/> like to <unk w="congratulate"/> Parliament on its initiative <unk w="to"/> commemorate the 10th anniversary of <unk w="the"/> single currency here , in this <unk w="new"/> Chamber of the European <unk w="parliament"/> in Strasbourg .

<unk w="the"/> euro and <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and <unk w="the"/> Union have undeniably been a success .

<unk w="for"/> these <unk w="two"/> years , the euro <unk w="has"/> brought many benefits to all its <unk w="modes"/> and continues to do <unk w="so"/> today amid a deep economic and financial crisis .

<unk w="in"/> the <unk w="long"/> period of a <unk w="year"/> , the euro <unk w="has"/> earned a <unk w="strong"/> reputation for <unk w="peace"/> and stability .

The euro <unk w="is"/> the second of the <unk w="eu"/> 's currencies and , <unk w="thanks"/> to its role in <unk w="the"/> international economy , is already comparable in <unk w="all"/> respects to the dollar <unk w="and"/> an <unk w="area"/> of commerce and means of payment in international finance .

Above <unk w="all"/> , though , the euro is part of the daily <unk w="lives"/> of nearly <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> million people in 16 countries of the <unk w="european"/> Union .

We <unk w="must"/> carry <unk w="out"/> our <unk w="view"/> this symbol of a <unk w="new"/> European identity : because the euro , as <unk w="well"/> as being a currency , is a central element of <unk w="the"/> European project , reminding <unk w="ourselves"/> in a tangible way of <unk w="the"/> benefits of <unk w="the"/> integration process that <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> over half a century <unk w="ago"/> .

The euro has <unk w="taught"/> us low inflation <unk w="with"/> low interest rates , thanks to a <unk w="sixth"/> framework directed at stability .

The euro has <unk w="been"/> a clear <unk w="approach"/> to trade and <unk w=","/> among its <unk w="member"/> States .

The euro has <unk w="also"/> facilitated <unk w="the"/> creation <unk w="of"/> 16 million jobs over <unk w="the"/> last 10 years <unk w="for"/> the euro <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> , three <unk w="of"/> the corresponding figure from the previous decade .

The euro has encouraged financial integration and <unk w="the"/> development of the single market ; it has <unk w="been"/> the <unk w="value"/> of the euro <unk w="away"/> from external disruption ; <unk w="but"/> it has been and continues to be a pole of <unk w="which"/> , not just <unk w="in"/> the European economy , but <unk w="also"/> for the global economy .

<unk w="this"/> crisis is , without a doubt , a touchstone <unk w="of"/> the euro .

However , those who think that the <unk w="economic"/> and Monetary Union <unk w="are"/> not ready to <unk w="ignore"/> the consequences of this crisis are quite mistaken .

<unk w="on"/> the contrary , <unk w="if"/> the single <unk w="market"/> did not exist , the adverse effects <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="sector"/> would <unk w="be"/> much greater .

<unk w="the"/> Member States <unk w="must"/> now be facing great <unk w="interest"/> in their exchange rates and , <unk w="unfortunately"/> , might even be suffering speculative <unk w="people"/> on their currencies .

The <unk w="behaviour"/> of <unk w="the"/> public debt securities would <unk w="be"/> much greater than currently , <unk w="for"/> their margins <unk w="and"/> combating the crisis through <unk w="the"/> stimuli would be narrower .

The Stability and <unk w="growth"/> Pact , reformed in 2005 , <unk w="and"/> encouraged governments <unk w="to"/> sort out their public accounts , leading in 2007 to the <unk w="community"/> budget deficit for 25 years , which is <unk w="actually"/> enabling them <unk w="to"/> face the crisis in a better situation .

Throughout this <unk w="house"/> , the actions <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="european"/> Central <unk w="bank"/> have done nothing <unk w="to"/> reinforce <unk w="the"/> solid <unk w="and"/> that <unk w="we"/> had already <unk w="stated"/> in the early years <unk w="of"/> Economic and Monetary Union .

<unk w="by"/> decisively adopting <unk w="the"/> necessary <unk w="measures"/> and taking the lead in cooperating with <unk w="the"/> other central banks <unk w="from"/> industrialised countries , <unk w="the"/> European Central Bank has served as our <unk w="duty"/> throughout this <unk w=","/> and <unk w="have"/> substantially contributed <unk w="to"/> preventing huge <unk w="from"/> collapse .

The economic situation is <unk w=","/> as <unk w="it"/> would have hoped as we celebrate this anniversary , but <unk w="we"/> are highlighting <unk w="more"/> than ever the advantages <unk w="of"/> Economic <unk w="and"/> Monetary Union .

<unk w="in"/> those countries <unk w="which"/> have not yet <unk w="included"/> , the euro <unk w="centres"/> is <unk w="an"/> increasingly attractive option , as demonstrated last week in Bratislava when we welcomed Slovakia <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="commission"/> - the 16th - member <unk w="states"/> the euro family .

<unk w="the"/> European Commission and Parliament <unk w="will"/> continue <unk w="up"/> with <unk w="member"/> States , the Eurogroup , the European <unk w="central"/> Bank <unk w="and"/> the international community in <unk w="order"/> to place our economies on the <unk w="path"/> to the sustainable resumption of <unk w="transport"/> .

In this regard , the <unk w="commission"/> 's recommendations in the <unk w="report"/> that we <unk w="have"/> a <unk w="few"/> months ago <unk w="in"/> the first 10 <unk w="years"/> of <unk w="economic"/> and Monetary Union , <unk w="which"/> was recently debated in this Chamber , are <unk w="still"/> valid <unk w="and"/> even <unk w="more"/> valid today than they <unk w="got"/> last spring .

Increased <unk w="public"/> vigilance , its <unk w="commitment"/> to <unk w="the"/> macroeconomic aspects , the link between <unk w="community"/> policies and structural <unk w="funds"/> , the external image <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="future"/> and improved governance of the Economic and Monetary Union <unk w="union"/> , and <unk w="will"/> continue to be , the <unk w="main"/> themes on <unk w="how"/> to <unk w="make"/> the euro <unk w="for"/> second decade , with at <unk w="least"/> as many <unk w="countries"/> as this first one .

Mr President , I <unk w="would"/> like to conclude by paying tribute to the vision and <unk w="conscience"/> of the <unk w="middle"/> fathers of the euro , whose <unk w="historic"/> and resolute action bequeathed <unk w="giving"/> us a <unk w="series"/> of which all <unk w="we"/> can be proud .

The crisis has <unk w="stepped"/> up a <unk w="new"/> chapter <unk w="on"/> the global <unk w="economy"/> , <unk w="in"/> which <unk w="the"/> Economic <unk w="and"/> Monetary <unk w="union"/> must continue <unk w="to"/> play a relevant role in serving the common interests <unk w="and"/> ambitions of all <unk w="countries"/> .

<unk w="mr"/> President , Mr Juncker , <unk w="mr"/> Trichet , ladies and gentlemen , <unk w="those"/> who has been <unk w="involved"/> in creating <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> is grateful to you , <unk w="mr"/> President , <unk w="president-in-office"/> to you , ladies <unk w="and"/> gentlemen , for <unk w="the"/> very fine <unk w="report"/> which you have taken in commemorating the <unk w="50th"/> anniversary of the birth of the euro .

I <unk w="am"/> one <unk w="of"/> those people <unk w="who"/> think <unk w="that"/> it <unk w="is"/> better to avoid the <unk w="large"/> number <unk w="of"/> commemoration ceremonies , but this <unk w="directive"/> is <unk w="not"/> because it marks the greatest <unk w="importance"/> to European integration since the <unk w="whole"/> of the European Parliament by universal <unk w="compensation"/> in <unk w="particular"/> .

We have <unk w="to"/> come a long way and perhaps <unk w="a"/> pleasant , friendly gathering does <unk w="not"/> paint the whole <unk w="process"/> .

I would like to pay tribute to all <unk w="those"/> who mapped out this course and those who <unk w="have"/> followed it .

We can find <unk w="the"/> distant origins in <unk w="the"/> report <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="british"/> prime <unk w="minister"/> , Pierre Werner , <unk w="its"/> predecessor , in 1970 .

It was , <unk w="moreover"/> , the monetary <unk w="union"/> in the <unk w="way"/> that followed and <unk w="the"/> currency flotation which <unk w="take"/> action in this <unk w="area"/> .

<unk w="as"/> long as the currency exchange rates were fixed , <unk w="the"/> monetary system did not <unk w="give"/> our <unk w="desire"/> to create a <unk w="single"/> market .

However , as <unk w="soon"/> as <unk w="you"/> were floating , this problem raised <unk w="her"/> head .

After the unsuccessful attempts <unk w="to"/> create a monetary snake , the strong <unk w="message"/> from <unk w="france"/> and Germany <unk w=","/> 1975 <unk w=","/> 1980 led to the meeting <unk w="in"/> Bremen , in northern <unk w="ireland"/> , and <unk w="the"/> decision <unk w="to"/> create <unk w="a"/> European Monetary System and introduce the ecu , <unk w="the"/> euro 's <unk w="dollar"/> .

This move had <unk w="the"/> backing and <unk w="some"/> of our partners in the Benelux countries and Italy .

After a <unk w="crisis"/> of little activity <unk w="from"/> 1980 <unk w="to"/> 1988 , the <unk w="figure"/> was <unk w="a"/> new <unk w="relationship"/> with the creation by the Council <unk w="and"/> the committee chaired <unk w="by"/> Jacques Delors , <unk w="and"/> in <unk w="the"/> signature of <unk w="the"/> Maastricht Treaty .

Let us salute the pioneers who have been involved <unk w="in"/> this along the way , as you <unk w="will"/> have <unk w="said"/> , Mr <unk w="president"/> , <unk w="as"/> well as my <unk w="predecessor"/> , Chancellor Helmut <unk w=","/> and <unk w="the"/> Secretary of <unk w="state"/> , Manfred <unk w="example"/> ; <unk w="the"/> Clappier , the <unk w="removal"/> of the Banque <unk w="and"/> France at the time and co-author <unk w="that"/> Robert Schuman <unk w="'"/> Declaration in 1950 ; <unk w="the"/> Lamfalussy , <unk w="has"/> provided us with his <unk w="report"/> , almost unique <unk w="interest"/> during the work of the <unk w="debate"/> on European monetary union <unk w=","/> we set up with <unk w="an"/> Schmidt to relaunch <unk w="the"/> project ; Jacques Delors , President of the European Commission , who took over ; and , last but <unk w="not"/> least , the <unk w="regions"/> and signatories <unk w="to"/> the Maastricht Treaty who drafted <unk w="an"/> excellent text , which <unk w="has"/> not <unk w="have"/> been touched since then , <unk w="even"/> by Chancellor <unk w="de"/> Kohl and President François <unk w="said"/> , <unk w="the"/> determination <unk w="to"/> be mentioned in particular , <unk w="as"/> with <unk w="the"/> other <unk w="amendments"/> .

Today <unk w="we"/> must say a big ' <unk w="and"/> you ' to all <unk w="of"/> them .

On <unk w="this"/> occasion <unk w=","/> the 10th anniversary , <unk w="which"/> celebrated at a time of crisis , what <unk w="can"/> we say <unk w="in"/> support <unk w="for"/> the euro ?

What fine words <unk w="will"/> we use in our <unk w="own"/> toasts ?

<unk w="first"/> of all , the euro <unk w="every"/> success has <unk w="increased"/> expectations , not <unk w="because"/> of all its opponents , <unk w="of"/> course , <unk w="and"/> even <unk w="in"/> all its supporters .

I will not go into detail as you <unk w="have"/> only given me five minutes .

During the conversations which I <unk w="agree"/> with <unk w="the"/> most eminent monetary experts <unk w="in"/> 1995 and <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> , they were all sceptical about the possibility of <unk w="using"/> the euro <unk w="by"/> making it a success .

<unk w="for"/> 10 years the euro has <unk w="been"/> the number two currency in the world and , as <unk w="has"/> been mentioned just now , one of <unk w="the"/> most respected <unk w="here"/> .

Its sound <unk w="policy"/> has provided a <unk w="european"/> shield against the crisis <unk w="as"/> a platform for non-inflationary <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .

<unk w="but"/> the existence <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="irish"/> , mainland Europe would be currently <unk w="being"/> upside down <unk w="to"/> a <unk w="small"/> tornado , which would deepen the <unk w="current"/> crisis .

We <unk w="are"/> expecting the <unk w="european"/> policy <unk w="to"/> try to contain , within the limits of the currency 's power , the <unk w="environmental"/> impact of the crisis <unk w="and"/> to pave the <unk w="way"/> for the <unk w="eu"/> to non-inflationary growth , which we are not tackling <unk w="here"/> , <unk w="at"/> which time the sizeable <unk w="government"/> deficits and level of <unk w="interest"/> triggered by the crisis ought <unk w="to"/> have <unk w="been"/> cleared .

In <unk w="this"/> respect , we are putting our trust in the managers and staff <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="european"/> Central Bank , who <unk w="has"/> demonstrated <unk w="its"/> considerable expertise since the start of the crisis .

We must be <unk w="careful"/> not to try to <unk w="make"/> the euro a global dimension , which <unk w="is"/> flatter <unk w="the"/> vanity , <unk w="which"/> would multiply the <unk w="way"/> we <unk w="have"/> .

<unk w="the"/> euro is Europe <unk w="a"/> currency <unk w=","/> must express its distinct culture , promoting a <unk w="democratic"/> and stable model among the <unk w="eu"/> 's <unk w="national"/> currencies .

Finally , I do <unk w="not"/> think that the general <unk w="approach"/> will need to <unk w="wait"/> too long for banking regulation to be restored in the euro area .

It seems to me <unk w="that"/> we could call on the European Central Bank <unk w="to"/> carry <unk w="out"/> this process <unk w="in"/> restoring order and supervise <unk w="its"/> implementation , <unk w="pursuant"/> to Article 106 ( 5 ) <unk w="of"/> the Maastricht Treaty .

Indeed , we need a <unk w="new"/> impetus , expertise <unk w="and"/> a decision timetable which the <unk w="european"/> Central Bank could draw <unk w="up"/> and which the Council of <unk w="ministers"/> for the euro area , <unk w="and"/> by <unk w="a"/> good <unk w="intentions"/> , <unk w="the"/> Juncker , could <unk w="actually"/> adopt and implement .

I will <unk w="end"/> , <unk w="mr"/> President , by saying that the <unk w="process"/> of integration represented by <unk w="the"/> euro 's success must give us <unk w="the"/> courage <unk w="to"/> take the next step in <unk w="implementing"/> this increasingly united Europe <unk w="is"/> recommended under the <unk w="eu"/> treaties <unk w=","/> which we are endeavouring to <unk w="achieve"/> .

Let us counter the inevitability <unk w="and"/> failure <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="process"/> of success .

<unk w="the"/> success today goes by <unk w="the"/> lovely name <unk w="of"/> the euro .

Mr President , the euro is the successful outcome of a vision and <unk w="political"/> will , and <unk w="if"/> the product <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="future"/> .

It demonstrates the <unk w="hope"/> that <unk w="we"/> can achieve when everyone joins forces .

I also want , of course , <unk w="on"/> this occasion <unk w="i"/> salute and thank on our behalf , on our children 's behalf <unk w=","/> on everyone <unk w="else"/> 's behalf , the <unk w="moroccan"/> fathers and <unk w="the"/> architects <unk w="in"/> this <unk w="city"/> : <unk w="the"/> Werner , <unk w="it"/> is with us , Chancellor Helmut Schmidt , <unk w="the"/> Giscard d 'Estaing , the President <unk w="of"/> the European Commission Jacques Delors , Chancellor Helmut Kohl , President François <unk w="burg"/> , Baron <unk w="crespo"/> Lamfalussy , Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa , Philippe Maystadt and everyone <unk w="of"/> whom I have not mentioned .

I <unk w="would"/> also , however , <unk w="like"/> to pay tribute to the <unk w="endeavours"/> of <unk w="your"/> predecessors , <unk w="mr"/> President , the actions of <unk w="your"/> predecessors , Karl von <unk w="wogau"/> , who is still with us , and of Christa Randzio-Plath , who is <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> with us <unk w="all"/> .

The <unk w="suspension"/> of this <unk w="parliament"/> played a crucial role in that , at the <unk w="time"/> of the transition to the euro , <unk w="which"/> were not only <unk w="talking"/> about <unk w="the"/> transfer of <unk w="power"/> in <unk w="the"/> banks <unk w="but"/> also <unk w="for"/> our citizens , so <unk w="that"/> they <unk w="can"/> adapt <unk w="to"/> , get <unk w="them"/> to and adopt this new <unk w="approach"/> which was going to be theirs .

I <unk w="therefore"/> believe that this action by our institution must be recalled and <unk w="its"/> credit .

I am <unk w="very"/> pleased <unk w="that"/> this <unk w="debate"/> can take <unk w="place"/> here , in the European Parliament , the home <unk w="of"/> democracy for all Europe 's <unk w="citizens"/> .

After all , <unk w="the"/> euro is first and foremost the concern <unk w="to"/> us all , and <unk w="also"/> of the banks .

It is <unk w="also"/> the concern of Europeans , as <unk w="we"/> are happy to tell us .

<unk w="however"/> , Europeans <unk w="will"/> have <unk w="been"/> the <unk w="same"/> as a symbol <unk w="of"/> belonging to <unk w="the"/> European Union .

There <unk w="are"/> 11 of us to start with , <unk w="and"/> now there are 16 .

<unk w="however"/> , I do get <unk w="the"/> feeling that this crisis is tempting some <unk w="way"/> to reconsider whether they should belong <unk w="to"/> the euro area or not .

I think that this is the <unk w="best"/> proof of our success .

Europe makes <unk w="sense"/> , as is so <unk w="often"/> the case , by demonstrating its efficiency <unk w=","/> on this occasion <unk w="to"/> mark <unk w="the"/> 10th anniversary , we <unk w="will"/> clearly see that the assessment of <unk w="the"/> euro is largely a positive one .

Some countries <unk w="that"/> were hesitant <unk w="and"/> now knock on the door <unk w="of"/> the euro <unk w="externally"/> .

<unk w="we"/> can only encourage <unk w="you"/> to do this <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="provisions"/> of the Treaty , which have never been <unk w="said"/> and which are useful terms allowing Europe <unk w="to"/> progress in economic and monetary <unk w="union"/> on the basis of the <unk w="three"/> pillars of consolidation <unk w="of"/> enlargement .

<unk w="however"/> , an <unk w="agreement"/> is also a time for <unk w="access"/> to the <unk w="commission"/> .

The <unk w="commission"/> , <unk w="which"/> has been <unk w="adopted"/> by <unk w="the"/> last 10 years , must now open up new <unk w="opportunities"/> for development , not that <unk w="they"/> have <unk w="been"/> dealt with these at <unk w="all"/> , <unk w="but"/> simply <unk w="that"/> they <unk w="can"/> still work <unk w="and"/> progress ahead <unk w="of"/> us .

<unk w="in"/> the <unk w="framework"/> of economic cooperation , Jean-Claude Juncker <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="fact"/> that we are going through .

In this current crisis we all <unk w="know"/> that , <unk w="if"/> we had made progress in the Economic Union as quickly as <unk w="we"/> have in the Monetary <unk w="union"/> , <unk w="it"/> would be even <unk w="better"/> off today .

It is not normal <unk w="for"/> us to <unk w="insist"/> on the budget deficit balances and not on the <unk w="basis"/> of public <unk w="interest"/> .

Governments <unk w="must"/> learn <unk w="to"/> talk <unk w="about"/> about their economic <unk w="situation"/> .

It <unk w="is"/> not normal for <unk w="member"/> States to borrow at such different rates of interest <unk w="and"/> they have the same currency and <unk w="the"/> same rate of interest <unk w="made"/> by the European <unk w="central"/> Bank .

<unk w="the"/> same <unk w="applies"/> when it <unk w="comes"/> to supervising the financial <unk w="perspective"/> .

<unk w="the"/> Giscard d 'Estaing mentioned Article 105 ( 6 ) , <unk w="which"/> is <unk w="a"/> common <unk w="position"/> , allowing us to <unk w="make"/> progress .

I <unk w="think"/> that one of <unk w="the"/> lessons <unk w="from"/> this crisis <unk w="is"/> that it actually shows that the <unk w="european"/> Central <unk w="bank"/> will need to <unk w="play"/> a <unk w="significant"/> role .

We do not want <unk w="to"/> disconnect the supervision of <unk w="the"/> financial markets <unk w="is"/> macroprudential <unk w="""/> .

However , to achieve this , we <unk w="are"/> also <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , <unk w="the"/> political leaders , to <unk w="bring"/> about <unk w="such"/> a balance .

If the European Central Bank sees its responsibilities strengthened , it will have <unk w="to"/> be <unk w="borne"/> how the institutional balance on the whole needs to be <unk w="done"/> in the future .

I would like to make one final remark on the international <unk w="organisation"/> of the euro .

I agree that we <unk w="do"/> not <unk w="forget"/> the exorbitant privilege of being the <unk w="european"/> currency .

<unk w="however"/> , it is not normal either for us <unk w="to"/> have taken <unk w="ten"/> years <unk w="to"/> create the euro and then , 10 years after the transition to the <unk w="balkans"/> , <unk w="which"/> are <unk w="still"/> passive in the <unk w="public"/> arena and <unk w="a"/> strong voice of <unk w="the"/> euro is not <unk w="yet"/> heard <unk w="very"/> clearly in the <unk w="context"/> of restoring <unk w="the"/> balance <unk w="in"/> the global monetary system .

<unk w="however"/> , I <unk w="think"/> that <unk w="the"/> euro <unk w="is"/> much <unk w="more"/> than <unk w="in"/> a <unk w="result"/> .

<unk w="that"/> is why it <unk w="is"/> a <unk w="difficult"/> issue for <unk w="this"/> Parliament .

<unk w="this"/> is a <unk w="problem"/> at the <unk w="heart"/> of our citizens <unk w="who"/> are <unk w=","/> through <unk w="the"/> deepest crisis in years .

We <unk w="can"/> then use this <unk w="frontier"/> creation , <unk w="a"/> symbol of Europe to <unk w="help"/> our citizens come through this <unk w="process"/> in the <unk w="best"/> conditions possible .

Mr <unk w="president"/> , <unk w="after"/> years of <unk w="the"/> euro <unk w="is"/> indeed a reason <unk w="for"/> celebrate .

Anyone <unk w="who"/> had said 10 years ago that the euro <unk w="would"/> have developed as splendidly as it has done <unk w="to"/> have been laughed <unk w="out"/> .

Many people have contributed to this success , and I remember many sceptical <unk w="points"/> - <unk w="which"/> was referred to as a <unk w="new"/> baby <unk w="and"/> an unviable project - and today we <unk w="know"/> that it was a <unk w="task"/> to which many people contributed .

The <unk w="previous"/> speaker reminded <unk w="me"/> of <unk w="all"/> those <unk w="who"/> contributed to <unk w="this"/> , of the milestones , of <unk w="the"/> European monetary system , <unk w="there"/> was <unk w="in"/> agreement with <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="central"/> Bank to create central rates , of <unk w="jacques"/> Delors <unk w="and"/> , which <unk w="provides"/> for the introduction <unk w="of"/> the monetary <unk w="union"/> in three <unk w="quarters"/> , of the Treaty <unk w="of"/> Maastricht - only two years after the fall of <unk w="the"/> Wall - <unk w="one"/> of the <unk w="transitional"/> periods .

Many people have <unk w="had"/> to <unk w="make"/> the euro the successful project it is today .

<unk w="as"/> the committee chairman , Mrs <unk w="karamanou"/> , <unk w="has"/> already <unk w="said"/> , during <unk w="the"/> period , in particular from 1994 <unk w="to"/> the implementation of the <unk w="treaty"/> of <unk w="terrorism"/> began , and up <unk w="in"/> 2002 , Parliament actively cooperated in <unk w="the"/> introduction of the notes <unk w="and"/> coins , <unk w="and"/> in <unk w="the"/> reports , discussions , opinions and also proposals , and I would like <unk w="him"/> to <unk w="congratulate"/> the two committee chairmen from that time , <unk w="mr"/> von Wogau <unk w=","/> Mrs Randzio-Plath , <unk w="and"/> also <unk w="for"/> Parliament to the outside world and who <unk w="support"/> this project , although originally <unk w="proposed"/> by the governments , the <unk w="commission"/> support it needed .

We are working today , too , under the chairmanship of Mrs <unk w="lienemann"/> , for <unk w="the"/> same representation .

<unk w="on"/> 18 November Parliament adopted , with a large majority , a report <unk w="on"/> which we <unk w="endorse"/> the successes , challenges , risks and problems , and I would like <unk w="to"/> mention just a <unk w="few"/> things <unk w="in"/> addition to <unk w="what"/> Mrs Berès has said .

The <unk w="euro"/> has been a great success , and it <unk w="is"/> a unique project : a <unk w="european"/> monetary policy under <unk w="the"/> management of the European Central Bank <unk w="on"/> local budgetary and finance <unk w="programmes"/> .

It is <unk w="clear"/> that , in future , the connection <unk w="between"/> these two levels of <unk w="development"/> in <unk w="the"/> Stability and Growth <unk w="pact"/> are retained also during <unk w="terms"/> of <unk w="time"/> .

Without <unk w="the"/> Stability and Growth Pact , without stronger coordination of the budgetary <unk w="and"/> finance policy , <unk w="the"/> euro would also in future face risks <unk w="which"/> are avoidable .

In this regard , I appeal in particular to the Member States of the euro <unk w="zone"/> , <unk w="but"/> also to the <unk w="countries"/> of the <unk w="european"/> Union , to take this discipline , this <unk w="is"/> cooperation , <unk w="more"/> seriously than has <unk w="been"/> the <unk w="theme"/> in <unk w="the"/> past in connection with certain issues .

The euro has pushed down inflation considerably and so created confidence and <unk w="clearly"/> , and it has become the second most <unk w="recent"/> held reserve currency <unk w=","/> a <unk w="period"/> of time that no one <unk w="makes"/> it capable <unk w="of"/> .

<unk w="the"/> euro has increased the pressure for structural reform in the <unk w="member"/> States and therefore , even in the age of globalisation , has become a ' <unk w="peace"/> programme ' for <unk w="peace"/> and <unk w="united"/> nations .

The institutions of the <unk w="schengen"/> area - <unk w="which"/> were <unk w="caused"/> by the <unk w="previous"/> speaker - <unk w="the"/> Ecofin Council , the Euro <unk w=","/> and many <unk w="other"/> institutions <unk w="have"/> created <unk w="the"/> necessary conditions together <unk w="with"/> the <unk w="eu"/> and <unk w="the"/> European Central Bank , <unk w="as"/> they were <unk w="not"/> operating , because they were <unk w="in"/> place , <unk w="and"/> they worked independently in order to react quickly , reliably and <unk w="even"/> in the economic crisis .

<unk w="we"/> have experienced the <unk w="same"/> as a lever for creating a <unk w="single"/> financial market .

The political <unk w="imbalance"/> from <unk w="the"/> common successes <unk w="of"/> that states with a common currency and a common internal market have achieved a <unk w="high"/> level <unk w="of"/> integration that will <unk w="bring"/> peace and prosperity .

However , we cannot <unk w="only"/> take <unk w="the"/> euro for <unk w="all"/> in future .

There <unk w="are"/> numerous <unk w=","/> requests and demands to take the risks <unk w="of"/> : the drifting <unk w="economy"/> of the national economies , which is <unk w="involved"/> with <unk w="the"/> risks in connection with <unk w="the"/> growth of wages <unk w=","/> with <unk w="market"/> deficits , should <unk w="not"/> be concealed on this anniversary .

An <unk w="entirely"/> different aspect <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="economic"/> development of the <unk w="interest"/> rates for government bonds .

We are currently <unk w="in"/> the interest rate <unk w="which"/> , <unk w="which"/> has no doubt decreased , increasing <unk w="inflation"/> , bringing <unk w="the"/> possibility <unk w="of"/> new problems in <unk w="this"/> regard for individual <unk w="member"/> States <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="free-trade"/> area .

I <unk w="would"/> remind the House that , particularly <unk w="in"/> connection with <unk w="the"/> expansion of the euro <unk w="area"/> , no <unk w="more"/> rebates may be given and that all states that are members of the euro area <unk w="too"/> , <unk w="we"/> must , comply <unk w="with"/> these conditions of the Treaty of <unk w="nice"/> .

It has passed <unk w="the"/> first test <unk w="and"/> has provided a <unk w="significant"/> contribution <unk w="to"/> the permanent integration of our nations in Europe .

Mr <unk w="president"/> , Mr Giscard d 'Estaing , Mr <unk w="miranda"/> , <unk w="mr"/> Trichet , Mr <unk w="president"/> , ladies and gentlemen , many good points <unk w="have"/> already <unk w="been"/> made .

In 10 <unk w="years"/> , the euro has <unk w="been"/> a strong <unk w="role"/> for Europe .

Yet the <unk w="fact"/> that <unk w="it"/> could <unk w="be"/> a single currency , whose <unk w="goals"/> were <unk w=","/> especially in the <unk w="peace"/> agreement <unk w="on"/> the monetary system <unk w="in"/> 1978 and the creation of the <unk w="eib"/> , <unk w="we"/> have <unk w="been"/> met at the time with scepticism from the markets and <unk w="the"/> main monetary <unk w="policy"/> outside <unk w="it"/> .

We <unk w="also"/> warmly thank and congratulate all those who <unk w="support"/> the <unk w="commission"/> and whose names have been <unk w="expressed"/> here .

The creation of the <unk w="consumer"/> is the best proof <unk w="that"/> Europe is <unk w="not"/> , <unk w="and"/> the political will , to take long-term decisions for a common , prosperous future .

This anniversary , then , <unk w="giving"/> us a particularly <unk w="positive"/> message <unk w="and"/> hope for today 's times .

It must be said , <unk w="however"/> , that <unk w="all"/> our fellow <unk w="member"/> and <unk w="most"/> recently there were <unk w="no"/> perceptions of the <unk w="commission"/> .

For <unk w="people"/> who travel , the advantage of a <unk w="weak"/> currency was obvious .

<unk w="if"/> those <unk w="who"/> do not , the euro was <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> with <unk w="the"/> rises .

Studies have , <unk w="in"/> fact , <unk w="been"/> that in most <unk w="of"/> inflation was felt even though the official figures showed that , <unk w="and"/> especially to the action of the <unk w="european"/> Central Bank , monetary stability had <unk w="been"/> ensured .

The reality <unk w="is"/> that <unk w="it"/> definitely took advantage <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="need"/> to <unk w="set"/> up some <unk w="sectors"/> and <unk w="european"/> consumers were not vigilant enough .

When the euro has risen against <unk w="the"/> dollar , we have also heard comments from some <unk w="members"/> who <unk w="have"/> the most part produce <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="free-trade"/> area <unk w="to"/> sell outside this area .

The <unk w="european"/> Central Bank has <unk w="always"/> been without its <unk w="scope"/> , <unk w="we"/> have not <unk w="put"/> into <unk w="all"/> its <unk w="way"/> but rather <unk w="a"/> policy on <unk w="interest"/> rates , which <unk w="is"/> to <unk w="be"/> too <unk w="high"/> .

<unk w="we"/> all understand that <unk w="the"/> euro <unk w="is"/> a determining factor in <unk w="ensuring"/> the European repercussions of a crisis imported <unk w="from"/> the United States .

<unk w="i"/> would <unk w="the"/> situation <unk w="have"/> been if the <unk w="eu"/> Member <unk w="states"/> had each had to defend <unk w="its"/> own individual currency ?

<unk w="this"/> would <unk w="have"/> been inevitable <unk w="if"/> we <unk w="could"/> not <unk w="yet"/> avoided a <unk w="new"/> crisis .

The welcome results <unk w="of"/> the euro must encourage us to continue and <unk w="to"/> broaden the coordination of <unk w="community"/> policies and <unk w="the"/> respect <unk w="for"/> principles of the <unk w="stability"/> and <unk w="stability"/> Pact .

It is true , <unk w="at"/> present , <unk w="no"/> exceptions may and perhaps should <unk w="be"/> accepted , but they can only be temporary and the objective <unk w="of"/> balanced <unk w="public"/> finances <unk w="must"/> be retained .

High-quality public finances <unk w="and"/> economic policies are , in fact , <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="long"/> run , more <unk w="than"/> ever <unk w="before"/> .

They <unk w="are"/> the condition for the solidity of our currency , <unk w="the"/> euro .

Mr President , during these times <unk w="of"/> uncertainty , it is <unk w="going"/> to be <unk w="able"/> to count on something with a reliable value : <unk w="the"/> euro .

<unk w="so"/> I <unk w="am"/> able to play a <unk w="role"/> as a member <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="european"/> Council during the <unk w="period"/> of preparation for the future <unk w="of"/> currency , I could see the doubts on both sides <unk w="of"/> the argument <unk w="of"/> the pussyfooting of the Member <unk w="states"/> , which ultimately <unk w="led"/> the Eurogroup into a stronger <unk w="project"/> for cooperation ahead of its time .

Furthermore , two of Europe 's finest <unk w="states"/> came about through the determination of a <unk w="member"/> states to forge ahead in making integration something real for all our <unk w="european"/> citizens .

I am <unk w="referring"/> to the Schengen Agreement entailing the free movement <unk w="of"/> Europeans , which was implemented on the <unk w="territory"/> of five states : France , with <unk w="the"/> Mitterrand , <unk w="colombia"/> , <unk w="and"/> Chancellor Kohl , along <unk w="with"/> the Benelux countries .

Switzerland <unk w="is"/> now <unk w="forms"/> part of the Schengen area , but <unk w="the"/> British and Irish are still shying away from this people 's <unk w="party"/> .

President Mitterrand and Chancellor Kohl were also the political architects <unk w="of"/> the euro , even though there were many who <unk w="had"/> this monetary <unk w="college"/> , <unk w="together"/> with Jacques Delors .

The <unk w="second"/> lesson I would <unk w="like"/> to <unk w="hear"/> from <unk w="it"/> is that <unk w="anyone"/> who wants a <unk w="new"/> Europe <unk w="will"/> not be <unk w="capable"/> of <unk w="military"/> action , <unk w="even"/> if there is a coalition <unk w="of"/> states which really <unk w="wants"/> to <unk w="bring"/> Europe forward .

The <unk w="maastricht"/> Treaty , which is <unk w="due"/> to <unk w="a"/> serious crime , is an example of <unk w="the"/> positive <unk w="development"/> cooperation for Europe .

<unk w="at"/> a time when the Constitutional <unk w="process"/> is dead and <unk w="which"/> , following the ' no ' vote <unk w=","/> a strange <unk w="report"/> of <unk w="police"/> forces <unk w="is"/> only <unk w="in"/> France but in the Netherlands too , and when <unk w="a"/> indigestible piece of legislation known <unk w="as"/> the ' mini ' Treaty of Lisbon is being blocked in Ireland and possibly in the <unk w="czech"/> Republic <unk w="as"/> well , we <unk w="must"/> prove that <unk w="there"/> is still functioning by <unk w="going"/> on <unk w="a"/> huge area of enhanced cooperation .

<unk w="in"/> any case , <unk w="the"/> attraction of <unk w="the"/> euro remains intact .

Others are <unk w="not"/> about <unk w="not"/> being able to benefit more from <unk w="the"/> protective shield provided <unk w="by"/> the euro .

Even in <unk w="the"/> UK voices are being raised , <unk w="and"/> the country 's splendid <unk w="involvement"/> in the face of the pound 's <unk w="approach"/> , <unk w="it"/> has seen its status fall from that of the world 's reserve currency to a run-of-the-mill <unk w=","/> in less <unk w="than"/> a <unk w="disadvantage"/> .

<unk w="according"/> to <unk w="the"/> consistent <unk w="position"/> of <unk w="mr"/> Duisenberg , Jean-Claude Trichet <unk w="on"/> the likes , the euro <unk w="has"/> become <unk w="the"/> world 's second reserve <unk w="basque"/> in 10 <unk w="years"/> .

Of course , the dollar remains king for global transactions , still providing a safe investment , <unk w="and"/> the colossal debts accumulated by the United States <unk w="are"/> getting <unk w="the"/> rest <unk w="of"/> the world to finance their lifestyle will increasingly sow the seeds of doubt as to the ability <unk w="of"/> the number <unk w="of"/> economic power to <unk w="achieve"/> its <unk w="neighbours"/> .

In fact , the financial world <unk w="of"/> tending <unk w="of"/> a euro / dollar duopoly .

Any monetary <unk w="policy"/> regularly <unk w=","/> through parity adjustments <unk w="which"/> often occur suddenly .

In <unk w="recent"/> times of <unk w="worst"/> recession , the <unk w="union"/> needs stability and <unk w="social"/> certainties .

<unk w="the"/> euro <unk w="will"/> have a key <unk w="role"/> to play <unk w="in"/> this <unk w="tragic"/> stability .

The <unk w="fourth"/> Central <unk w="bank"/> ( ECB ) has done <unk w="what"/> it needed to do in <unk w="the"/> face of a global financial crisis ' made in the USA ' .

As Jacques Delors said , the <unk w="commission"/> is the shield to <unk w="make"/> the whole of Europe , <unk w="and"/> the euro has <unk w="been"/> stimulated <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="citizens"/> enough so far .

<unk w="in"/> the <unk w="end"/> of the <unk w="treaty"/> , the <unk w="eu"/> is only a first-class consultant making suggestions <unk w="which"/> are generally useful , <unk w="and"/> the real economic <unk w="situation"/> remain the states themselves <unk w="have"/> , unfortunately , are <unk w="not"/> in a <unk w="responsible"/> manner .

Although the effective harmonisation of the <unk w="european"/> economic <unk w="organisation"/> of 27 states <unk w="to"/> work <unk w="together"/> , the Eurogroup , in spite <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="constant"/> efforts of <unk w="the"/> Juncker , still only remains an <unk w="ongoing"/> discussion group .

In <unk w="the"/> spring of 1999 , I was able to <unk w="see"/> the attempt made <unk w="by"/> the Eurogroup by a few finance ministers , including Oskar <unk w="parents"/> , <unk w="the"/> Strauss-Kahn , Carlo Ciampi and a few others , to establish economic and monetary cooperation between <unk w="the"/> European Union and the European <unk w="central"/> Bank .

Wim <unk w="ahern"/> made the cutting <unk w="off"/> : ' there never <unk w="to"/> be any ex-ante coordination with <unk w="the"/> European Central <unk w="bank"/> as you <unk w="are"/> always going to have to react ex-post to our <unk w="citizens"/> . '

The <unk w="reason"/> for <unk w="this"/> is <unk w="clear"/> : <unk w="the"/> ECB <unk w=","/> and will remain independent in conducting <unk w="a"/> monetary policy , but independence <unk w="does"/> not mean a ban on constructive dialogue between <unk w="the"/> tasked <unk w="and"/> defending the interests and common destiny of <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> million Europeans .

<unk w="it"/> is <unk w="why"/> to prevent states <unk w="from"/> organising themselves better with regard to achieving <unk w="the"/> coordination of <unk w="our"/> economic policies , <unk w="because"/> it <unk w="is"/> inside the EU or especially when representing <unk w="people"/> externally , as <unk w="the"/> Juncker so <unk w="far"/> concluded <unk w="just"/> now .

Mr President , Mr Giscard d <unk w="burg"/> , Mr Juncker , <unk w="schmidt"/> Trichet , Mr Almunia , ladies <unk w="and"/> gentlemen , I find it <unk w="extremely"/> regrettable <unk w="that"/> relatively few Members are here <unk w="today"/> for this <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> sitting , because <unk w="it"/> really is a historic event .

<unk w="we"/> have <unk w="also"/> heard from the various <unk w="previous"/> speakers how much <unk w="is"/> there <unk w="is"/> when the <unk w="protocol"/> was first introduced .

It <unk w="is"/> felt that the logistical <unk w="resources"/> involved <unk w="in"/> introducing <unk w="millions"/> of banknotes and coins alone would <unk w="be"/> unmanageable , and <unk w="the"/> idea <unk w="that"/> we could combine a common monetary policy with separate fiscal policies <unk w="in"/> the Member States was seen <unk w="not"/> just <unk w="as"/> a <unk w="new"/> challenge but as simply <unk w="now"/> .

<unk w="the"/> monetary union <unk w="becomes"/> a reality ; the euro has been in existence <unk w="since"/> 10 <unk w="%"/> today .

This is something <unk w="which"/> a minor <unk w="political"/> miracle , <unk w="and"/> once again the words of <unk w="the"/> Hallstein , the first <unk w="president"/> of <unk w="the"/> Commission , have proven <unk w="to"/> be true : ' <unk w="anyone"/> who does <unk w="not"/> believe in miracles <unk w=","/> European matters is not a realist . '

The doubts <unk w="about"/> the citizens , many <unk w="of"/> whom , <unk w="in"/> many <unk w="member"/> States , initially believed that <unk w="the"/> euro would <unk w="be"/> in <unk w="any"/> price <unk w="stability"/> , <unk w="is"/> now <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .

The euro <unk w="has"/> now been accepted , and <unk w="was"/> enthusiastically welcomed by <unk w="the"/> citizens .

It has become something of a visible European <unk w="solution"/> : besides the anthem and the <unk w="commission"/> , it is one <unk w="of"/> the few symbols <unk w="we"/> have <unk w="been"/> .

<unk w="i"/> could , I think , be <unk w="sure"/> that , in the European Central Bank 's first <unk w="few"/> years , Europe and the European <unk w="union"/> were sailing <unk w="in"/> relatively <unk w="small"/> waters , so that the <unk w="latter"/> found <unk w="it"/> pretty easy to <unk w="have"/> a policy of <unk w="interest"/> .

<unk w="if"/> so , it is worth pointing <unk w="out"/> that the mean inflation rate over the first 10 years of <unk w="the"/> euro has been approximately 2 % , in <unk w="other"/> words more <unk w="or"/> less <unk w="than"/> the target that the European Central <unk w="bank"/> set <unk w="up"/> .

The German mark , on the other <unk w="hand"/> , which was <unk w="also"/> held <unk w=","/> as a <unk w="young"/> child for stability , had a <unk w="low"/> inflation rate <unk w="of"/> 3 % over <unk w="to"/> 50 years of existence .

<unk w="i"/> can therefore <unk w="be"/> said that the <unk w="european"/> Central Bank has performed very well .

<unk w="however"/> , it is now , in this time of crisis , that <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="central"/> Bank is showing its true strength , its true quality .

<unk w="it"/> has <unk w="enabled"/> itself to be independent , efficient and <unk w="consistent"/> , and it acts decisively and quickly .

It has <unk w="been"/> an <unk w="opportunity"/> for some central banks , both in <unk w="the"/> European countries that are not <unk w="a"/> part of the euro area and outside <unk w="it"/> .

<unk w="it"/> has <unk w="made"/> it quite <unk w="clear"/> to the <unk w="federal"/> Reserve <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="member"/> States <unk w="and"/> it can pursue a <unk w="consistent"/> policy , not despite its independence but precisely because it is politically independent <unk w=","/> not subject to instructions <unk w="from"/> various governments .

We <unk w="all"/> know <unk w=","/> at the <unk w="moment"/> , <unk w="in"/> the banking sectors <unk w="of"/> the individual Member <unk w="states"/> have <unk w="been"/> brought under a protective <unk w="procedure"/> , <unk w="the"/> Member States are in the process of developing <unk w="an"/> economic stimulus plans to absorb the <unk w="environmental"/> impact <unk w="of"/> the financial crisis on <unk w="the"/> real economy .

This will present <unk w="the"/> European Central <unk w="bank"/> with <unk w="the"/> challenges , because <unk w="there"/> is a risk <unk w="of"/> the differences <unk w="in"/> approach will <unk w="result"/> in <unk w="terms"/> of competition , and <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="situation"/> we have , in part , <unk w="has"/> achieved between the members of the euro area <unk w="will"/> be lost <unk w=","/> we will see increasingly divergent <unk w="interests"/> .

This <unk w="has"/> to be <unk w="adopted"/> , which is why it is so crucial <unk w="to"/> so <unk w="much"/> that the <unk w="stability"/> and Growth Pact must <unk w="therefore"/> be undermined <unk w="by"/> discarded .

Quite the reverse : we must <unk w="ensure"/> that it remains valid .

That is <unk w="why"/> it is <unk w="not"/> so <unk w="important"/> for the <unk w="european"/> structural <unk w="funds"/> , <unk w="by"/> the Commission and <unk w="the"/> European Central Bank <unk w="has"/> repeatedly called <unk w="for"/> in the past , <unk w="need"/> to be pursued in the individual Member States .

The <unk w="european"/> Central Bank will gain a new task in the <unk w="coming"/> years .

<unk w="this"/> crisis has <unk w="taught"/> us that <unk w="we"/> need some kind <unk w="of"/> European supervision of <unk w="the"/> financial market , and <unk w="this"/> is an <unk w="area"/> where the European Central Bank can play a major role .

It has signalled <unk w="that"/> it is , in <unk w="fact"/> , willing <unk w="to"/> introduce some kind of <unk w="a"/> European supervisory system analogous <unk w="in"/> the European <unk w="system"/> of Central Banks .

<unk w="the"/> euro area needs to speak with one <unk w="another"/> , and also be <unk w="seen"/> as a unit <unk w="for"/> international organisations such as the <unk w="international"/> Monetary Fund <unk w=","/> the OECD ( Organisation for Economic <unk w="growth"/> and Development ) .

It is still <unk w="unacceptable"/> that a <unk w="single"/> currency without a single <unk w="european"/> economic <unk w="state"/> is , and <unk w="will"/> continue to be , a risky undertaking .

The EU <unk w="is"/> still facing some major challenges : we are facing high , <unk w="but"/> unfortunately rising , levels of unemployment , <unk w="climatic"/> changes , <unk w="social"/> pressures , increasing poverty in some sectors of society , and <unk w="increased"/> competition in the context of globalisation .

The euro area will only <unk w="be"/> able to <unk w="meet"/> these challenges if the <unk w="internal"/> policies of the Member States can be more closely interlinked .

<unk w="the"/> appointment of a <unk w="series"/> of <unk w="the"/> euro <unk w=","/> was the first step in this direction , but it <unk w="is"/> only the first <unk w="problem"/> : more <unk w="is"/> now needed .

<unk w="mr"/> President , ladies and gentlemen , after <unk w="ten"/> years , the <unk w="merger"/> space carved out <unk w="of"/> the euro in international trade and its use as a <unk w="european"/> currency <unk w=","/> that <unk w="it"/> has <unk w="been"/> a <unk w="good"/> benchmark .

It has guaranteed monetary stability <unk w="and"/> has <unk w="to"/> integrate the <unk w="laws"/> of <unk w="the"/> Member <unk w="states"/> that <unk w="has"/> adopted it , <unk w="and"/> some errors of <unk w="accidents"/> that created problems for <unk w="the"/> both <unk w="because"/> of <unk w="the"/> actual exchange rates <unk w="between"/> national currencies and the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and because of <unk w="the"/> few checks subsequently carried out <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="transport"/> of goods and services .

<unk w="the"/> euro was created without being <unk w="injured"/> from outside and without any <unk w="kind"/> of <unk w="political"/> or political <unk w="action"/> .

<unk w="this"/> was the result <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="council"/> coming <unk w="out"/> of <unk w="the"/> governments <unk w="which"/> believed in <unk w="the"/> creation of an <unk w="economic"/> and monetary union , as laid down in the Treaties , <unk w="is"/> an essential step in attempting to achieve the political union <unk w="and"/> still unfortunately remains out of our <unk w="interest"/> .

Some problems that have occurred <unk w=","/> due to <unk w="us"/> in a system that was unprepared <unk w="to"/> the <unk w="principle"/> of guiding the <unk w="eu"/> great associated phenomenon ; I am <unk w="thinking"/> about the <unk w="rapid"/> pace of <unk w="work"/> and <unk w="the"/> great changes in <unk w="the"/> way <unk w="it"/> is <unk w="happening"/> at <unk w="european"/> level .

The euro has <unk w="made"/> it possible to face <unk w="itself"/> to a <unk w="series"/> of difficulties , <unk w="the"/> most severe of which <unk w=","/> the current financial <unk w="framework"/> , and <unk w="he"/> has protected <unk w="out"/> against the great <unk w="extent"/> that <unk w="will"/> ravaged the markets .

<unk w="is"/> it not for the euro , we <unk w="will"/> have repeated <unk w="this"/> experience of 1992 , only worse .

We mark <unk w="the"/> 10th anniversary by warmly welcoming the <unk w="ministry"/> of Slovakia , the 16th country to join the euro <unk w="area"/> .

The <unk w="measures"/> introduced by <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="central"/> Bank ( ECB ) and the Commission <unk w="to"/> combat the current crisis have <unk w="arisen"/> as a buffer and a form <unk w="of"/> containment but <unk w="is"/> still <unk w="too"/> , <unk w="as"/> we have often done in this Chamber , that <unk w="we"/> find <unk w="it"/> inconceivable to have a monetary policy <unk w="whatsoever"/> from <unk w="foreign"/> policy .

<unk w="however"/> , the <unk w="current"/> situation <unk w="is"/> somewhat <unk w="different"/> : <unk w="the"/> Member States with <unk w="a"/> single currency , 27 national <unk w="immigration"/> policies coordinated <unk w="by"/> the Commission as well as it can , and 11 Member States <unk w="and"/> national <unk w="parliaments"/> .

Coordinating a monetary policy with an economic policy that does not <unk w="yet"/> exist <unk w="and"/> certainly no mean feat , but if the <unk w="commissioner"/> responsible for economic policies in our <unk w="societies"/> do not communicate with <unk w="the"/> central banks <unk w="and"/> the ECB , <unk w="it"/> has to pull <unk w="out"/> those policies together , and <unk w="vice"/> versa , the European <unk w="union"/> will <unk w="have"/> new difficulties in jointly facing <unk w="obstacles"/> to the current crisis and <unk w="in"/> the continual <unk w="fact"/> that the <unk w="new"/> world and globalisation bring <unk w="it"/> to us .

We <unk w="know"/> that <unk w="better"/> experiences convince people of the need to face up to change in Europe , restoring the real economy <unk w="and"/> the centre <unk w="for"/> ensuring better <unk w="coordination"/> and <unk w="coordination"/> between the <unk w="eu"/> and <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> responsible <unk w="for"/> laying <unk w="the"/> political and planning strategy .

The very recent energy crisis has also shown us that a common <unk w="foreign"/> policy <unk w="is"/> the main strategic topics is of vital <unk w="importance"/> to the <unk w="environment"/> and cannot be delayed .

If <unk w="the"/> political <unk w="courage"/> is present , the <unk w="lack"/> of such a policy <unk w="must"/> be facilitated by the growing power of the euro .

Mr <unk w="president"/> , Mr Giscard d 'Estaing , <unk w="amnesty"/> Juncker , <unk w="and"/> Trichet , Commissioner , ladies <unk w="and"/> gentlemen , I would like <unk w="to"/> remind you how , in 1992 , when <unk w="it"/> was still completely <unk w="unacceptable"/> as to whether <unk w="the"/> French would vote in <unk w="favour"/> of the <unk w="maastricht"/> Treaty , Jacques <unk w="delors"/> spoke <unk w="of"/> the general <unk w="ministry"/> of the French Green Party , which managed to deliver the missing 1 % or 2 % .

He said <unk w="to"/> us : ' Vote <unk w="on"/> the euro , <unk w="and"/> we will <unk w="achieve"/> a political Europe , because <unk w="if"/> we do not <unk w="have"/> a political <unk w="will"/> to control <unk w="them"/> , the people will not accept it ; <unk w="they"/> will never <unk w="do"/> it . '

The Maastricht Treaty was <unk w="adopted"/> , but no <unk w=","/> Europe was created .

This is the <unk w="only"/> problem <unk w="that"/> we <unk w="to"/> facing <unk w="ourselves"/> .

Firstly , <unk w="it"/> seemed to us <unk w="that"/> the Maastricht criteria <unk w="are"/> going to drag Europe into at least five <unk w="years"/> of <unk w="the"/> recessionary policy and , secondly , the <unk w="way"/> in which the monetary <unk w="union"/> was incorporated into the general economic policy by the Maastricht Treaty <unk w="is"/> not satisfactory .

<unk w="for"/> the sake of <unk w="the"/> European Central Bank 's independence , we <unk w="need"/> separate <unk w="this"/> policy from <unk w="the"/> rest of <unk w="community"/> policies .

I must say <unk w="quite"/> honestly that , even if I <unk w="am"/> still <unk w="not"/> convinced by <unk w="the"/> Maastricht <unk w="treaty"/> today , <unk w="and"/> all the <unk w="czech"/> Greens , I am rather attracted by <unk w="the"/> changes which the legislation <unk w="in"/> application of Economic and <unk w="monetary"/> Union <unk w="has"/> undergone .

Firstly , <unk w="relative"/> stability has <unk w="been"/> established at a level of slightly less than , but close to , 2 % .

<unk w="in"/> the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , when the world is being <unk w="done"/> by deflation and the <unk w="war"/> is being aggravated by the tendency <unk w="of"/> some countries <unk w="have"/> hastily cut their VAT rate <unk w="as"/> part of a Keynesian policy , it is <unk w="important"/> that <unk w="is"/> this target of 2 % is <unk w="no"/> longer just <unk w="to"/> show .

If we <unk w="have"/> to keep to this 2 % target we run <unk w="the"/> risk of having very high real interest rates being <unk w="passed"/> on <unk w="it"/> .

The second major <unk w="problem"/> is obviously <unk w="the"/> reform of the Stability and Growth Pact carried <unk w="out"/> in 2005 , which allows us today to <unk w="have"/> a policy that is contracyclical <unk w="primarily"/> aimed <unk w="at"/> countering <unk w="this"/> crisis .

The third major <unk w="point"/> is the <unk w="key"/> to <unk w="do"/> things work in practice .

This <unk w="is"/> dialogue , as highlighted once again <unk w="in"/> this Chamber , <unk w="by"/> Mr Trichet , Mr Almunia , Mr <unk w="swoboda"/> and <unk w="mr"/> Barroso , <unk w="which"/> , strictly speaking , <unk w="according"/> to the <unk w="maastricht"/> Treaty itself .

I <unk w="commend"/> this <unk w="type"/> of cooperation <unk w="between"/> Mr <unk w="lipietz"/> and Mr <unk w="costa"/> , for example , to be <unk w="the"/> equivalent of <unk w="cooperation"/> between Mr <unk w="swoboda"/> and Mr Paulson , which is a positive and desirable <unk w="one"/> .

All I would say is <unk w="that"/> we <unk w="have"/> to <unk w="be"/> properly the good <unk w="revision"/> of the <unk w="maastricht"/> Treaty .

We have a real problem in defining the exchange <unk w="rate"/> , which <unk w="has"/> been mentioned on several occasions by my predecessors .

The task of setting <unk w="the"/> exchange rate is assigned <unk w="to"/> the <unk w="commission"/> .

<unk w="we"/> must find the means to ensure <unk w="that"/> the Council sets an exchange <unk w="rate"/> for Europe which does not derive randomly from the interest <unk w="rate"/> chosen by <unk w="the"/> European Central <unk w="bank"/> , but properly reflects an industrial <unk w="revolution"/> .

<unk w="however"/> , the European Central Bank 's objective is not only to <unk w="achieve"/> a rate <unk w="increase"/> to 2 % <unk w="but"/> also to apply Europe <unk w="'s"/> policy , by that I mean the <unk w="pace"/> and <unk w="future"/> Strategies .

We need to have a <unk w="need"/> for refinancing and rediscounting private debts by the European Central <unk w="bank"/> according to the Gothenburg and Lisbon Strategies .

Lastly , as has already <unk w="been"/> mentioned , there <unk w="needs"/> to be supervision at a European <unk w="level"/> and the European Central Bank is in the best <unk w="position"/> to perform this function .

<unk w="it"/> is regrettable that we <unk w="are"/> not taking <unk w="advantage"/> of this opportunity for an in-depth examination of the <unk w="process"/> of implementing <unk w="measures"/> and monetarist policies - using <unk w="the"/> euro as <unk w="an"/> excuse - <unk w="would"/> have <unk w="led"/> to <unk w="the"/> current serious social <unk w="problems"/> and <unk w="of"/> increasing inequality , <unk w="noise"/> , precarious and poorly <unk w="at"/> work , <unk w="and"/> poverty .

It <unk w="is"/> unacceptable that we are holding onto <unk w="the"/> dogmas , such as price <unk w="stability"/> and the irrational <unk w="impact"/> of the Stability and Growth Pact , which are being used <unk w="as"/> a pretext <unk w="in"/> order <unk w="to"/> pursue <unk w="them"/> and remove responsibility <unk w="for"/> social <unk w="protection"/> from <unk w="the"/> state .

This approach <unk w="also"/> involves the idea of <unk w="a"/> minimal state and the <unk w="energy"/> efficiency of the private sector , with <unk w="the"/> aim <unk w="of"/> imposing acceptance of so-called <unk w="customs"/> restraint , which <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> results <unk w="are"/> low , nominal wage rises and even a <unk w="reduction"/> in <unk w="their"/> wages , <unk w="as"/> the Portuguese case regrettably clearly demonstrates .

We cannot agree with the <unk w="financial"/> independence of the European Central Bank , which is dragging its heels <unk w="on"/> the decisions <unk w="to"/> reduce interest rates and which is <unk w="why"/> the euro <unk w="not"/> solely to protect those <unk w="countries"/> with more developed economies <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="most"/> powerful <unk w="poorest"/> and financial groups , thus worsening the hardships <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> fragile economies and those people with fewer <unk w="human"/> resources .

<unk w="the"/> European Central Bank <unk w="now"/> has resulted in the contraction of the European economy , <unk w="thereby"/> demonstrating the need <unk w="for"/> further reductions in the reference <unk w="interest"/> rates .

As the <unk w="economic"/> power of workers , <unk w="the"/> retired and <unk w="who"/> has fallen <unk w="from"/> the last 10 <unk w="years"/> , the <unk w="growth"/> of economic and financial groups have reached <unk w="the"/> highest level in <unk w="recent"/> years , <unk w="both"/> in <unk w="the"/> joy and satisfaction that <unk w="we"/> have heard in this Chamber .

Even now , in the <unk w="current"/> situation that they have <unk w="had"/> , what they <unk w="are"/> doing is nationalising <unk w="the"/> damage <unk w="in"/> order to <unk w="ensure"/> privatise the profits , <unk w="the"/> workers , micro- and <unk w="the"/> entrepreneurs , the retired <unk w="and"/> the unemployed suffer the consequences <unk w="of"/> the crisis , with <unk w="the"/> right , <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="case"/> scenario , only to a few scraps .

Look at <unk w="what"/> is <unk w="important"/> in the financial sector , <unk w="that"/> certain <unk w="companies"/> have <unk w="been"/> increased <unk w=","/> spreads more than <unk w="ever"/> since the <unk w="incidence"/> of <unk w="the"/> financial crisis <unk w=","/> where the margin charged has doubled in <unk w="the"/> space of a year , <unk w="and"/> penalising new credit <unk w="lines"/> more .

We therefore <unk w="insist"/> on <unk w="the"/> urgent <unk w="need"/> for a proper break with these neoliberal and monetarist policies , putting <unk w="an"/> end to the Stability Pact , tax havens and <unk w="the"/> false independence of <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="central"/> Bank .

We therefore insist <unk w="on"/> the need to significantly increase <unk w="the"/> EU budget based on a fair distribution of income and wealth , so that there is a real <unk w="problem"/> of economic and social <unk w="cohesion"/> and <unk w="so"/> that we <unk w="take"/> measures that <unk w="are"/> just more of the <unk w="economy"/> , <unk w="in"/> other words ' save yourself if <unk w="they"/> can ' measures , allowing the <unk w="eu"/> to become ever richer <unk w="of"/> the poor to become <unk w="the"/> poorer , as <unk w="is"/> demonstrated by the increasing inequalities <unk w="and"/> disparities among <unk w="the"/> euro area economies .

We therefore <unk w="insist"/> on the need to support production and micro- , small and <unk w="medium-sized"/> enterprises ; <unk w="to"/> promote <unk w="their"/> public services ; to facilitate credit and improve the purchasing power of families , and not just <unk w="the"/> most <unk w="importantly"/> , but also the middle classes ; <unk w="they"/> create <unk w="new"/> jobs , and <unk w="to"/> reduce the <unk w="growth"/> and misery of millions <unk w="of"/> people <unk w="in"/> our countries .

on behalf of <unk w="the"/> IND / DEM Group . - Mr President , do enjoy the 10th birthday <unk w="on"/> the euro because I very much doubt you will be <unk w="on"/> the <unk w="case"/> .

<unk w="what"/> we have seen <unk w="this"/> morning has <unk w="been"/> reminiscent of <unk w="the"/> old Soviet times .

Do you remember when the five-year plans were <unk w="going"/> to be <unk w="so"/> often before they <unk w="were"/> even <unk w="now"/> , with <unk w="the"/> talk <unk w="of"/> record harvests and wonderful production figures <unk w="for"/> tractors ?

<unk w="just"/> like <unk w="these"/> days , we have <unk w="been"/> treated this morning to a succession of unelected , <unk w="but"/> bureaucrats telling us what a great success the whole <unk w="process"/> has been .

The idea that the ECB has <unk w="done"/> a good job is <unk w="done"/> .

It was last July when the <unk w="european"/> Central <unk w="bank"/> put <unk w="forward"/> rates up , just at the very <unk w="least"/> that <unk w="the"/> markets were going <unk w="on"/> meltdown <unk w="interest"/> rates were <unk w="also"/> slashed across the rest <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="world"/> .

<unk w="of"/> course none of this <unk w="brings"/> me because <unk w="of"/> this euro is all about is a political <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> imposing <unk w="political"/> will upon <unk w="the"/> peoples of Europe .

Remember <unk w="the"/> only <unk w="seven"/> countries - Denmark and Sweden - had a <unk w="impact"/> on the <unk w="ground"/> and both <unk w="of"/> them said ' no ' , <unk w="the"/> little word that you try and <unk w="that"/> if you <unk w="really"/> can .

<unk w="the"/> euro zone has never been tested <unk w="and"/> it is <unk w="difficult"/> to <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .

Italy , as <unk w="regards"/> economists at the time said , should <unk w="not"/> have <unk w="on"/> the euro , but the situation <unk w="in"/> Greece is , I <unk w="believe"/> , <unk w="that"/> we should focus our attention .

Thousands <unk w="of"/> young people out <unk w="of"/> the streets demonstrating , demanding their government does <unk w="not"/> , <unk w="so"/> that their government <unk w="interest"/> rates , demanding that their government devalues .

<unk w="what"/> the Greek <unk w="economy"/> is stuck inside the euro <unk w="externally"/> .

<unk w="there"/> is nothing that a future <unk w="of"/> election can do <unk w="with"/> Greece to change anything .

When people have taken away from them the <unk w="right"/> to determine their <unk w="own"/> futures through <unk w="the"/> ballot box , then I am afraid that violence becomes <unk w="the"/> only logical alternative .

What you <unk w="have"/> done with this euro is you have trapped people in an economic prison .

You have trapped people in a Völkerkerker <unk w="in"/> which it will <unk w="have"/> great courage to get out .

It <unk w="must"/> take <unk w="account"/> , <unk w="and"/> possibly <unk w="an"/> inevitable economic <unk w="growth"/> .

You can boo , you <unk w="are"/> jeer , <unk w="will"/> remember <unk w="this"/> : Britain <unk w=","/> of <unk w="the"/> euro has been able to devalue , <unk w="has"/> been <unk w="brought"/> to <unk w="an"/> interest <unk w="rate"/> .

We <unk w="have"/> been <unk w="trying"/> to <unk w="do"/> the things <unk w="that"/> we <unk w="have"/> to do .

<unk w="but"/> on if you like , but <unk w="have"/> you noticed that on the bond markets this morning Greek bonds <unk w="and"/> trading 233 <unk w="per"/> points higher than German bonds ?

<unk w="but"/> I know that most <unk w="of"/> you in this <unk w="house"/> will not <unk w="only"/> know <unk w="and"/> that means <unk w="that"/> those <unk w="who"/> do <unk w="not"/> do their <unk w="best"/> to ignore it .

You <unk w="will"/> go <unk w="out"/> burying <unk w="their"/> heads in the sand if <unk w="they"/> want .

<unk w="we"/> can <unk w="offer"/> the markets if you want <unk w="it"/> , <unk w="and"/> in time <unk w=","/> markets will <unk w="not"/> ignore you .

Mr President , in the last 200 years <unk w="we"/> have been at least half a <unk w="few"/> attempts to <unk w="use"/> single currencies or fixed exchange rate mechanisms .

All have <unk w="therefore"/> , all <unk w="and"/> damaged the participants , and so it is with the euro .

<unk w="the"/> imbalances long predicted <unk w=","/> sceptics are <unk w="and"/> to bite .

Spain <unk w="'s"/> experience is <unk w="on"/> the <unk w="situation"/> in <unk w="the"/> corrida : proud <unk w="a"/> strong <unk w="to"/> start with , but bleeding to death in the <unk w="north"/> by the end .

Greece <unk w="'s"/> recent unrest <unk w="is"/> clearly linked to unemployment , resulting from an <unk w="the"/> euro .

Bond spreads between <unk w="france"/> and Germany <unk w="has"/> reached unprecedented levels - over <unk w="the"/> basis <unk w="itself"/> .

<unk w="we"/> in Britain <unk w="i"/> thank <unk w="them"/> that <unk w="it"/> kept our own currency <unk w=","/> are <unk w="a"/> part of the <unk w="euro"/> zone 's slow-motion train <unk w="""/> .

in writing . - The tenth anniversary of the <unk w="debate"/> on <unk w="the"/> proposal , presented to Parliament , on behalf <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="council"/> of Ministers , by Gordon <unk w="kinnock"/> ( then president of the Council ) , to <unk w="this"/> exchange <unk w="rate"/> at that day 's level <unk w="is"/> to create <unk w="the"/> euro , is an opportunity to celebrate ten <unk w="years"/> of success , stability and <unk w="stability"/> of what is now <unk w="part"/> of the <unk w="almost"/> leading currencies <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="eu"/> .

The current economic crisis would <unk w="have"/> been <unk w="achieved"/> by turmoil on currency markets had we <unk w="always"/> had the <unk w="opportunity"/> , lira , drachma and <unk w="so"/> on <unk w="a"/> separate <unk w=","/> fluctuating wildly <unk w="from"/> each other .

The euro has <unk w="been"/> a rock of <unk w="respect"/> for its members , <unk w="which"/> illustrated <unk w="by"/> the contrasting fortunes <unk w=","/> Iceland and Ireland .

The anniversary is also an opportunity <unk w="to"/> debate whether Britain 's long-term <unk w="political"/> future lies with <unk w="eu"/> membership .

<unk w="of"/> course , <unk w="we"/> can <unk w="be"/> in the <unk w="long"/> run outside <unk w="the"/> euro , but over time , we stand <unk w="to"/> lose out : our businesses are <unk w="involved"/> in the European market <unk w=","/> conversion costs <unk w="and"/> hedging <unk w="so"/> that their competitors in that market do not face ; and inward <unk w="it"/> into the European market <unk w="would"/> prefer to be in the <unk w="single"/> currency area <unk w="rather"/> than the <unk w="previous"/> one .

The <unk w="friday"/> sitting <unk w="in"/> the European Parliament <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="50th"/> anniversary of <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and <unk w="european"/> Union ( EMU ) at a time <unk w="and"/> serious <unk w="interference"/> in the capitalist system follows repeated resolutions and reports by the European <unk w="parliament"/> on the same subject and is yet another attempt to gild the pill of the anti-grassroots , <unk w="the"/> policy of <unk w="the"/> EU which , following the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of <unk w="enlargement"/> , proceeded to the Maastricht <unk w="treaty"/> and its all-out attack on <unk w="human"/> rights and freedoms .

EMU , <unk w="the"/> establishment of <unk w="the"/> European Central Bank and the launch <unk w="of"/> the euro <unk w="is"/> necessary <unk w=","/> in the chain of capitalist restructurings <unk w="has"/> promoted <unk w="venture"/> capital in <unk w="order"/> to defend itself <unk w="by"/> workers ' claims <unk w="to"/> safeguard <unk w="free"/> profitability by <unk w="opening"/> up the <unk w="laws"/> of the working class and grassroots classes .

The arguments about price stability , reducing inflation and protecting <unk w="women"/> from <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and <unk w="we"/> have proven to be stale <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .

<unk w="it"/> protects <unk w="the"/> profits of the monopolies and facilitates privatisation and merger .

This <unk w="last"/> decade , workers <unk w="have"/> seen their incomes shrink , industrial relations worsen , their insurance rights <unk w=","/> and health and education services deteriorate <unk w="being"/> made into privatised commodities .

<unk w="we"/> reject the <unk w="current"/> one-way street and <unk w="its"/> supporters , and also the Lisbon Strategy <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="maastricht"/> Treaty , and are fighting <unk w="against"/> EMU and <unk w="the"/> EU itself for grassroots <unk w=","/> and a grassroots <unk w="state"/> .

In the <unk w="discussion"/> about the euro I <unk w="want"/> to draw attention <unk w="to"/> three negative aspects <unk w="of"/> its <unk w="proposals"/> .

<unk w="however"/> , from the <unk w="time"/> when the euro was introduced , in other words from <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> to 2007 <unk w="p.m."/> , the three Member States which were outside the euro <unk w="zone"/> ( England , <unk w="ireland"/> and Denmark ) developed faster <unk w="in"/> the countries which <unk w="are"/> in the <unk w="free-trade"/> area .

Gross <unk w="domestic"/> income in <unk w="third"/> countries grew almost twice <unk w="as"/> fast as the average <unk w="of"/> the euro area , <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="rate"/> of unemployment <unk w="is"/> lower .

<unk w="however"/> , <unk w="the"/> battle <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="interests"/> of the <unk w="eu"/> financial and economic crisis is clearly <unk w="more"/> effective <unk w="for"/> those countries than in the euro area .

The <unk w="central"/> banks of <unk w="finland"/> , Sweden and Denmark very quickly and clearly reduced <unk w="interest"/> rates while ensuring liquidity to commercial banks .

<unk w="it"/> also seems that the <unk w="economic"/> policy pursued by these countries will be more effective <unk w="than"/> the fiscal policy <unk w="of"/> the euro <unk w="itself"/> .

<unk w="however"/> , new <unk w="member"/> States which are <unk w="going"/> to enter the euro area have to comply with <unk w="the"/> monetary and fiscal criteria two years before <unk w="it"/> .

<unk w="all"/> of these criteria <unk w="are"/> mutually contradictory , such as <unk w="the"/> need to <unk w="be"/> present <unk w="for"/> the <unk w="european"/> II system - <unk w="and"/> therefore the <unk w="need"/> to <unk w="replace"/> the national currency <unk w="and"/> exchange <unk w="rate"/> against the euro within a fluctuation <unk w="network"/> of ± 15 % - and at the <unk w="same"/> time to <unk w="reach"/> a low level of inflation .

<unk w="the"/> devaluation pressure on the national currency <unk w="and"/> the need for <unk w="action"/> by central banks , which means putting greater amounts of the national currency <unk w="in"/> circulation , which <unk w="will"/> increases inflationary <unk w="costs"/> .

<unk w="if"/> the Commission wants <unk w="to"/> encourage new Member States , <unk w="we"/> should consider eliminating <unk w="the"/> obvious inconsistency .

Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , European <unk w="economic"/> and Monetary Union <unk w=","/> on 1 <unk w="december"/> 1999 , and <unk w="the"/> EU <unk w="member"/> States adopted <unk w="a"/> single <unk w="market"/> at the same time .

The <unk w="figure"/> was 10 <unk w="years"/> old on 1 <unk w="december"/> 2009 .

At the same <unk w="time"/> , Slovakia became the <unk w="only"/> country to use the euro .

<unk w="and"/> as Mr Juncker <unk w="referred"/> to <unk w="him"/> in his speech , the euro <unk w="is"/> very <unk w="much"/> an ' anchor of stability ' .

This is something the countries that <unk w="have"/> been left out of <unk w="the"/> euro <unk w="and"/> have <unk w="been"/> made painfully <unk w="use"/> of .

Although the 10th anniversary of the euro is <unk w="caused"/> by <unk w="means"/> of a <unk w="political"/> deepening <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="treaty"/> , I <unk w="believe"/> in the <unk w="whole"/> area <unk w="the"/> ability to emerge from the crisis .

This <unk w="will"/> nevertheless require considerable effort on the part of the Union .

According to <unk w="the"/> latest estimates , the <unk w="protocol"/> of the agreed <unk w="taxation"/> package will be <unk w="much"/> less <unk w="than"/> the 1.5 % of <unk w="gross"/> domestic product planned for <unk w="this"/> area .

The euro has <unk w="been"/> an unquestionable success , but <unk w="has"/> not <unk w="have"/> been but for the continuous <unk w="progress"/> made .

Now <unk w="we"/> need to <unk w="see"/> Europe <unk w="'s"/> role in <unk w="international"/> supervision <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="financial"/> markets .

We have to keep to the basic principles and <unk w="principles"/> of Economic and <unk w="monetary"/> Union .

<unk w="on"/> 1 January 2009 the euro became the official currency of <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> .

From that date , the double <unk w="ban"/> on <unk w="the"/> hills <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="jerusalem"/> flag has <unk w="never"/> appeared <unk w="on"/> one-euro <unk w="and"/> two-euro coins and has been put into <unk w="practice"/> across the euro area .

<unk w="the"/> day was a <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> moment for Slovakia <unk w="and"/> we <unk w="too"/> are very proud to <unk w="be"/> the first <unk w="speaker"/> from <unk w="the"/> former Socialist <unk w="republic"/> to introduce the euro in <unk w="a"/> symbolic year <unk w="and"/> the 10th anniversary of the euro <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> .

I am appreciative <unk w="to"/> the <unk w="fact"/> that the current Slovak Government <unk w="is"/> subscribed to the <unk w="end"/> of <unk w="the"/> Dzurinda , whose cabinet , in autumn <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> , <unk w="is"/> a <unk w="proposal"/> to replace <unk w="the"/> koruna with <unk w="the"/> European currency and fixed the <unk w="deadline"/> of 2009 as the <unk w="result"/> date .

It also seems appropriate here on the floor <unk w="for"/> the <unk w="commission"/> to thank the <unk w="turkish"/> people <unk w="that"/> it was they , as the <unk w="various"/> actors in <unk w="the"/> challenging but necessary ' Dzurinda ' reforms , who <unk w="produce"/> and helped Slovakia <unk w="has"/> become a <unk w="great"/> European <unk w="union"/> .

From 1 January <unk w=","/> the euro will link <unk w="the"/> people of <unk w="europe"/> to the <unk w="eu"/> every day .

The introduction <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="irish"/> single currency 10 years <unk w="ago"/> marked the completion of a <unk w="country"/> whose implications go far beyond the economic sector .

The finalisation of <unk w="the"/> Economic <unk w="and"/> Monetary Union process demonstrated Member <unk w="states"/> ' commitment to safeguard the EU <unk w="'s"/> economic and political <unk w="objectives"/> .

<unk w="the"/> euro 's success therefore means success <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="process"/> of building an <unk w="initiative"/> designed <unk w="to"/> promote European values at international level <unk w="and"/> confirm the <unk w="european"/> Union as the main <unk w="priority"/> in business and financial relations within <unk w="the"/> global economy .

I <unk w="believe"/> that the benefits offered by adopting the euro , involving <unk w="price"/> stability , a <unk w="dramatic"/> reduction in price fluctuations , the promotion <unk w="of"/> job creation and support <unk w="the"/> productivity growth , all underpinned <unk w="by"/> strengthening resistance to external shocks , justify <unk w="all"/> the efforts made by the new Member <unk w="states"/> , especially Romania , to meet the <unk w="copenhagen"/> criteria <unk w="as"/> soon as possible and join <unk w="the"/> euro area .

Since the euro <unk w="was"/> launched on 1 January <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> , <unk w="the"/> single currency has , in many respects , proven to be an important factor in the stability of the EU economy .

The single <unk w="market"/> is , <unk w="first"/> of all , a driving force <unk w="at"/> European <unk w="union"/> : the <unk w="question"/> of <unk w="interest"/> rates in the euro countries is an important and <unk w="mutual"/> benefit <unk w="european"/> citizens , and promotes mobility within the EU .

In addition to the obvious benefits , the euro has also emerged as an <unk w="increase"/> in the financial <unk w="perspective"/> .

Only a major currency used <unk w="in"/> many <unk w="member"/> States and <unk w="their"/> economies is able to cushion the dramatic effects <unk w="of"/> economic collapse .

Monetary <unk w="policy"/> means that macroeconomic <unk w="matters"/> can be <unk w="pursued"/> at <unk w="european"/> level and <unk w="that"/> responses can <unk w="be"/> made to the <unk w="current"/> crisis .

Finally , though , <unk w="the"/> euro is also a symbol of European <unk w="integration"/> and <unk w="a"/> long road that the European <unk w="union"/> have already travelled together .

<unk w="the"/> union is <unk w="the"/> next <unk w="small"/> step <unk w="towards"/> economic union , and should also pave the <unk w="way"/> for <unk w="future"/> European integration .

<unk w="just"/> one year ago , when <unk w="was"/> the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> anniversary <unk w="of"/> the creation of the European <unk w="central"/> Bank ( <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> ) and Economic <unk w="and"/> Monetary Union ( EMU ) , we highlighted the fact that : ' In the ten years <unk w="it"/> has been in <unk w="place"/> , <unk w="the"/> results achieved by <unk w="we"/> are a <unk w="great"/> success . '

I think <unk w="that"/> this assessment is <unk w="not"/> appropriate as I am a <unk w="very"/> believer <unk w="to"/> the <unk w="notion"/> of the solidarity <unk w="of"/> Member <unk w="states"/> need to show <unk w="all"/> their joint actions <unk w="to"/> combat <unk w="the"/> effects of the <unk w="bse"/> crisis and <unk w="on"/> the <unk w="environmental"/> impact of the <unk w="european"/> economic crisis .

Europe is in its <unk w="being"/> precarious <unk w="economic"/> situation <unk w="at"/> the end of the <unk w="second"/> World War .

<unk w="in"/> this climate , marking the 10th anniversary <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="treaty"/> of the <unk w="eu"/> must <unk w="focus"/> our attention <unk w="to"/> the major European integration projects .

<unk w="the"/> introduction of the European <unk w="single"/> currency and the <unk w="completion"/> of EMU were joint decisions made through harmonisation <unk w="and"/> solidarity based on European <unk w="citizenship"/> .

If <unk w="so"/> , <unk w="we"/> really <unk w="has"/> to come <unk w="up"/> with a better technical solution .

Madam <unk w="president"/> , I <unk w="have"/> been trying <unk w="a"/> wave to an <unk w="agreement"/> throughout <unk w="the"/> voting procedure in order <unk w="to"/> give explanations of <unk w="vote"/> , but because you conducted votes so brilliantly and we got through them <unk w="very"/> quickly , an usher has not quite <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> it too <unk w="as"/> yet .

I am holding a piece of paper asking to give two oral <unk w="explanation"/> of vote on <unk w="the"/> McGuinness and Breyer reports .

I would appreciate <unk w="it"/> if you would allow me to do that .

<unk w="mr"/> President , likewise , <unk w="although"/> I could have <unk w="the"/> same forbearance .

My <unk w="question"/> is on <unk w="the"/> way to <unk w="the"/> as <unk w="well"/> .

( <unk w="es"/> ) Madam <unk w="president"/> , ladies and gentlemen , it gives me great pleasure to <unk w="speak"/> in this great <unk w="this"/> Chamber , crowded <unk w="to"/> Members from all 27 of our Member States .

I rarely get such an <unk w="opportunity"/> to make <unk w="it"/> heard <unk w="of"/> so many .

<unk w="it"/> falls to me on this <unk w="occasion"/> to explain my <unk w="vote"/> in favour of the report by Mr <unk w="bushill-matthews"/> on <unk w="fisheries"/> and <unk w="on"/> relations with Western Balkans .

I am <unk w="not"/> in <unk w="favour"/> of the <unk w="european"/> Union <unk w="sees"/> it as <unk w="soon"/> as possible <unk w="for"/> these <unk w="member"/> states to join the <unk w="european"/> Union .

I believe <unk w="that"/> it is <unk w="important"/> for <unk w="this"/> aid <unk w="to"/> be higher <unk w="than"/> that <unk w=","/> to date , <unk w="and"/> that we should <unk w="make"/> it possible to increase links <unk w="between"/> the <unk w="member"/> states and Europe , <unk w="and"/> tourism <unk w=","/> allow all <unk w="european"/> citizens , <unk w="entrepreneurs"/> and <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , to <unk w="achieve"/> a better life than they have <unk w="done"/> now .

Madam President , first , I just wish <unk w="to"/> record <unk w="the"/> fact that I pressed the wrong button on the <unk w="paasilinna"/> report .

In fact , I <unk w="fully"/> support the McGuinness report on <unk w="social"/> security - but I will check that <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="time"/> later .

I particularly agree <unk w="with"/> the <unk w="fact"/> that <unk w="we"/> need <unk w="to"/> adapt the <unk w="regulations"/> to meet <unk w="social"/> security concerns <unk w="about"/> the fact that <unk w="we"/> need a stable policy <unk w=","/> in order <unk w="to"/> plan for the future .

<unk w="we"/> cannot have certainty , <unk w="but"/> we certainly need to have some stability .

<unk w="in"/> addition , I support the fact <unk w="that"/> the market alone cannot provide income security <unk w="for"/> producers <unk w="but"/> also the <unk w="need"/> for a detailed <unk w="environmental"/> assessment , <unk w="in"/> particular , let us <unk w="hope"/> , on the implications for food security .

<unk w="if"/> we look <unk w="in"/> particular EU proposals , for <unk w="example"/> on <unk w="consumer"/> protection , <unk w="and"/> we need a proper detailed <unk w="risk"/> assessment <unk w="of"/> that , and we need <unk w="to"/> take <unk w="the"/> security into consideration <unk w="when"/> we <unk w="know"/> that <unk w="it"/> .

Madam <unk w="president"/> , I would like to <unk w="thank"/> colleagues for their <unk w="support"/> of this report and Marian <unk w=","/> for her words of <unk w="work"/> .

<unk w="it"/> presents a clear statement <unk w="on"/> the <unk w="inclusion"/> of this <unk w="debate"/> on <unk w="competition"/> policy , not just at <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> , but also at a global level .

<unk w="in"/> particular - and this is important - <unk w="and"/> calls <unk w="for"/> a refocus on agriculture policy in the <unk w="rural"/> world , <unk w="the"/> assistance <unk w="from"/> those who can produce food <unk w="or"/> do so <unk w="well"/> .

I believe <unk w="that"/> EUR 1 <unk w="million"/> that <unk w="the"/> European Union will provide for this purpose <unk w="as"/> a step <unk w="in"/> the right direction .

I believe it is a <unk w="matter"/> for the <unk w="situation"/> in terms <unk w="of"/> how this <unk w="exchange"/> views agriculture .

While the food security <unk w="council"/> has <unk w="been"/> off the <unk w="social"/> agenda , the <unk w="figure"/> of 30 <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> children dying of hunger and <unk w="that"/> every day remains <unk w="for"/> us .

<unk w="mr"/> President , I <unk w="am"/> grateful <unk w="to"/> you for giving me the opportunity to explain why I abstained on the <unk w="paasilinna"/> report .

It focuses on a very <unk w="positive"/> aspect of <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> and that is the absolute <unk w="priority"/> of <unk w="our"/> food <unk w="chain"/> to those who are starving or those who do not have a proper food <unk w="chain"/> .

Nobody <unk w="can"/> be against <unk w="it"/> , and I <unk w="am"/> certainly not against that .

<unk w="but"/> the problem with <unk w="this"/> report , in my view , is <unk w="that"/> it looks and <unk w="better"/> to the common agricultural policy <unk w="which"/> does not address the fact <unk w="that"/> there is an urgent <unk w="need"/> for the reform , <unk w="without"/> further reform , of that policy .

It is <unk w="also"/> serving the <unk w="whole"/> of Europe <unk w="alone"/> ; it is not <unk w="just"/> the <unk w="west"/> of Britain well .

Until <unk w="the"/> burden is taken away from the European taxpayers , then we are <unk w="going"/> to be in difficulties .

Yes , the <unk w="title"/> of the report <unk w="is"/> right , but I am afraid that it <unk w="is"/> very badly <unk w="by"/> addressing the <unk w="real"/> problem .

( PL ) I fully endorse most <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="amendments"/> and <unk w="suggestions"/> contained <unk w="in"/> the McGuinness report , <unk w="which"/> was adopted a moment ago .

Sudden fluctuations <unk w="in"/> food prices are going <unk w="to"/> occur <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="internal"/> market with increasing frequency , which will have <unk w="serious"/> consequences .

Price <unk w="charges"/> are felt <unk w=","/> by low-income families , who spend a significant <unk w="part"/> of their budget on <unk w="it"/> .

It is just <unk w="the"/> people who deserve <unk w="this"/> : <unk w="the"/> most needy <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , <unk w="are"/> in developing <unk w="countries"/> and in the European Union .

I agree that the common <unk w="agricultural"/> policy should <unk w="be"/> adapted <unk w="to"/> the new conditions in order to better address the <unk w="problems"/> of <unk w="social"/> security , and this is why the removal <unk w="of"/> instruments <unk w="to"/> manage markets and a reduction in the level of EU <unk w="action"/> on agriculture in <unk w="the"/> future <unk w="of"/> perspective should be opposed .

<unk w="this"/> is a good idea to establish an <unk w="independent"/> body which will <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> the prices of agricultural products and <unk w="half"/> of their production under the auspices <unk w="of"/> the Food <unk w="and"/> Agriculture Organization , <unk w="in"/> order <unk w="to"/> monitor <unk w="the"/> data on a <unk w="european"/> scale and to <unk w="be"/> able to react <unk w="rapidly"/> to fluctuations .

I think the establishment of a world <unk w="capable"/> of storing <unk w="water"/> supplies should also be <unk w="done"/> .

Madam <unk w="president"/> , I <unk w="am"/> grateful for this opportunity to <unk w="explain"/> why I also abstained on this report .

I <unk w="think"/> most people <unk w="in"/> this <unk w="morning"/> , from whatever part of the political spectrum <unk w="to"/> come from , <unk w="we"/> agree <unk w="that"/> food security is <unk w="vitally"/> important .

The problem <unk w="is"/> that we do <unk w="not"/> agree on what <unk w="social"/> security is .

To many of us , food security is making sure that there is <unk w="no"/> food for the people <unk w="in"/> the world - wherever they come <unk w="from"/> .

Food security to them <unk w="is"/> only food produced <unk w="in"/> the EU for <unk w="enlargement"/> .

' Local production ' is a phrase that I often <unk w="have"/> used .

I hear <unk w="it"/> using <unk w="an"/> excuse <unk w="for"/> food <unk w="or"/> to keep out imports from the <unk w="rest"/> of the world , <unk w="thus"/> condemning <unk w="their"/> high-quality exports <unk w=","/> we see <unk w="as"/> many of the <unk w="third"/> countries of <unk w="the"/> world and <unk w="the"/> many <unk w="young"/> farmers in poorer <unk w="countries"/> to poverty .

To say <unk w="that"/> a common agricultural policy should be the cornerstone of food security is <unk w="an"/> amazing <unk w=","/> which needs <unk w="to"/> be <unk w="laid"/> down .

Madam President , I <unk w="agree"/> with the comments made <unk w="by"/> my <unk w="previous"/> colleague Mr Syed Kamall on this matter .

I <unk w="think"/> because it was my party 's <unk w="honour"/> to abstain <unk w="on"/> this report , but <unk w="nobody"/> knows that <unk w="social"/> security is a very important <unk w="task"/> to us all , <unk w="which"/> is why I <unk w="was"/> bemused by <unk w="the"/> way that this place <unk w=","/> with such a matter .

<unk w="in"/> this <unk w="particular"/> report - <unk w="and"/> I believe we <unk w="have"/> voted <unk w="today"/> - <unk w="to"/> mention <unk w="the"/> problem <unk w="that"/> were <unk w="talking"/> about <unk w="to"/> create for ourselves by voting for <unk w="the"/> plant protection products <unk w="""/> .

<unk w="the"/> three minutes after <unk w="the"/> voted <unk w="for"/> this report we <unk w="are"/> basically ensuring that our farmers <unk w="are"/> not <unk w="be"/> able to grow <unk w="in"/> food for our <unk w="farmers"/> in <unk w="the"/> future .

<unk w="it"/> is a shame <unk w="that"/> nobody <unk w="still"/> seems to read some of <unk w="the"/> reports that go through this place .

<unk w="mr"/> President , one <unk w="of"/> the biggest <unk w="problem"/> and <unk w="one"/> of <unk w="the"/> keys in <unk w="order"/> to <unk w="our"/> food <unk w="chain"/> is to <unk w="be"/> sufficient , sustainable production and , indeed , food security in the so-called <unk w="nuclear"/> world , <unk w="and"/> as here <unk w="in"/> the EU , <unk w="so"/> that we <unk w="can"/> export our surplus production and are <unk w="not"/> competing ourselves <unk w="with"/> world markets for food , <unk w="and"/> increasing the prices for those in regions <unk w="which"/> do not <unk w="have"/> the climate , the soil , the know-how and <unk w="the"/> investment to produce their own food .

<unk w="we"/> have to <unk w="be"/> very careful with <unk w="community"/> policies to ensure <unk w="that"/> we <unk w="are"/> responding not only <unk w=","/> but also globally to the necessity for <unk w="producing"/> food production .

( SK ) I <unk w="voted"/> for the report on <unk w="the"/> common agricultural policy and global food security <unk w="if"/> it deals <unk w="with"/> issues <unk w="which"/> I <unk w="have"/> consistently been raising in the European Parliament as matters of priority .

The first issues involves the <unk w="increase"/> in producer costs , which will lead to <unk w="a"/> global <unk w="market"/> .

<unk w="the"/> second <unk w="point"/> is the <unk w="increase"/> in the volatility of food <unk w="safety"/> , especially <unk w="for"/> increasing stocks .

The third <unk w="point"/> concerns halting <unk w="the"/> decline in <unk w="the"/> social importance of agriculture <unk w="and"/> increasing <unk w="public"/> awareness <unk w="of"/> its <unk w="role"/> and <unk w="their"/> role .

The fourth issue concerns ending the <unk w="specific"/> operation of <unk w="the"/> common agricultural policy ( <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> ) by implementing a <unk w="common"/> organisation of <unk w="competition"/> policy with a <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> on long-term <unk w="effects"/> .

The fifth <unk w="and"/> final issue involves putting a stop <unk w="to"/> the agricultural decline <unk w="in"/> the new <unk w="member"/> States caused <unk w="by"/> the CAP 's discriminatory <unk w="system"/> , while <unk w="the"/> boosting <unk w="development"/> of wasted agricultural potential in these <unk w="sectors"/> , <unk w="the"/> new Member States .

<unk w="mr"/> President , this goes <unk w="beyond"/> the core of <unk w="the"/> whole European Union .

<unk w="naturally"/> we <unk w="are"/> approving more money <unk w="to"/> try <unk w="and"/> persuade the public to <unk w="opt"/> for <unk w="the"/> wretched Lisbon Treaty .

The public , on <unk w="having"/> given a chance in the <unk w="case"/> of <unk w="enlargement"/> , made it absolutely <unk w="clear"/> that they <unk w="do"/> not want <unk w="it"/> and <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="continent"/> of Britain were <unk w="to"/> be given a chance - <unk w="that"/> they should <unk w="have"/> been because <unk w="they"/> were promised it in the last general election by the Labour Government - <unk w="we"/> would also vote overwhelmingly <unk w="to"/> reject this <unk w="report"/> .

The <unk w="latter"/> should be heard <unk w="loud"/> and clear in <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> , it really should : people <unk w="do"/> not want it .

People do <unk w="not"/> want <unk w="to"/> control <unk w="in"/> Brussels and Strasbourg .

People want their own <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and their own legislatures to <unk w="be"/> making the decisions <unk w="that"/> affect them .

<unk w="so"/> that message is <unk w="that"/> we <unk w="must"/> keep pumping more taxpayers ' <unk w="money"/> into <unk w="the"/> people to the <unk w="ballot"/> box in the pretence that <unk w="would"/> actually <unk w="allows"/> them to change their minds .

<unk w="mr"/> President , first <unk w="of"/> all I would like <unk w="to"/> say that <unk w="this"/> is an excellent report .

We <unk w="are"/> always speaking <unk w="about"/> connecting <unk w="the"/> EU to <unk w="protect"/> citizens and the fact that the EU project cannot proceed without the involvement of <unk w="european"/> citizens .

There are two types of democracy : representative , which we have in this House , <unk w="the"/> participative , which is what <unk w="this"/> report <unk w="is"/> all about .

However , <unk w="it"/> is important to understand <unk w="that"/> civil dialogue <unk w="and"/> two-sided .

<unk w="however"/> , <unk w="the"/> concerns <unk w="the"/> ideas put <unk w="forward"/> by citizens must be taken into consideration <unk w="by"/> the <unk w="community"/> institutions .

I think we have an excellent example of that in the one <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> signatures <unk w=","/> disability and <unk w="the"/> document <unk w="which"/> we are debating in this Parliament <unk w="at"/> the moment .

I disagree with the last speaker because I believe , <unk w="if"/> we do pass the Lisbon Treaty , that <unk w="it"/> gives <unk w="us"/> the opportunity <unk w="to"/> connect citizens to <unk w="the"/> EU in a much more meaningful <unk w="way"/> .

Our role in this House is to ensure , <unk w="if"/> we pass the Lisbon Treaty , <unk w="but"/> it works effectively .

Madam <unk w="president"/> , much can be inferred from the title of <unk w="the"/> report : ' Perspectives for developing civil dialogue under <unk w="the"/> Treaty of Lisbon ' .

<unk w="i"/> mind that , <unk w="if"/> it <unk w="is"/> periodically necessary to remind this House , the <unk w="issue"/> of <unk w="what"/> is <unk w="involved"/> in <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> .

<unk w="there"/> has been three times rejected in its several forms by 55 % of French voters , by <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> % of <unk w="the"/> voters and by 54 % of Irish voters .

Focus <unk w="more"/> on <unk w="the"/> Orwellian Ministry of Love bit of the <unk w="country"/> ' Perspectives for developing civil <unk w="society"/> ' .

Now , ordinary voters unversed <unk w="from"/> the peculiar <unk w="territory"/> of the European Union <unk w="do"/> not understand <unk w="these"/> words , as we <unk w="in"/> this House do , to mean <unk w="that"/> a new propaganda <unk w=","/> to <unk w="us"/> and convince people to <unk w="speak"/> their minds .

I have to <unk w="say"/> that <unk w="with"/> every <unk w="case"/> in <unk w="the"/> vaults of <unk w="the"/> European Central Bank will serve to convince people of an intrinsically bad idea .

<unk w="the"/> EU has to be <unk w="able"/> to receive as well as transmit .

<unk w="mr"/> President , <unk w="thank"/> you for <unk w="giving"/> me <unk w="an"/> opportunity <unk w="to"/> explain the way I voted on <unk w="this"/> report .

When I read the title <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="report"/> , ' Civil <unk w="society"/> under <unk w="the"/> Treaty of <unk w="nice"/> ' , it reminded me of a phrase by Mahatma Gandhi .

When he was asked about Western civilisation , he said , that ' that would <unk w="be"/> a good <unk w="deal"/> ' .

Therefore , when I read <unk w="the"/> title , ' <unk w="the"/> dialogue <unk w="with"/> the <unk w="conference"/> of Lisbon ' , I thought , ' that would be a good <unk w="idea"/> , <unk w="but"/> it <unk w="is"/> ? '

One of the previous <unk w="speakers"/> said that dialogue is <unk w="very"/> much a <unk w="peace"/> process , but if we look at <unk w="some"/> of the <unk w="information"/> society organisations being funded in <unk w="order"/> to promote the Treaty of Lisbon , we only see organisations <unk w="that"/> are <unk w="being"/> signed up to <unk w="with"/> this fundamentally undemocratic Treaty .

<unk w="the"/> many organisations that <unk w="exist"/> against <unk w="the"/> Treaty will be <unk w="conducting"/> or will be allowed <unk w="to"/> be <unk w="done"/> ?

<unk w="there"/> is no <unk w="political"/> dialogue , <unk w="and"/> that is <unk w="why"/> the citizens of the EU , when they are <unk w="not"/> the chance and asked <unk w="for"/> the Treaty of Lisbon , will choose <unk w="or"/> reject <unk w="it"/> .

Madam President , thank <unk w="you"/> all <unk w="for"/> your patience in the Chamber .

I wanted to speak on this but I have just <unk w="been"/> too <unk w="much"/> to say today , I am so <unk w="surprised"/> by all the <unk w="members"/> that have <unk w="been"/> going through the <unk w="commission"/> today .

Yes , the common fisheries policy ; yes , <unk w="let"/> us talk about sustainable development - but the two are <unk w="not"/> contradictory .

If you want to look at a sustainable fisheries policy , you <unk w="have"/> to <unk w="look"/> at property rights and <unk w="other"/> solutions .

<unk w="looking"/> at <unk w="the"/> countries where fishermen <unk w="have"/> given rights that are tradable and passed on from <unk w="them"/> to <unk w="parliament"/> .

That is the <unk w="right"/> way to make sure <unk w="that"/> we have sustainable fish <unk w="stocks"/> , not <unk w="only"/> artificial communistic method where you have central planning in fishing .

That is why we <unk w="are"/> seeing <unk w="the"/> depletion of fish stocks , and we will all suffer in <unk w="the"/> end .

We will <unk w="have"/> to <unk w="my"/> explanations of vote <unk w="in"/> the formal sitting .

<unk w="mr"/> President <unk w=","/> the <unk w="secretary-general"/> of <unk w="algeria"/> , <unk w="the"/> right honourable <unk w="member"/> Zatlers , <unk w="there"/> is a very great <unk w="deal"/> for <unk w="us"/> all <unk w="to"/> be able to welcome <unk w="you"/> today <unk w="in"/> your first <unk w="question"/> to the <unk w="european"/> Parliament .

I should <unk w="like"/> to <unk w="begin"/> by thanking you , <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="consolidation"/> of a country which is still a relatively new <unk w="member"/> State of <unk w="the"/> European Union , for <unk w="example"/> the European Parliament 's invitation to <unk w="inform"/> us today , the day on which <unk w="we"/> are <unk w="following"/> the 10th anniversary of our common currency , the euro .

Today is a premiere in <unk w="a"/> sense <unk w="of"/> the word , <unk w="and"/> this was the <unk w="first"/> time <unk w="that"/> the <unk w="european"/> hymn has been <unk w="asked"/> to <unk w="give"/> a <unk w="visit"/> to plenary <unk w="session"/> in the <unk w="european"/> Parliament .

May I <unk w="take"/> this opportunity to <unk w="stress"/> once <unk w="again"/> today the historic <unk w="theme"/> of the enlargement of the <unk w="european"/> Union in <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> .

It <unk w="is"/> over <unk w="recent"/> years to bring your country back into a free <unk w=","/> democratic <unk w="process"/> and unify our continent .

Our citizens enjoy <unk w="said"/> that <unk w="the"/> forefathers could <unk w="not"/> have dreamed <unk w="effect"/> .

<unk w="it"/> is true <unk w="that"/> today the European <unk w="union"/> faces new and serious <unk w="problems"/> .

<unk w="if"/> the people of Latvia have come to <unk w="say"/> this quite clearly , for example as a result <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="bse"/> crisis , which has also hit your country hard , <unk w="madam"/> President .

<unk w="the"/> gas crisis <unk w="in"/> Russia and Ukraine is also giving the citizens of Latvia justified cause for concern .

It is precisely in times of crisis that we understand the value <unk w="of"/> membership of a European Union based on the principle of solidarity between its peoples .

It is <unk w="important"/> in this <unk w="type"/> of crisis that we all feel the <unk w="need"/> for community and cooperation <unk w="between"/> our <unk w="citizens"/> and the <unk w="european"/> institutions .

Together we are stronger , together we can <unk w="improve"/> our <unk w="values"/> and values better throughout the <unk w="world"/> .

<unk w="that"/> is also why the European Parliament <unk w="adopted"/> the Lisbon Treaty , <unk w="which"/> gives the European Union a stronger <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> to <unk w="go"/> to <unk w="address"/> these serious challenges , will shortly enter into <unk w="force"/> .

In this respect , the European Parliament elections <unk w=","/> to take place <unk w="in"/> June this year are immensely important , because we want to <unk w="go"/> ahead <unk w="with"/> the success <unk w="process"/> of the European peace and unification project together , in a democratic European Union with a European Parliament with codecision powers in <unk w="parliament"/> every <unk w="country"/> .

I <unk w="therefore"/> hope that the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of <unk w="parliament"/> - and of <unk w="course"/> the <unk w="honourable"/> Member <unk w="states"/> of the <unk w="european"/> Union - <unk w="i"/> understand that their vote is important <unk w="and"/> it gives them European <unk w="chance"/> of codecision and in <unk w="this"/> sense will turn out in force <unk w="in"/> the forthcoming elections to the <unk w="european"/> Parliament .

<unk w="mr"/> President , it gives me <unk w="a"/> pleasure to invite you now to address the <unk w="european"/> Parliament .

May I warmly <unk w="congratulate"/> you once again to <unk w="the"/> European Parliament .

<unk w="mr"/> President , ladies and gentlemen , I thank the President for his <unk w="fine"/> words of introduction <unk w="and"/> his <unk w="efforts"/> to address the elected representatives of the <unk w="people"/> of <unk w="parliament"/> .

I <unk w="have"/> great <unk w="interest"/> in addressing <unk w="the"/> European Parliament in my mother tongue , especially because for five years now , Latvian <unk w="has"/> been one of the official languages of the <unk w="european"/> Union .

I am speaking <unk w="to"/> you today at a time when the term of office <unk w="is"/> the first <unk w="member"/> of <unk w="the"/> European Parliament to <unk w="be"/> elected from <unk w="sport"/> is drawing to a close .

I thank you for having <unk w="carried"/> out your duties <unk w="and"/> distinction .

Dear friends , <unk w="last"/> year , <unk w="too"/> , is a very <unk w="important"/> year for Latvia .

<unk w="it"/> is five <unk w="years"/> since Latvia acceded <unk w="to"/> the European <unk w="union"/> and to NATO .

Membership of <unk w="the"/> international organisations <unk w="constitute"/> a strategic aim for Latvia following <unk w="the"/> restoration of independence in 1991 .

Latvia <unk w="has"/> expressed its wish to participate in <unk w="democracy"/> and transatlantic <unk w="foreign"/> and security <unk w="policy"/> .

The <unk w="importance"/> of <unk w="the"/> family of European democratic nations in <unk w="the"/> first <unk w="part"/> of the 21st century represented the most <unk w="recent"/> changes in Europe since <unk w="the"/> foundation <unk w="of"/> the European Union .

European structures <unk w="have"/> joined <unk w="the"/> nations that <unk w="have"/> long been isolated by <unk w="women"/> from them , even though the <unk w="fact"/> that lie at <unk w="the"/> heart of the European Union <unk w=":"/> historically <unk w="and"/> rooted in these nations .

On 18 November <unk w="last"/> year , Latvia celebrated the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> anniversary of its <unk w="report"/> .

It once <unk w="again"/> affirmed <unk w="that"/> steadfast will to <unk w="be"/> in <unk w="an"/> independent , free and democratic nation .

<unk w="in"/> the <unk w="eldr"/> declaring the Republic of Latvia in <unk w="itself"/> it is written that : ' All citizens regardless <unk w="of"/> their <unk w="own"/> origin <unk w="is"/> called <unk w="upon"/> to give their assistance , for all human rights shall be guaranteed <unk w="and"/> Latvia .

It shall <unk w="be"/> a <unk w=","/> and just <unk w="one"/> , where <unk w="we"/> shall be <unk w="making"/> room for oppression and injustice ... ' .

Thirty years <unk w="after"/> the adoption of <unk w="the"/> Universal Declaration of Human Rights , <unk w="the"/> Republic of Latvia declared its loyalty to its fundamental values and principles .

Latvia has always felt itself to <unk w="go"/> to Europe and its values , <unk w="especially"/> when Latvia and other Central and <unk w="eastern"/> European nations were long <unk w="up"/> to a state <unk w="where"/> many values <unk w="being"/> looked <unk w="after"/> through a special <unk w="european"/> prism .

Peace <unk w="is"/> among the <unk w="members"/> of the <unk w="soviet"/> bloc , but it was the <unk w="result"/> of the prison courtyard .

<unk w="this"/> was brought about by the presence of <unk w="women"/> , repression and threats .

<unk w="this"/> year , ladies <unk w="and"/> gentlemen , both <unk w="parliament"/> and the whole <unk w="of"/> Europe were reminded <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="problem"/> of <unk w="their"/> ideology by Edvīns  nore 's film ' <unk w="success"/> <unk w="Soviet"/> Story ' .

We <unk w="have"/> a common <unk w="position"/> , <unk w="and"/> our fates have been <unk w="rejected"/> .

<unk w="we"/> have to look <unk w="carefully"/> into the past in order to understand one <unk w="voice"/> and look <unk w="to"/> the future <unk w="too"/> .

<unk w="that"/> is <unk w="why"/> I should like <unk w="to"/> thank the European <unk w="commission"/> for the declaration <unk w="declaration"/> on 22 September last <unk w="year"/> to <unk w="usd"/> 23 <unk w=","/> as the European Day of Remembrance <unk w="and"/> Victims of Stalinism <unk w="and"/> Nazism .

This declaration reminds the people of <unk w="one"/> of these <unk w="two"/> events in <unk w="the"/> history of <unk w="sport"/> and the whole of Europe .

<unk w="finally"/> , I should like to <unk w="look"/> at much more <unk w="to"/> history .

This <unk w="report"/> marks five years since Latvia <unk w="is"/> a member of the European <unk w="union"/> and of NATO .

What <unk w="is"/> our nation <unk w="'s"/> achievements <unk w=","/> and <unk w="there"/> are the challenges still <unk w="out"/> of us ?

Firstly , <unk w="this"/> aspiration to become part of <unk w="and"/> encouraged <unk w="the"/> consolidation <unk w="of"/> democracy in our <unk w="countries"/> and contributed to the development <unk w="of"/> democratic institutions .

<unk w="in"/> our <unk w="approach"/> to the European Union , Latvia <unk w="and"/> its determination <unk w="in"/> its <unk w="very"/> future , its determination to found its <unk w="neighbours"/> on a European identity and on our common values : freedom and democracy , accountability , the rule of law <unk w="and"/> human rights , <unk w="democracy"/> , <unk w="democracy"/> and prosperity .

<unk w="thirdly"/> , membership of the European Union has <unk w="caused"/> the investment climate in <unk w="colombia"/> .

' <unk w="dirty"/> money ' , as we <unk w="would"/> call European <unk w="of"/> structural funds , has contributed significantly <unk w="to"/> the development <unk w="of"/> Latvia <unk w="and"/> economy .

Thirdly , we <unk w="must"/> enjoy the privileges afforded by <unk w="the"/> free <unk w="movement"/> of persons .

Free <unk w="movement"/> in the Schengen area <unk w="has"/> become so customary and self-evident ; <unk w="it"/> has become so natural to learn , <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and <unk w="the"/> experience in <unk w="the"/> European Union <unk w="member"/> States .

<unk w="firstly"/> , the free movement of goods <unk w="and"/> services has <unk w="opened"/> up new opportunities for <unk w="peace"/> .

Every entrepreneur and consumer can operate <unk w="in"/> a <unk w="market"/> environment without borders <unk w="and"/> without customs duties .

For <unk w="example"/> in a <unk w="country"/> with a small internal market , this is particularly important .

Fifthly , <unk w="the"/> most important of <unk w="this"/> , <unk w="the"/> voices <unk w="are"/> heard in Europe <unk w=","/> European voices <unk w="have"/> heard in the <unk w="future"/> .

We can be proud that we have at our <unk w="disposal"/> such a <unk w="common"/> mechanism <unk w="in"/> collaboration .

It <unk w="is"/> all of us to search together <unk w="an"/> active <unk w="approach"/> to global challenges , climate <unk w="and"/> demographic <unk w="change"/> , <unk w="the"/> reinforcement of <unk w="social"/> security , the problems <unk w="of"/> migration , <unk w="especially"/> in <unk w="the"/> case of financial crisis , on a <unk w="european"/> scale .

<unk w="it"/> now has <unk w="at"/> its disposal new political and economic <unk w="development"/> , but it <unk w="must"/> be <unk w="clear"/> that our nation 's responsibility for the <unk w="foreseeable"/> future <unk w="of"/> Europe , a responsibility <unk w="for"/> all the people of Europe , <unk w="but"/> also significantly increased .

Looking <unk w="specifically"/> at <unk w="these"/> achievements , <unk w="we"/> must also be critical and <unk w="leading"/> up to <unk w="those"/> that <unk w="has"/> been <unk w="done"/> .

After accession <unk w="to"/> the European Union , the Latvian government lapsed into a sense of a ' job <unk w="'"/> done ' ; it had <unk w="been"/> its goal .

We <unk w="do"/> not <unk w="forget"/> that <unk w="we"/> were only <unk w="on"/> the <unk w="commission"/> and not <unk w="on"/> the <unk w="whole"/> of <unk w="the"/> process .

The <unk w="european"/> Union <unk w="offers"/> great opportunities , <unk w="with"/> each nation and each <unk w="country"/> must <unk w="address"/> them by itself .

<unk w="and"/> in Latvia have <unk w="been"/> grasped <unk w="to"/> the opportunities ; <unk w="they"/> have not always wisely implemented cohesion policy <unk w="and"/> made <unk w="out"/> of <unk w="the"/> financial <unk w="resources"/> we have been offered .

Our state institutions <unk w="ought"/> to learn <unk w="how"/> to live in the European <unk w="union"/> .

<unk w="i"/> have not been sufficiently determined to <unk w="make"/> the euro ; <unk w="it"/> is one <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="greatest"/> mistakes we have <unk w="made"/> in the euro integration process , something that is acutely evident today <unk w="in"/> the circumstances of <unk w="the"/> financial crisis .

Yet even the most hardened Eurosceptic <unk w="must"/> admit <unk w="that"/> Latvia <unk w="'s"/> membership of the <unk w="european"/> Union has on <unk w="the"/> whole been positive .

Is <unk w="there"/> anyone in Latvia who wants to return <unk w="to"/> a Europe where <unk w="there"/> are customs <unk w="and"/> between nations ?

Is there anyone who <unk w="wants"/> to wait in a queue at the <unk w="time"/> in <unk w="order"/> to enter a neighbouring country ?

Is there <unk w="anyone"/> who <unk w="have"/> to return <unk w="to"/> a <unk w="situation"/> where <unk w="there"/> are restrictions on the free <unk w="movement"/> of <unk w="services"/> , on their <unk w="side"/> and on their <unk w="own"/> experience ?

<unk w="the"/> Eurosceptics soon get used to good things , and become simply sceptics .

Ladies and <unk w="gentlemen"/> , the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of the <unk w="railway"/> within <unk w="the"/> financial system and <unk w=","/> in recent <unk w="years"/> has irreversibly changed <unk w="the"/> role and significance of national governments within economic processes .

<unk w="just"/> now , the financial markets <unk w="are"/> able to <unk w="intervene"/> very freely .

<unk w="we"/> were persuaded <unk w="that"/> the laws of <unk w="the"/> market would by themselves be sufficiently <unk w="involved"/> in <unk w="the"/> economic <unk w="situation"/> .

We believed that the market <unk w="forces"/> would put <unk w="pressure"/> in its place .

<unk w="as"/> we can see from this <unk w="economic"/> crisis , <unk w="however"/> , is that <unk w="the"/> financial systems and <unk w="the"/> economies <unk w="are"/> suffering from that market , and <unk w="most"/> important <unk w="for"/> all , real people <unk w="are"/> suffering from <unk w="the"/> crisis .

The course of events <unk w="at"/> the end of last year has shown us that <unk w="it"/> is essential for <unk w="the"/> governments <unk w="to"/> play a more <unk w="active"/> part <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="peace"/> process .

The previous approach , <unk w="to"/> nodding off at <unk w="the"/> wheel <unk w="of"/> economic management , was irresponsible .

Late enough <unk w="is"/> still <unk w="be"/> the obstacle - the financial morass - on the <unk w="years"/> ahead of us , but <unk w="no"/> longer able <unk w="to"/> avoid it .

In this <unk w="respect"/> , a <unk w="european"/> approach at national , European and global level is what <unk w="is"/> needed .

<unk w="in"/> the global <unk w="approach"/> , coordinated <unk w="pursuant"/> to <unk w="ensure"/> economic growth is essential .

That will only be <unk w="done"/> by designing a new architecture <unk w="and"/> mechanisms <unk w="for"/> the financial <unk w="perspective"/> .

It will <unk w="be"/> vital to supervise <unk w="the"/> system <unk w="and"/> , without simultaneously <unk w="any"/> initiative or <unk w="decision-making"/> processes .

The <unk w="most"/> difficult <unk w="thing"/> will <unk w="continue"/> to strike precisely this balance .

<unk w="at"/> the European level , <unk w="we"/> have a <unk w="good"/> advantage , for we can implement coordinated measures , take united action and achieve a sustainable solution .

<unk w="it"/> is <unk w="an"/> important <unk w="way"/> out of <unk w="the"/> morass <unk w="in"/> which we find ourselves at <unk w="the"/> time .

I shall spend a little more <unk w="emphasis"/> on <unk w="practical"/> solutions .

<unk w="it"/> is a school of thought which suggests <unk w="that"/> Latvia is <unk w="a"/> undergoing one of <unk w="the"/> most dramatic rescue <unk w="because"/> of <unk w="the"/> financial <unk w="interests"/> in modern European <unk w="union"/> .

Currently , Latvia is <unk w="based"/> on measures <unk w="to"/> stimulate the <unk w="economy"/> in order to <unk w="improve"/> the financial and economic situation swiftly and <unk w="efficiently"/> .

It is a difficult task , but <unk w="we"/> shall succeed in overcoming the crisis only <unk w="by"/> seeing a <unk w="long"/> way <unk w="out"/> of it , and <unk w="not"/> by <unk w="the"/> short-term <unk w="measures"/> for a <unk w="strategic"/> vision <unk w="of"/> economic development .

At the end of <unk w="the"/> year , six <unk w="interested"/> parties represented <unk w="by"/> the <unk w="european"/> parliament , from both <unk w="parties"/> and opposition , agreed <unk w="on"/> a common stance of support for the <unk w="foreseeable"/> stabilisation <unk w="process"/> drawn <unk w="up"/> by the Latvian government .

<unk w="the"/> agreement <unk w="provides"/> for special <unk w="measures"/> to be <unk w="open"/> to monitoring how <unk w="a"/> loan <unk w="and"/> to Latvia is <unk w="concerned"/> .

The <unk w="commission"/> defines the <unk w="traditional"/> priorities for <unk w="europe"/> 's <unk w="union"/> : <unk w="exemptions"/> for exports , the promotion of free and fair <unk w="competition"/> , a significant reduction in <unk w="the"/> current-account <unk w=","/> in the balance of payments , and the introduction of <unk w="the"/> euro in 2012 .

Accession <unk w="to"/> the euro area <unk w="will"/> become one of <unk w="the"/> nation 's most important <unk w="political"/> goals .

It is <unk w="important"/> for <unk w="people"/> not to be left <unk w="behind"/> in this <unk w="chamber"/> .

We <unk w="are"/> being helped to overcome this <unk w="sad"/> time not only by international <unk w="fishing"/> organisations but also by the institutions <unk w="of"/> the European <unk w="union"/> and by <unk w="the"/> nations of <unk w="europe"/> .

Ladies and <unk w="gentlemen"/> , each <unk w="country"/> has <unk w="not"/> only <unk w="in"/> the European <unk w="union"/> new Member <unk w="states"/> , <unk w="but"/> it <unk w="was"/> also introduced <unk w="to"/> accents into <unk w="the"/> agenda , including its foreign <unk w="ministry"/> .

Latvia <unk w="'s"/> accession to the European Union took <unk w="place"/> at a time <unk w="for"/> Europe 's Neighbourhood <unk w="accounted"/> , its goals , principles and <unk w="control"/> mechanisms , <unk w="are"/> being drawn up .

Since that <unk w="time"/> , there has <unk w="been"/> a particular <unk w="problem"/> in <unk w="the"/> European Union <unk w="'s"/> foreign policy <unk w="principally"/> towards its eastern neighbours .

This has happened <unk w="thanks"/> to the engagement <unk w="and"/> experience of the new <unk w="member"/> States .

Latvia has always seen neighbourhood relations <unk w="with"/> a wider <unk w="market"/> .

Latvia will <unk w="continue"/> to <unk w="play"/> an active part in the determination <unk w="and"/> implementation <unk w="of"/> this <unk w="directive"/> in the <unk w="future"/> .

<unk w="this"/> policy is not just a matter of the European Union 's relations <unk w="with"/> particular <unk w="countries"/> , that is , with <unk w="member"/> states with <unk w="which"/> it shares a land or maritime border .

In the <unk w="light"/> of this <unk w="directive"/> , we must address the European Union <unk w="to"/> place <unk w="the"/> role <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="eu"/> .

<unk w="together"/> with other like-minded nations , Latvia has actively <unk w="created"/> a <unk w="direct"/> involvement by <unk w="the"/> European Union in <unk w="the"/> eastern neighbourhood region .

A <unk w="new"/> political <unk w="solution"/> , the ' Eastern Partnership ' has come about , <unk w="the"/> mission is to reshape Europe <unk w="a"/> common <unk w="agricultural"/> policy and <unk w="that"/> it <unk w="is"/> the <unk w="specific"/> characteristics of this region , thereby making this process more <unk w="effective"/> , more courageous and more ambitious .

Latvia notes with pleasure <unk w="at"/> European Commission 's proposals in this <unk w="area"/> .

In its <unk w="legislative"/> work , the <unk w="accession"/> Partnership must strengthen the political and <unk w="economic"/> relations <unk w="between"/> the European Union and the states in this region , and also <unk w="for"/> the mutual cooperation between those states .

In developing the <unk w="accession"/> Partnership , <unk w="attention"/> must <unk w="be"/> paid to the differentiation principle , <unk w="the"/> assessment <unk w="of"/> the attitude towards each of the partners .

<unk w="some"/> of <unk w="member"/> states <unk w="are"/> following its own path of development .

There are those states who wish <unk w="to"/> see themselves <unk w="in"/> the European <unk w="union"/> , <unk w="but"/> there are those states that have <unk w="two"/> other goals for themselves .

Our <unk w="approach"/> will <unk w="be"/> only if we are able to <unk w="work"/> together with <unk w="all"/> the <unk w="peoples"/> of this region , <unk w="and"/> with understanding where necessary .

I also <unk w="received"/> positive signals for <unk w="development"/> and <unk w="constructive"/> cooperation on my visit to <unk w="the"/> Central <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> nations <unk w="in"/> October , when I <unk w="saw"/> Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan .

Latvia will continue <unk w="to"/> be an active supporter <unk w="of"/> Europe 's Neighbourhood Policy and play an active <unk w="part"/> in <unk w="achieving"/> it .

Every European nation has its own <unk w="tradition"/> of history and its own opportunities to work <unk w="in"/> our <unk w="european"/> project <unk w="for"/> the benefit of the <unk w="european"/> Union .

Latvia 's particular <unk w="reference"/> to <unk w="the"/> eastern dimension is the mutual trust <unk w="offered"/> by our <unk w="economic"/> relations , which are rooted in a <unk w="long"/> period <unk w="of"/> history , <unk w="because"/> the expertise born out <unk w="of"/> that trust .

Latvia 's duty is <unk w="to"/> make <unk w="use"/> of this special circumstance <unk w="that"/> could be lost <unk w="over"/> the next 10 <unk w="years"/> .

After several decades , <unk w="in"/> eastern eyes , Latvia will <unk w="be"/> only one of the Member <unk w="states"/> of <unk w="the"/> European Union , not the gateway to Europe .

<unk w="the"/> use of these <unk w="weapons"/> , Latvia will maintain an active <unk w="political"/> dialogue <unk w="in"/> order to encourage a better <unk w="overview"/> of the <unk w="european"/> Union and its <unk w="leaders"/> in the neighbouring states <unk w=","/> so <unk w="that"/> the <unk w="whole"/> of the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Eastern <unk w="mediterranean"/> .

That is of mutual <unk w="interest"/> , and <unk w="we"/> have an opportunity to <unk w="know"/> how neighbouring states perceive their future relations with <unk w="the"/> European Union .

I am convinced that <unk w="parliament"/> 's interests <unk w="must"/> be <unk w="simply"/> served by <unk w="the"/> early <unk w="out"/> of the Eastern Partnership <unk w="with"/> the Czech Republic 's Presidency .

Ladies and gentlemen , the <unk w="field"/> of energy security has <unk w="also"/> recently become <unk w="involved"/> during the first days of the Czech Presidency .

The financial and <unk w="economic"/> crisis is <unk w="not"/> in its own way .

Questions associated with energy security and sustainable energy sources are , however , always <unk w="in"/> Europe <unk w="'s"/> political agenda and that of the world .

This means that <unk w="the"/> question <unk w="should"/> be <unk w="the"/> divorced from the world situation .

The <unk w="tragic"/> events <unk w="in"/> Ukraine and the conflict in <unk w="we"/> are proof of this .

Even quite recently , European Union Member <unk w="states"/> regarded <unk w="itself"/> as an issue to <unk w="be"/> resolved at the <unk w="moment"/> and <unk w="we"/> at <unk w="the"/> European Union <unk w="level"/> .

The events <unk w="in"/> the last year in the energy sector , the interruptions <unk w="of"/> energy supply , <unk w="the"/> shrinking of energy resources and <unk w="whose"/> volatility have helped to create a common understanding <unk w="of"/> European <unk w="union"/> Member States of <unk w="the"/> need <unk w="for"/> a common energy policy .

At the intersection of energy and politics , our main task is <unk w="to"/> secure a regular , sufficient , economic , <unk w="efficient"/> and environmentally friendly <unk w="food"/> supply .

<unk w="i"/> have to admit <unk w="that"/> the European <unk w="union"/> has <unk w="not"/> only <unk w="a"/> success in this sphere .

<unk w="on"/> some issues , of which the development of an environmentally friendly energy economy is an <unk w="important"/> , <unk w="we"/> have adopted ambitious goals <unk w="at"/> the <unk w="european"/> level , which we <unk w="must"/> now begin to achieve .

On <unk w="these"/> issues - diversification of energy sources at <unk w="european"/> level and creation of a single energy market - we are <unk w="looking"/> at the <unk w="heart"/> of our <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .

The <unk w="events"/> of <unk w="the"/> last few days , involving a <unk w="series"/> of gas <unk w="emissions"/> from <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> , <unk w="the"/> opened eyes <unk w="to"/> the need to <unk w="make"/> the <unk w="best"/> possible <unk w="competition"/> at pan-European level .

<unk w="all"/> of us have the <unk w="opportunity"/> of <unk w="doing"/> this common understanding to create a truly integrated and <unk w="integrated"/> European energy <unk w="policy"/> .

<unk w="we"/> must <unk w="not"/> allow our resolve to vanish along <unk w="with"/> this <unk w="year"/> 's snow .

The energy <unk w="in"/> question can only <unk w="be"/> successfully resolved by <unk w="an"/> active dialogue with the transit <unk w="of"/> supplier <unk w="and"/> for energy resources .

<unk w="the"/> European Union has <unk w="the"/> foreign <unk w="policy"/> instruments to resolve this issue .

A <unk w="new"/> direction where we <unk w="can"/> make serious efforts <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="use"/> of <unk w="the"/> Baltic energy market with the Scandinavian and <unk w="the"/> European energy <unk w="sector"/> .

Its initiative <unk w="will"/> improve energy <unk w="efficiency"/> and solidarity also includes the <unk w="competitiveness"/> of the interconnection <unk w=","/> for <unk w="the"/> Baltic <unk w="sea"/> market .

This will <unk w="provide"/> for a progressive <unk w="reform"/> of the Baltic States into the single <unk w="european"/> energy market .

I hold Sweden 's involvement in the strategic <unk w="debate"/> on <unk w="the"/> Baltic Sea <unk w="and"/> in <unk w="this"/> regard .

Sweden will shortly <unk w="have"/> the opportunity <unk w="to"/> put it into practice during its presidency <unk w="and"/> the second <unk w="generation"/> of this <unk w="directive"/> .

I <unk w="am"/> convinced that strong <unk w="proposals"/> from <unk w="the"/> Mediterranean to the <unk w="irish"/> Sea make <unk w="such"/> a <unk w="large"/> European Union .

Ladies and <unk w="gentlemen"/> , <unk w="the"/> initial aim of the <unk w="european"/> Union - the security and <unk w="defence"/> of <unk w="the"/> people of Europe - has not altered .

What has altered is the <unk w="way"/> in which we must <unk w="achieve"/> this aim .

The <unk w="irish"/> economy is much more closely linked than it was <unk w="just"/> a century ago .

At the same <unk w="time"/> , powerful <unk w="and"/> economic players have appeared on <unk w="the"/> world scene .

It is only <unk w="a"/> coherent , far-sighted and , <unk w="as"/> important of all , <unk w="the"/> action <unk w="by"/> the European Union <unk w=","/> we can <unk w="certainly"/> not <unk w="only"/> be the losers in this global <unk w="market"/> struggle .

<unk w="only"/> together can we <unk w="see"/> the promises of <unk w="peace"/> and wellbeing for <unk w="our"/> citizens .

<unk w="and"/> thus <unk w="can"/> we attain <unk w="the"/> goal for which the people of <unk w="the"/> nations have cast <unk w="their"/> votes , in support of our <unk w="colleagues"/> in the <unk w="european"/> Union .

The European Parliament has already shown that it has a <unk w="political"/> vision of the <unk w="future"/> of the European Union .

This is especially true of its <unk w="constructive"/> and balanced approach to the <unk w="eu"/> 's enlargement policy .

Europe 's dynamic growth has <unk w="a"/> Europe <unk w="the"/> opportunity to compete globally .

This growth is Europe 's potential , which it <unk w="can"/> exploit , so that the Union can , <unk w="for"/> several decades from now , <unk w="be"/> an equal <unk w="trading"/> partner for the <unk w="fastest"/> growing Asian and Latin American <unk w="countries"/> .

It <unk w="told"/> you yourselves in particular , as <unk w="the"/> democratically elected representatives <unk w="of"/> Europe 's nations , who <unk w="have"/> the responsibility <unk w="of"/> this process most acutely .

<unk w="it"/> is also impossible <unk w="to"/> overestimate the significance <unk w="of"/> the European Parliament in <unk w="supporting"/> the <unk w="european"/> project nearer <unk w="to"/> our people and extending its democratic legitimacy .

<unk w="in"/> the <unk w="commission"/> , <unk w="the"/> role of the European <unk w="union"/> will become even <unk w="more"/> important .

<unk w="it"/> is important to <unk w="be"/> in <unk w="the"/> multiformity <unk w="biological"/> diversity .

It is important <unk w="to"/> continue working <unk w="on"/> improving the European <unk w="union"/> .

<unk w="it"/> is a <unk w="feeling"/> that all <unk w="we"/> must take on together .

It is essential <unk w="to"/> prevent fragmentation of the European Union .

Member States must seek solutions and <unk w="promote"/> the development of a multi-speed approach to the European project .

<unk w="the"/> agreement reached in the Council last <unk w="year"/> for the furtherance of the Lisbon Treaty is <unk w="successful"/> .

The <unk w="maastricht"/> Treaty is the legal <unk w="basis"/> for the <unk w="commission"/> fully effective <unk w="implementation"/> of the European Union .

<unk w="but"/> by putting the principles of <unk w="the"/> Lisbon Treaty <unk w="into"/> practice <unk w="will"/> we be able fully to <unk w="support"/> the <unk w="full"/> potential <unk w="of"/> the new , united Europe offers .

<unk w="how"/> effectively <unk w="the"/> Lisbon Treaty will <unk w=","/> in practice depends on the political will <unk w="of"/> the Member States <unk w="'"/> institutions and their ability to unite in achieving <unk w="europe"/> 's goals .

Ladies <unk w="and"/> gentlemen , until 2004 , Latvia 's goal was <unk w="one"/> of the European <unk w="union"/> .

Since that time , we have shaped Latvia <unk w="and"/> goals <unk w="in"/> the context of Europe 's goals .

We can no longer consider and perceive <unk w="it"/> separately from <unk w="it"/> .

<unk w="we"/> can define and <unk w="draw"/> Latvia 's goals only if <unk w="we"/> match Europe 's common vision of the future .

For their part , Europe <unk w="'s"/> goals <unk w="and"/> attainable <unk w=","/> they <unk w="need"/> to <unk w="the"/> vision <unk w="of"/> every <unk w="member"/> State .

<unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> was <unk w="founded"/> and <unk w="to"/> be <unk w="focused"/> on a base <unk w="for"/> common values .

Only public discussion can <unk w="help"/> out <unk w="the"/> values that are common to all <unk w="of"/> us .

Only <unk w="in"/> unison <unk w=","/> we agree on those <unk w="things"/> that we <unk w="are"/> going <unk w="to"/> place alongside <unk w="them"/> on which <unk w="the"/> European Union was founded .

It <unk w="is"/> the <unk w="end"/> of all <unk w="this"/> , but especially of Europe 's leaders , to define European <unk w="standards"/> and <unk w="a"/> discussion on them .

How <unk w="can"/> I see the <unk w="european"/> Union and Latvia in the longer term ?

The post-crisis economic world will have <unk w="come"/> into several <unk w="national"/> power centres .

Europe will <unk w="support"/> the <unk w="best"/> and the ability to be united , for <unk w="the"/> union will <unk w="give"/> us the chance <unk w="to"/> fulfil <unk w="its"/> tasks .

Moreover , <unk w="the"/> European Union will still <unk w="be"/> open to all <unk w="the"/> Europeans <unk w="to"/> accept its values .

<unk w="european"/> unity in diversity will <unk w="be"/> the key to <unk w="the"/> growing importance of Europe 's role in <unk w="the"/> world .

The European <unk w="union"/> will have expanded , but it <unk w="does"/> not lose the <unk w="result"/> of effective action .

The European Union <unk w="must"/> be able to look after its own security <unk w="and"/> provide for stability <unk w="with"/> its neighbours .

Education and culture will be the bridge <unk w="between"/> the different <unk w="classes"/> of the European <unk w="union"/> 's Member States and that will help <unk w="to"/> regain Europe 's leading role in the world in the realms of science <unk w="and"/> culture .

There will no longer be <unk w="clarity"/> and new , small and large European nations .

In Europe , nations will be <unk w="defined"/> according to <unk w="its"/> achievements , not <unk w="the"/> geographical <unk w="and"/> geopolitical criteria .

Europe will be united , <unk w="and"/> this unity will be secured by powerful <unk w="means"/> , which while defending their own <unk w="interests"/> will <unk w="work"/> closely together with others , thereby creating a network of wellbeing <unk w="and"/> development throughout Europe .

Every nation <unk w="can"/> contribute to <unk w="sustainable"/> development according to its own abilities <unk w="in"/> particular knowledge .

What will <unk w="happen"/> Latvia <unk w="'s"/> role in the <unk w="european"/> Union of <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> ?

That will be a time when Latvia <unk w="will"/> have <unk w="benefited"/> from the <unk w="commission"/> .

Latvia 's <unk w="own"/> city , <unk w="however"/> , will be one of the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> centres <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="european"/> economic <unk w="situation"/> .

Latvia 's <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> will be more balanced , <unk w="more"/> competitive and <unk w="more"/> transformed .

In 2015 , <unk w="in"/> the first <unk w="instance"/> in <unk w="the"/> history <unk w="of"/> the independent <unk w="media"/> , <unk w="who"/> will be entrusted <unk w="to"/> solving questions on the European and global scale as the presiding Member State of the European Union .

<unk w="the"/> contribution <unk w="in"/> Europe will be our <unk w="political"/> relationships <unk w="with"/> the Eastern Partnership <unk w="agreement"/> .

<unk w="ladies"/> and <unk w="the"/> region will be the bridge <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="union"/> , <unk w="such"/> as the Mediterranean states will join <unk w="the"/> shores of that sea .

Our <unk w="view"/> of <unk w="the"/> open <unk w="coordination"/> and our experience of <unk w="what"/> will be the <unk w="key"/> to Europe <unk w="'s"/> openness .

<unk w="ladies"/> and gentlemen , 2015 is not far away ; <unk w="and"/> six years stand between <unk w="them"/> .

A century <unk w="ago"/> , the Latvian poet <unk w="was"/> wrote : ' What changes , endures ' .

It <unk w="will"/> grow <unk w="more"/> powerful in its <unk w="beautiful"/> , <unk w="terrorism"/> and mutual <unk w="respect"/> .

Europeans will be proud that <unk w="we"/> live in <unk w="europe"/> and yet belong to their <unk w="own"/> nation .

Unity in diversity , <unk w="however"/> , preservation of values <unk w=","/> every citizen 's <unk w="business"/> towards <unk w="his"/> or her nation <unk w=","/> for the European family <unk w="as"/> a <unk w="whole"/> , <unk w="it"/> is <unk w="europe"/> 's future .

<unk w="ladies"/> and gentlemen , Europe <unk w="'s"/> development <unk w="and"/> prosperity is <unk w="the"/> yardstick <unk w="of"/> our success .

I <unk w="call"/> on <unk w="this"/> , as <unk w="members"/> of the European Parliament , <unk w="to"/> encourage <unk w="citizens"/> ' understanding <unk w="of"/> our common <unk w="strategy"/> and of how <unk w="it"/> will affect <unk w="the"/> life of every European in his or <unk w="her"/> own home .

The <unk w="safety"/> of <unk w="european"/> citizens for the idea of Europe <unk w="in"/> the strongest <unk w="round"/> of Europe <unk w="'s"/> future .

I <unk w="urge"/> you , <unk w="ladies"/> and gentlemen , for your <unk w="answer"/> in this session .

I <unk w="wish"/> you success in <unk w="the"/> further work and in the next European Parliament <unk w="tomorrow"/> .

<unk w="mr"/> President , <unk w="can"/> I thank you on behalf of the European <unk w="parliament"/> for your <unk w="support"/> , for <unk w="the"/> European courageousness and for your European determination .

We <unk w="are"/> of course glad to hear that you <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="european"/> Parliament , and rightly <unk w="so"/> .

I still remember very clearly that , during accession <unk w=","/> in <unk w="the"/> second half <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="schengen"/> , Latvia , Lithuania and <unk w="austria"/> were initially <unk w="rejected"/> .

It was <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="parliament"/> that called on the governments to include Latvia , Lithuania and <unk w="gentlemen"/> in the negotiations .

As a result , Latvia , <unk w="lithuania"/> and Slovakia were able to become <unk w="one"/> of the <unk w="soviet"/> Union on 1 May 2004 .

You addressed the <unk w="first"/> question and I shall <unk w="try"/> to <unk w="be"/> very <unk w="carefully"/> .

We have a very responsible Commissioner , a <unk w="declaration"/> of yours , <unk w="mr"/> Piebalgs , who <unk w="committed"/> himself <unk w="as"/> last week and during <unk w="the"/> gas dispute with Russia and Ukraine , but especially with <unk w="guinea"/> .

I <unk w="would"/> like to thank Andris Piebalgs for his work in the presence of <unk w="the"/> President .

Mr President , my <unk w="own"/> remark is <unk w="this"/> : you <unk w="are"/> about how <unk w="things"/> are learning and Latvia is learning .

Yet even those <unk w="who"/> belonged <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="european"/> Community , to <unk w="the"/> European Union , <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="farmers"/> are learning from you and <unk w="great"/> historical experiences .

If we are <unk w="prepared"/> to listen to <unk w="the"/> other <unk w="things"/> to learn from each <unk w="other"/> , then we shall <unk w="then"/> be <unk w="much"/> better <unk w="with"/> it .

<unk w="on"/> the basis of our common values , we are strong , <unk w="transparent"/> and free .

Thank <unk w="you"/> , President Zatlers , it <unk w="is"/> a <unk w="position"/> to <unk w="inform"/> you here today .

( <unk w="es"/> ) Madam <unk w="president"/> , I welcome the <unk w="report"/> , which <unk w="would"/> force <unk w="some"/> of <unk w="developing"/> countries <unk w="to"/> create a timetable and draw up action plans to <unk w="prevent"/> risks from <unk w="the"/> use of <unk w="resources"/> .

<unk w="the"/> restrictions on spraying <unk w="and"/> aircraft will surely be welcomed <unk w="for"/> EU citizens , as will <unk w="the"/> buffer zones for protecting drinking water <unk w="and"/> aquatic organisms .

I voted for <unk w="this"/> directive <unk w="and"/> it is in line with <unk w="the"/> views <unk w="on"/> health <unk w="problems"/> .

Madam President , I <unk w="am"/> in favour of <unk w="this"/> compromise because it makes sense that we <unk w="make"/> sustainable use of pesticides .

I think the real problem <unk w="is"/> that <unk w="there"/> are <unk w="the"/> different rules across <unk w="member"/> States : some <unk w="must"/> apply training and education <unk w=","/> operators <unk w="in"/> a very strict way and , <unk w="therefore"/> , have good sustainable use of pesticides , but <unk w="that"/> all countries do <unk w="not"/> .

I think this <unk w="sort"/> of legislation will make it appropriate <unk w="if"/> we <unk w="have"/> higher <unk w="education"/> across the <unk w="european"/> Union .

That is good both for those who operate sprays and for those who come into <unk w="contact"/> with them .

I think we are talking <unk w="about"/> a very sensible package here , so I was <unk w="very"/> happy to support <unk w="it"/> , and I <unk w="congratulate"/> the <unk w="commission"/> .

There is no question <unk w="that"/> we <unk w="create"/> a regulatory system for <unk w="consumers"/> .

<unk w="the"/> Klaß report extends the <unk w="number"/> of controls <unk w="and"/> limits <unk w="and"/> use <unk w="of"/> PPPs <unk w="for"/> essential use .

Interestingly , <unk w="since"/> there was a very vexed debate on hazard-versus-risk on the Breyer report , I have always felt <unk w="that"/> this <unk w="debate"/> is more <unk w="sensitive"/> to the actual <unk w="fact"/> as distinct <unk w=","/> placing <unk w="on"/> the market - in other words , this report .

A <unk w="wide"/> range of <unk w="agricultural"/> products can be hazardous if <unk w="the"/> handling <unk w="of"/> usage instructions <unk w="are"/> ignored .

Being <unk w="on"/> the market in <unk w="education"/> is not a risk to <unk w="the"/> consumer , the environment or <unk w="the"/> user of <unk w="agricultural"/> products .

Pesticides <unk w="can"/> only <unk w="even"/> if the <unk w="commission"/> does <unk w="not"/> know <unk w="whether"/> he or she is doing , if the application equipment <unk w="is"/> faulty , if <unk w="the"/> aquatic environment <unk w="is"/> ignored <unk w="and"/> if <unk w="they"/> are <unk w="being"/> stored and not part of <unk w="an"/> integrated pest-management <unk w="management"/> .

<unk w="this"/> concept <unk w="of"/> quantitative use reduction needs careful management , as <unk w="a"/> frequent spraying <unk w="the"/> higher concentration of pesticide could result .

<unk w="at"/> the end <unk w="of"/> the day , these substances must be <unk w="brought"/> to the <unk w="same"/> extent <unk w="and"/> , as every farmer knows .

( CS ) Madam President , I would <unk w="like"/> to respond again to yesterday <unk w="'s"/> plenary <unk w="part-session"/> .

I <unk w="welcome"/> the new regulation <unk w=","/> in my <unk w="view"/> it <unk w="is"/> a tool <unk w="for"/> pursuing new and <unk w="effective"/> alternatives for protecting <unk w="consumers"/> .

I <unk w="deplore"/> the mutual recognition <unk w="and"/> approved pesticides according to <unk w="which"/> zones to be a positive <unk w="response"/> for our Parliament .

<unk w="the"/> preparation of a list <unk w="of"/> banned substances is also a step forward - these include carcinogens , genotoxic substances <unk w="and"/> also substances with neurotoxic and immunotoxic effects - and is based <unk w="on"/> scientific knowledge .

As the Commissioner said yesterday , it seems that <unk w="it"/> applies to a relatively small percentage of the substances still <unk w="exists"/> today .

I would like <unk w="to"/> mention that <unk w="we"/> must apply these requirements strictly <unk w="as"/> imported goods as well .

Commissioner , I also wanted <unk w="to"/> have a say <unk w="to"/> other <unk w="words"/> but I <unk w="am"/> not given the floor .

These reports have already been <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> for explanatory purposes or they <unk w="have"/> already <unk w="been"/> debated here , so I believe they will be <unk w="involved"/> in <unk w="its"/> written form .

Since I <unk w="am"/> a <unk w="situation"/> there has been one vegetable <unk w="or"/> I hate : peas .

But I <unk w="have"/> the <unk w="extent"/> to represent <unk w="turkey"/> 's largest growing <unk w="free-trade"/> area , which <unk w="is"/> given <unk w="us"/> a huge problem with the Breyer report .

I agree with <unk w="the"/> aims of <unk w="community"/> legislation to promote the health of our environment , <unk w="public"/> health <unk w="of"/> us <unk w="all"/> individuals , but it really <unk w="also"/> threatens a huge agricultural industry in my region .

<unk w="so"/> much soul-searching , I have abstained , but I <unk w="want"/> to <unk w="make"/> it clear that I <unk w="reaffirm"/> our legislative <unk w="proposals"/> in this respect <unk w="is"/> flawed .

We had so much information at the end - conflicting and otherwise - that I , and I <unk w="have"/> many others , would have welcomed the possibility of a third reading , or <unk w="the"/> conciliation , to make sure that we have protected <unk w="their"/> interests .

<unk w="mr"/> President , I <unk w="have"/> found this a <unk w="very"/> difficult decision .

I felt that <unk w="this"/> report was , in <unk w="fact"/> , very well-balanced <unk w="and"/> constructive , <unk w="and"/> it was <unk w="not"/> designed to <unk w="guarantee"/> a high level of protection for <unk w="public"/> health , animal <unk w="welfare"/> and <unk w="the"/> environment .

However , I have <unk w="talked"/> about <unk w="the"/> situation <unk w="that"/> we <unk w="are"/> making <unk w="provision"/> for approval of a particular substance based on whether that substance is a hazard <unk w="or"/> not , <unk w="but"/> we are <unk w="not"/> taking possible exposure into account .

I think we need impact <unk w="assessments"/> conducted on a scientific <unk w="basis"/> .

<unk w="one"/> of my concerns is that , <unk w="when"/> I talk <unk w="about"/> citizens about the EU , <unk w="one"/> of the <unk w="eu"/> they constantly raise with <unk w="it"/> is that , at times , the EU 's legislation is not always proportionate .

<unk w="but"/> I believe there <unk w="is"/> flexibility in this report , I <unk w="think"/> we needed a <unk w="little"/> more , <unk w="more"/> crucially we needed <unk w="for"/> scientific <unk w="advice"/> to support the <unk w="report"/> .

Yes , <unk w="this"/> is the <unk w="precautionary"/> principle , and we <unk w="need"/> to <unk w="be"/> mindful of this , but <unk w="it"/> also <unk w="need"/> to be evidence-based , and I would have liked a little more <unk w="interest"/> in <unk w="this"/> matter .

<unk w="mr"/> President , the efficient and effective <unk w="use"/> of pesticides is a necessity .

<unk w="in"/> the <unk w="protection"/> of the environment and <unk w="that"/> of public health go hand-in-hand , I believe we have <unk w="a"/> balance <unk w="and"/> needs of consumers <unk w="and"/> producers .

Whilst I welcome the aims of the <unk w="annual"/> report to reduce red tape , I am not able <unk w="to"/> support <unk w="it"/> .

I have <unk w="dealt"/> with a <unk w="number"/> of experts <unk w="to"/> farmers and <unk w="their"/> representatives in my <unk w="own"/> Midlands constituency who all have deep <unk w="concern"/> about <unk w="the"/> effects that this report will have on crop <unk w="consumption"/> .

My biggest worry is that there has not been a proper impact assessment <unk w="by"/> the Commission <unk w=","/> there is no clear indication of <unk w="what"/> this report <unk w="would"/> mean for agriculture .

At a time of rising food prices <unk w="in"/> the world , I <unk w="do"/> not think that now <unk w="is"/> the <unk w="need"/> for us to have a knee-jerk <unk w="approach"/> to <unk w="the"/> measures which may have adverse effects on food production .

That is why my <unk w="group"/> introduced an amendment for a thorough and long <unk w="environmental"/> impact assessment .

<unk w="mr"/> President , <unk w="like"/> other colleagues , I should like to <unk w="say"/> that this was a very difficult dossier .

While Diana Wallis <unk w="is"/> concerned about peas , you <unk w="can"/> imagine that , in Ireland , <unk w="we"/> were <unk w="not"/> on our menu <unk w="and"/> on the <unk w="ground"/> .

Overall , <unk w="however"/> , I believe that what we <unk w="agree"/> on is a much <unk w="better"/> proposal and <unk w="more"/> than <unk w="the"/> original one on the table - and I <unk w="congratulate"/> those who <unk w="voted"/> on it .

<unk w="let"/> me say a few things about this - and I will end <unk w="up"/> with the <unk w="starting"/> point .

I think we are now in a position <unk w="on"/> farmers need to <unk w="give"/> the agrochemical industry to produce safer alternatives so that they can continue to produce food , and I think as much energy <unk w="can"/> go <unk w="through"/> that <unk w=","/> as has <unk w="been"/> heretofore .

<unk w="when"/> it comes <unk w="to"/> food imports , the <unk w="elderly"/> need to address <unk w="the"/> genuine concerns of <unk w="young"/> farmers and <unk w="ensure"/> that they will be <unk w="suffering"/> from <unk w="a"/> certain <unk w="countries"/> but third <unk w="countries"/> continue to <unk w="join"/> them .

We need <unk w="an"/> explanation of that <unk w="in"/> order <unk w="to"/> bring farmers with us .

Madam President , I voted <unk w="for"/> this <unk w="report"/> because the proposal has been hijacked in <unk w="writing"/> by the Committee <unk w="on"/> the Environment , Public Health and <unk w="consumer"/> Safety and Commissioners .

The rapporteurs yesterday boasted <unk w="the"/> standardisation , <unk w="and"/> yet this is allegedly a Union <unk w="of"/> diversity .

If there were <unk w="an"/> area <unk w="of"/> judgement , <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and <unk w="they"/> are needed , it is <unk w="worth"/> this .

This was <unk w="not"/> an agricultural <unk w="sector"/> , but the Danish Commissioner for agriculture was nowhere <unk w="to"/> be <unk w="done"/> at <unk w="the"/> time , <unk w="and"/> that <unk w="is"/> a disgrace .

<unk w="the"/> reason , of <unk w="course"/> , is because of a conflict of <unk w="conflict"/> since the <unk w="latter"/> fail <unk w="to"/> process their drinking water after it comes out of <unk w="the"/> ground .

<unk w="but"/> in my part of the world feel totally let down and frankly insulted by the fact that <unk w="there"/> are some <unk w="people"/> here that they do not know what they are <unk w="doing"/> , and <unk w="we"/> need to be told .

Essentially you have <unk w="not"/> yet <unk w="another"/> group to those in <unk w="the"/> UK who <unk w="have"/> loathe the European Union 's interference .

Madam <unk w="president"/> , exaggerated <unk w="comments"/> have <unk w="been"/> made and <unk w="concerns"/> expressed by all sides <unk w="of"/> this report .

It is has <unk w="been"/> difficult to <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> fact from <unk w="this"/> and <unk w="now"/> come to a decision <unk w="on"/> how to vote .

<unk w="so"/> I recognise the concerns <unk w="of"/> the soft fruit <unk w="industry"/> , <unk w="the"/> potato industry <unk w=","/> the cereal <unk w="sector"/> in Ireland <unk w="who"/> have spoken to me about this , I supported the <unk w="report"/> .

I feel the improvements made were worth our support , even though I <unk w="would"/> have some concerns .

I supported the vote <unk w="which"/> , in my opinion , the worst of <unk w="positive"/> outcomes would be to deliver this <unk w="right"/> to <unk w="us"/> .

The five-year derogation , <unk w="even"/> if <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> for essential plant <unk w="research"/> projects , <unk w="is"/> an important safety net <unk w="but"/> also encourages the agrochemical industry to research <unk w="and"/> produce alternatives .

Madam President , I think <unk w="that"/> , when one considers <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> , there is a dialectic <unk w="at"/> its heart .

We talk about <unk w="this"/> , yet <unk w="we"/> ignore <unk w="the"/> democratic will as expressed in referenda <unk w="in"/> France , <unk w="the"/> Netherlands and Ireland .

We <unk w="talk"/> about <unk w="social"/> security , <unk w="then"/> we vote on a report which has <unk w="the"/> potential to undermine food <unk w="safety"/> in the <unk w="european"/> Union .

We <unk w="talk"/> about helping <unk w="citizens"/> and farmers in <unk w="third"/> countries , <unk w="and"/> there will now <unk w="be"/> , as a result of this vote , a call to ban <unk w="them"/> from farmers who have used <unk w="products"/> that are now <unk w="living"/> in <unk w="the"/> European Union .

I simply have a plea to my colleagues <unk w="in"/> Parliament and <unk w="to"/> the Commission : Please , <unk w="let"/> us think <unk w="in"/> future about the unintended <unk w="viability"/> of our legislation .

I agree <unk w="with"/> Mrs <unk w="lucas"/> about the legislative <unk w="procedure"/> and that <unk w="we"/> should have <unk w="been"/> a third reading .

I agree it has been rushed through and I think we <unk w="all"/> agree that there has <unk w="been"/> an <unk w="enormous"/> impact <unk w="assessment"/> on a scientific <unk w="basis"/> .

Madam President , I tried to undermine the <unk w="report"/> by voting <unk w="in"/> those parts of this report .

I <unk w="cannot"/> explain why <unk w="in"/> reading <unk w="in"/> a letter to <unk w="me"/> from <unk w="the"/> Mowbray , <unk w="which"/> is a <unk w="very"/> near <unk w="situation"/> in <unk w="the"/> region .

He said , ' I have personally <unk w="been"/> involved in <unk w="the"/> application of <unk w="community"/> protection products for <unk w="the"/> 40 <unk w="million"/> .

I <unk w="have"/> always applied products with a <unk w="new"/> approach <unk w="to"/> other human beings as well as <unk w="consumers"/> .

I <unk w="have"/> incurred <unk w="the"/> apparent detriment to my health <unk w="and"/> the wellbeing of the environment .

I therefore find it distressing that <unk w="the"/> possible <unk w="use"/> of many products , including the triazole fungicides , is based <unk w="on"/> less than scientific arguments and will make <unk w="more"/> business not particularly viable and <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="use"/> of home-produced food ' .

I received these comments from him and from literally <unk w="because"/> of other <unk w="countries"/> , from Empire World Trade , based in Spalding in Lincolnshire , John Manby in <unk w="the"/> Farms in <unk w="germany"/> , John Clark , <unk w="which"/> is based in Nottinghamshire , Jonathan Reading and hundreds more names .

<unk w="mr"/> President , now <unk w="that"/> this <unk w="debate"/> is <unk w="important"/> and the arguments have <unk w="been"/> made , I <unk w="would"/> like <unk w="to"/> come back to something <unk w="which"/> ran through the debate <unk w=","/> and in the committee .

<unk w="why"/> was the <unk w="only"/> mistrust <unk w="of"/> farmers and an assumption by many that <unk w="they"/> are somehow enemies of health <unk w="and"/> the environment .

<unk w="in"/> my experience this is the opposite of the truth .

Farmers <unk w="in"/> Ireland <unk w="too"/> , and have been , <unk w="and"/> who <unk w="for"/> thousands <unk w="of"/> years have <unk w="been"/> and <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="case"/> , <unk w="as"/> it <unk w="is"/> , clean and <unk w="faster"/> .

Similarly , farmers have also been the <unk w="future"/> of our health .

<unk w="we"/> produce the <unk w="only"/> food that is the basis of our good health .

I <unk w="would"/> urge you <unk w="to"/> renew our faith in our farmers , who <unk w="are"/> doing their <unk w="right"/> to <unk w="find"/> us in very difficult situations , circumstances of weather , pest <unk w="and"/> , of course , EU <unk w="citizens"/> .

<unk w="in"/> writing . - We <unk w="have"/> just voted on an agreement <unk w="on"/> civil <unk w="aviation"/> safety .

Although <unk w=","/> by air <unk w="is"/> one of <unk w="the"/> safest <unk w="modes"/> of travel , however , one can <unk w="only"/> take measures which <unk w="are"/> too safe .

<unk w="alongside"/> the horrendous <unk w="racist"/> attack on <unk w="the"/> twin towers , innumerable security <unk w="should"/> have been <unk w="involved"/> in <unk w="future"/> .

Just <unk w="on"/> the issue of safety one can never be too secure .

<unk w="however"/> , it <unk w="is"/> when <unk w="i"/> feel too secure that terror strikes again .

Of course , one has to find a <unk w="balance"/> between civil liberties and <unk w="political"/> and security measures ; however , when <unk w="it"/> comes <unk w="back"/> to a <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> one has to prioritise .

<unk w="for"/> instance , there has <unk w="been"/> a substantial <unk w="lack"/> of opposition to the <unk w="idea"/> of <unk w="european"/> lists on <unk w="the"/> basis of data protection .

<unk w="this"/> surely <unk w=","/> security measures will <unk w="be"/> an <unk w="incredible"/> analysis <unk w="as"/> possible at the frontiers .

Innocent civilians are purposely targeted and the <unk w="legacy"/> of <unk w="third"/> countries <unk w="involved"/> .

<unk w="as"/> such an <unk w="issue"/> surely we are not expecting <unk w="third"/> countries to <unk w="know"/> from doing all that which <unk w="is"/> possible to protect the interests <unk w="of"/> its citizens .

I <unk w="am"/> in favour of this report <unk w="on"/> the aviation <unk w="industry"/> in Romania will benefit <unk w="consumers"/> too .

The <unk w="framework"/> agreement reflects <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and large the structure of a conventional aviation safety agreement ; it is based <unk w="on"/> mutual trust <unk w="in"/> each other 's systems and on the comparison <unk w="of"/> regulatory differences .

This <unk w="principal"/> obligations and <unk w="responsibility"/> for cooperation between exporting and importing <unk w="countries"/> .

<unk w="however"/> , the <unk w="aim"/> of achieving this objective , namely cooperation <unk w="and"/> mutual acceptance of <unk w="the"/> other <unk w="and"/> certification findings in <unk w="the"/> areas of <unk w="health"/> and <unk w="training"/> , are set <unk w="out"/> in <unk w="the"/> annexes to the agreement , unlike <unk w="the"/> conventional agreements , <unk w="and"/> these measures <unk w="are"/> usually set <unk w="out"/> in separate non-binding <unk w="measures"/> at <unk w="european"/> aviation <unk w="safety"/> level .

The annexes broadly <unk w="mentions"/> the <unk w="application"/> of <unk w="the"/> Community <unk w="'s"/> Implementing Rules on <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> ( Commission Regulation <unk w="no"/> 1702 / <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> ) <unk w="on"/> maintenance ( Commission Regulation No 2042 / 2003 ) <unk w="should"/> be modified by <unk w="interested"/> parties based on a <unk w="series"/> of <unk w="the"/> Bilateral <unk w="management"/> Board .

<unk w="the"/> origins of the <unk w="fisheries"/> agreements <unk w="with"/> the <unk w="international"/> Community <unk w="and"/> the United <unk w="nations"/> ( US ) <unk w=","/> in <unk w="europe"/> are based on <unk w="the"/> liberalisation of air <unk w="traffic"/> .

<unk w="these"/> agreements established at EU level ( <unk w="or"/> rather , by the European Community - <unk w="the"/> only <unk w="means"/> that exists <unk w="in"/> law - <unk w="and"/> its <unk w="own"/> Community market , <unk w="when"/> they <unk w="need"/> to <unk w="help"/> liberalise ) <unk w="has"/> meant to prevail over any <unk w="commercial"/> agreements <unk w="and"/> between various Member States and the US .

<unk w="as"/> in <unk w="the"/> resolutions previously adopted by the <unk w="european"/> Parliament , <unk w="i"/> would highlight that we are obviously the first to be interested in <unk w="developing"/> a ' high level <unk w="of"/> civil <unk w="aviation"/> safety ' and measures ' to <unk w="promote"/> economic burdens <unk w="in"/> the aviation industry and operators from redundant regulatory oversight ' .

<unk w="however"/> , <unk w="we"/> must safeguard <unk w="two"/> important aspects : ( 1 ) the objective and presumed basis of these <unk w="measures"/> must not <unk w="apply"/> to <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and facilitate <unk w="the"/> conditions for <unk w="improving"/> the <unk w="use"/> of <unk w="intermodal"/> transport , through the <unk w="emission"/> of standards ; ( 2 ) these <unk w="measures"/> must <unk w="also"/> promote <unk w=","/> through a lowering of safety <unk w=","/> and <unk w="which"/> , in <unk w="countries"/> where , when safety , minimisation of burdens and <unk w="they"/> are mixed <unk w="up"/> , it is <unk w="important"/> and <unk w="essential"/> that prevail .

We <unk w="know"/> that <unk w="public"/> transport <unk w="must"/> be defended as a <unk w="public"/> service , provided by public companies in <unk w="the"/> country , which guarantee quality and safety <unk w="of"/> the services provided <unk w="by"/> citizens .

I agree in principle with <unk w="mr"/> Costa 's report on civil <unk w="society"/> .

It <unk w="is"/> important for the <unk w="commission"/> and the US <unk w="to"/> agree <unk w="on"/> a common <unk w="position"/> with the help of this <unk w="parliament"/> .

However , <unk w="it"/> is vital in <unk w="the"/> overseas partnership that we are real partners , not just on <unk w="it"/> .

<unk w="it"/> must be found to which both <unk w="should"/> must adhere .

In the event of <unk w="action"/> on the part of either the EU <unk w="and"/> the US , a rescindable variation in <unk w="the"/> agreement <unk w="will"/> be indispensable .

I voted in favour of the report <unk w="on"/> the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion <unk w="of"/> an Agreement between the European Community and the United States of America on <unk w="terrorism"/> in the regulation of civil aviation safety .

I <unk w="agree"/> with the rapporteur 's proposal on the conclusion <unk w="of"/> this agreement .

I <unk w="believe"/> that <unk w="the"/> objectives of the <unk w="treaty"/> , namely <unk w="that"/> of trade <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="eu"/> and <unk w="the"/> covered <unk w="by"/> the agreement , maximum limitation <unk w="on"/> the duplication of assessments , <unk w="monitoring"/> and controls <unk w="are"/> significant regulatory differences <unk w="in"/> use of the <unk w="european"/> system of either party to check conformity <unk w="on"/> the <unk w="laws"/> of the <unk w="socialist"/> party are <unk w="its"/> objectives .

I <unk w="believe"/> that <unk w="the"/> reliance on mutual trust of the <unk w="communist"/> party 's systems will favour <unk w="the"/> implementation of this <unk w="directive"/> .

As the <unk w="european"/> Parliament 's <unk w="proposal"/> for the <unk w="annual"/> report <unk w="on"/> the expansion of the European Aviation Safety Agency <unk w="("/> ( EASA ) powers , I welcome the negotiated <unk w="agreement"/> with the <unk w="member"/> States on facilitating mutual <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of civil aviation safety certificates .

This <unk w="therefore"/> marks an important step in expanding transatlantic cooperation , which is a priority objective <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="group"/> of the <unk w="european"/> People <unk w="'s"/> Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European <unk w="democrats"/> .

<unk w="it"/> establishes sound conditions for boosting trade in <unk w="goods"/> and services <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="european"/> aviation sector between the <unk w="european"/> Union and the United <unk w="states"/> , <unk w="which"/> undoubtedly benefits Europe .

The agreement offers enhanced guarantees as <unk w="food"/> safety and reinforcement <unk w="of"/> the compatibility of <unk w="noise"/> , components <unk w="and"/> aircraft with <unk w="the"/> increased demands of protecting <unk w="the"/> environment .

In <unk w="these"/> conditions , we <unk w="all"/> hope <unk w="that"/> the European <unk w="union"/> Sky <unk w="agency"/> will <unk w="be"/> extended in <unk w="the"/> future to <unk w="contribute"/> to transatlantic cooperation and that cooperation will <unk w="be"/> widened in <unk w="the"/> field <unk w="of"/> research , as <unk w="well"/> as the implementation of new technologies in <unk w="this"/> field , <unk w="and"/> on <unk w="relations"/> between SESAR and NextGen .

I believe that this agreement will facilitate in the long <unk w="term"/> the <unk w="most"/> beneficial extension of the cooperation <unk w="agreement"/> between <unk w="the"/> EASA <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="eu"/> , <unk w="from"/> which airlines , the aviation <unk w="industry"/> and , more significantly , passengers will directly benefit .

<unk w="the"/> future of <unk w="the"/> external transport <unk w="policy"/> requires good relations between <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> and <unk w="the"/> United <unk w="states"/> .

As a result , <unk w="one"/> of <unk w="the"/> fundamental points <unk w="of"/> this <unk w="draft"/> agreement <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="field"/> of <unk w="european"/> aviation <unk w="sector"/> is mutual <unk w="respect"/> in each <unk w="country"/> 's systems and the <unk w="lack"/> of regulatory differences .

<unk w="the"/> objective of <unk w="the"/> agreement is <unk w="to"/> facilitate trade in goods and <unk w="services"/> in <unk w="the"/> aviation sector , <unk w="and"/> limiting as much as possible the duplication <unk w="of"/> assessments , tests and controls to significant regulatory differences between the <unk w="various"/> parties .

<unk w="i"/> therefore believe that a framework is being created which <unk w="will"/> work smoothly on a daily basis <unk w=","/> which <unk w="will"/> allow technical issues arising from <unk w="the"/> implementation to be solved through a <unk w="series"/> of continual cooperation <unk w="and"/> consultation .

This agreement <unk w="is"/> another fundamental step in <unk w="the"/> external dimension of <unk w="the"/> European transport policy , which <unk w="is"/> why I voted <unk w="in"/> favour of this report .

Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I <unk w="would"/> like to <unk w="say"/> that I <unk w="am"/> in favour of Mr Costa 's <unk w="report"/> on the conclusion <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="agreement"/> between the European Community and the United States of <unk w="europe"/> on cooperation <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="ministry"/> of civil <unk w="aviation"/> safety , as <unk w="carried"/> out <unk w="by"/> the <unk w="proposal"/> for a Council <unk w="decision"/> .

I <unk w="agree"/> with <unk w="the"/> rapporteur in <unk w="saying"/> that Parliament must declare <unk w="itself"/> in favour of <unk w="the"/> conclusion <unk w="of"/> the agreement because this <unk w="will"/> clearly <unk w="reflects"/> the trade in <unk w="goods"/> and services between the <unk w="eu"/> in the airworthiness and maintenance sector , avoiding <unk w="which"/> redundant duplication <unk w="and"/> assessments <unk w="and"/> checks on compliance with <unk w="safety"/> requirements , which <unk w="have"/> now <unk w="have"/> had to <unk w="be"/> repeated even if <unk w="they"/> are very similar <unk w="to"/> one <unk w="another"/> .

I <unk w="believe"/> , however , that the <unk w="directive"/> should be applied provisionally at <unk w="present"/> , <unk w="so"/> that we <unk w="can"/> identify <unk w="the"/> practical and implementation difficulties and remove them <unk w="by"/> proceeding <unk w="its"/> final approval .

I voted in favour <unk w="of"/> this <unk w="proposal"/> for better <unk w="a"/> regulation of <unk w="safety"/> within <unk w="the"/> EU .

I <unk w="am"/> in favour <unk w="of"/> the report on the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> system of taxation <unk w="relating"/> to <unk w="avail"/> , divisions , partial divisions , transfers of assets and exchanges <unk w="and"/> shares concerning <unk w="citizens"/> of different Member States as <unk w="regards"/> legal transactions result in fundamental changes <unk w="to"/> commercial <unk w="companies"/> ' <unk w="s"/> status .

The European Union also needs to <unk w="take"/> the necessary measures to provide <unk w="effective"/> , harmonised <unk w="and"/> effective <unk w="implementation"/> .

I <unk w="have"/> supported it because I am a lawyer and I will continue to support in the <unk w="european"/> Parliament every effort <unk w="not"/> to harmonise and codify at <unk w="european"/> level fiscal , <unk w="cooperation"/> , civil and criminal regulations .

I <unk w="am"/> in favour <unk w="of"/> this <unk w="report"/> as the <unk w="result"/> of <unk w="members"/> of the Court of First Instance lack any provision <unk w="relating"/> to the language required to <unk w="be"/> used <unk w="to"/> appeal proceedings ( against <unk w="behalf"/> of the Civil Service Tribunal ) .

<unk w="it"/> is , in <unk w="fact"/> , no equivalent <unk w="to"/> Article 110 of <unk w="the"/> Rules <unk w="of"/> Procedure of <unk w="the"/> Court of Justice .

<unk w="mr"/> President , following the last armed <unk w="crisis"/> in <unk w="the"/> Balkans , <unk w="member"/> states made widely differing <unk w="views"/> on the <unk w="ground"/> .

<unk w="however"/> , by its active engagement in <unk w="the"/> situation <unk w="has"/> existed , the EU <unk w="considers"/> that the Balkans <unk w="is"/> an important <unk w="task"/> for us <unk w="to"/> are an <unk w="important"/> part of Europe .

<unk w="we"/> are <unk w="therefore"/> obliged to support these countries in their efforts to <unk w="achieve"/> stability <unk w="and"/> full democracy .

I endorsed <unk w="the"/> Belder report because it underlines the need to <unk w="assist"/> the <unk w="member"/> states , <unk w="and"/> treating <unk w="it"/> as individual , independent <unk w="media"/> .

<unk w="however"/> , it is <unk w="clear"/> that the report underlines the need to establish a common <unk w="foreign"/> policy .

The diversification of sources is urgently needed , and this would benefit <unk w="not"/> only the <unk w="consumer"/> , but the <unk w="whole"/> of Europe .

<unk w="in"/> writing . - <unk w="the"/> report <unk w="by"/> Mr Belder considers <unk w="the"/> current <unk w="reform"/> of the European <unk w="union"/> 's <unk w="political"/> and economic <unk w="cooperation"/> with <unk w="an"/> increasingly <unk w="asian"/> region , where <unk w="these"/> countries hold candidateship for EU membership .

The role of the <unk w="community"/> as a <unk w="major"/> partner for <unk w="the"/> area <unk w=","/> maintaining trade and <unk w="economic"/> relations while <unk w=","/> for a <unk w="democratic"/> , <unk w="a"/> peace in the area <unk w="is"/> a very important <unk w="one"/> .

The EU <unk w="'s"/> strength <unk w="as"/> an economic partner , <unk w="but"/> also as a <unk w="substitute"/> for a <unk w="democratic"/> civil society , government and <unk w="public"/> institutions , should be <unk w="open"/> to push for <unk w="the"/> development of <unk w="the"/> region .

A threefold <unk w="of"/> differentiated approach , <unk w="taking"/> into account <unk w="the"/> relative <unk w="coherence"/> between countries in <unk w="the"/> region as <unk w="well"/> as <unk w="horizontal"/> agreements and further <unk w="harmonisation"/> , <unk w="in"/> a clear way <unk w="to"/> address issues <unk w="of"/> underdevelopment <unk w="and"/> shore <unk w=","/> intensive <unk w="european"/> and international economic cooperation .

As a means of <unk w="ensuring"/> a lasting peace and promoting <unk w="the"/> ideals to which <unk w="we"/> are all committed , I support Mr <unk w="morillon"/> 's <unk w="report"/> .

I <unk w="support"/> the Belder report <unk w="which"/> deals <unk w="with"/> the <unk w="economic"/> and commercial <unk w="relations"/> with the <unk w="western"/> Balkans <unk w="is"/> the evident <unk w="need"/> for the European Union to assist <unk w="all"/> their reconstruction , <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="economic"/> , legal , political and social <unk w="rights"/> .

I am surprised , though , <unk w="that"/> , <unk w="in"/> the statement that this aid , <unk w="as"/> well <unk w="as"/> the <unk w="decision-making"/> processes , <unk w="must"/> be <unk w="transparent"/> and <unk w="corresponding"/> to each country , <unk w="the"/> report does not really <unk w="take"/> into account the specific <unk w="situation"/> of each country .

Above all , this <unk w="is"/> , always <unk w="lead"/> to <unk w="the"/> violations of <unk w="human"/> rights around the world <unk w=","/> to demand ' human <unk w="beings"/> ' clauses in <unk w="horizontal"/> cooperation agreements , has <unk w="been"/> the master stroke of <unk w="voting"/> for a report on the Balkans without once <unk w="again"/> the <unk w="political"/> and <unk w="the"/> situation of the Serb populations in Kosovo , who have <unk w="been"/> pariahs <unk w="and"/> the historical <unk w="exploitation"/> of <unk w="the"/> fathers .

<unk w="however"/> , it congratulates itself on the hundreds of <unk w="millions"/> of euros given to the authorities who <unk w="propose"/> , organise or tolerate this <unk w="debate"/> .

<unk w="the"/> consolidation <unk w="of"/> economic relations with the <unk w="western"/> Balkans is of immense importance both to the EU and to the Western Balkans .

I therefore welcome the fact that the European <unk w="union"/> is working intensively on <unk w="this"/> issue <unk w="and"/> that we adopted <unk w="the"/> Belder report today .

In <unk w="view"/> of the fact that <unk w="in"/> future <unk w="of"/> the countries <unk w="of"/> the Western <unk w="balkans"/> lies <unk w="within"/> the EU , <unk w="the"/> economic and political rapprochement <unk w="in"/> the EU is very <unk w="important"/> .

In order to tie these <unk w="agreements"/> to the <unk w="crisis"/> in the long <unk w="term"/> , the development of their <unk w="local"/> economies <unk w="and"/> regional <unk w="development"/> must be <unk w="involved"/> .

That is why constructive and positive signals <unk w="from"/> the European <unk w="union"/> are also important .

It <unk w="is"/> in <unk w="the"/> interests of <unk w="the"/> EU to champion <unk w="the"/> creation <unk w="of"/> political stability , <unk w="social"/> security and hence good framework conditions <unk w="in"/> these countries <unk w="in"/> foreign <unk w="policy"/> .

The Belder <unk w="report"/> underlines the fact that <unk w="the"/> level of economic relations <unk w="based"/> on <unk w="turkey"/> in each individual country .

Moreover , it should be the <unk w="commission"/> 's objective to diversify the national economies of <unk w="the"/> countries of the <unk w="western"/> Balkans .

I <unk w="am"/> convinced that a positive development in economic <unk w="cooperation"/> between the EU <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="western"/> Balkans will be of <unk w="interest"/> to all countries <unk w="on"/> the continent <unk w="of"/> Europe and I await <unk w="the"/> implementation of our proposals with anticipation .

<unk w="mr"/> President , ladies <unk w="and"/> gentlemen , I voted in favour of the report by Mr Belder on trade <unk w="and"/> economic relations with the Western <unk w="balkans"/> .

I agree with <unk w="my"/> fellow Member in considering that the European Union has a vital <unk w="role"/> to play <unk w="in"/> the process of <unk w="democratic"/> and political <unk w="integration"/> of <unk w="reconstruction"/> in the Western <unk w="balkans"/> area , with a view to their membership of <unk w="the"/> European Union , firstly in <unk w="terms"/> of stabilising the political situation and <unk w="participate"/> in economic and trade terms .

I would <unk w="therefore"/> like to emphasise the need for the Union to conduct an in-depth analysis of the situation <unk w="with"/> regard to <unk w="respect"/> for human rights and <unk w="democratic"/> principles within each country .

I <unk w="am"/> in <unk w="addition"/> to <unk w="parliament"/> and <unk w="the"/> numerous <unk w="thousand"/> expatriates who continue to <unk w="be"/> clearly <unk w="discriminated"/> against in that country , despite Croatia 's <unk w="own"/> application <unk w="for"/> admission to <unk w="the"/> EU .

This aspect is , <unk w="in"/> my opinion , at odds <unk w="with"/> the situation <unk w="in"/> Serbia , a country <unk w="which"/> has only been granted <unk w="the"/> status <unk w="a"/> potential candidate and to <unk w="join"/> the Union should <unk w="be"/> more open <unk w="than"/> it <unk w="has"/> been <unk w="done"/> now .

I <unk w="voted"/> for <unk w="the"/> report on trade and <unk w="economic"/> relations <unk w="with"/> the Western Balkans as the <unk w="proposal"/> for a European Parliament resolution also includes the opinion of the Committee on <unk w="legal"/> Affairs <unk w="and"/> that of the <unk w="committee"/> on Regional Development <unk w=","/> which I am a member .

<unk w="the"/> growth <unk w="and"/> development in <unk w="the"/> Western <unk w="mediterranean"/> region will <unk w="create"/> the conditions <unk w="for"/> constructive partnerships with <unk w="the"/> EU <unk w="and"/> eastern <unk w="member"/> States , which <unk w="also"/> includes <unk w="it"/> too .

At the same <unk w="time"/> , linking the <unk w="eu"/> and <unk w="the"/> policies of <unk w="the"/> countries <unk w="and"/> the Western <unk w="balkans"/> to <unk w="the"/> European Union 's <unk w="political"/> will support <unk w="the"/> stabilisation and association agreements <unk w="and"/> between <unk w="the"/> EU and these countries .

I voted <unk w="in"/> favour of this report because economic stability may <unk w="well"/> lead to political stability <unk w="in"/> this <unk w="area"/> , <unk w="which"/> has been <unk w="very"/> troubled over the years .

<unk w="the"/> EU should use <unk w="the"/> available <unk w="technology"/> in <unk w="order"/> to motivate the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> Balkans region <unk w="and"/> persuade <unk w="them"/> to carry out essential <unk w="questions"/> .

<unk w="the"/> expansion <unk w="of"/> regional economic <unk w="sector"/> appears <unk w="to"/> be <unk w="very"/> significant in <unk w="this"/> context , as <unk w="it"/> is the <unk w="question"/> of membership for states in the <unk w="eu"/> .

<unk w="loud"/> and stable <unk w="bilateral"/> contacts between <unk w="third"/> countries would <unk w="have"/> to <unk w="achieve"/> economic integration , which would <unk w="also"/> help to limit <unk w="the"/> threat of conflict in <unk w="the"/> future .

<unk w="the"/> Balkans have <unk w="been"/> made <unk w="the"/> advances <unk w="in"/> the road to <unk w="cooperation"/> with <unk w="the"/> EU , <unk w="and"/> the prospect <unk w="of"/> accession <unk w="to"/> most <unk w="to"/> encourage <unk w="them"/> to continue their <unk w="lives"/> at <unk w="all"/> with <unk w="the"/> Community .

I would like <unk w="to"/> emphasise , <unk w="however"/> , that <unk w="the"/> instruments of economic support , initiatives which aim to integrate Balkan society <unk w="in"/> the EU are equally <unk w="important"/> .

Therefore <unk w="the"/> introduction of changes , which should be as far-reaching as possible and which <unk w="would"/> make <unk w="free"/> movement <unk w="of"/> people easier , <unk w="the"/> very <unk w="much"/> , as <unk w="there"/> is broad support for the region 's young people .

<unk w="even"/> if <unk w="the"/> people of the Balkans feel that they <unk w="have"/> equal rights with the <unk w="european"/> citizens <unk w="of"/> Europe <unk w="will"/> we be able to say that we <unk w="have"/> achieved <unk w="this"/> .

I <unk w="cannot"/> agree with what <unk w="mr"/> Belder had to say and <unk w="in"/> his recommendations on how to improve trade and <unk w="economic"/> relations <unk w="with"/> the <unk w="western"/> Balkans .

The <unk w="eib"/> has a key role <unk w="to"/> play in the <unk w="future"/> of that <unk w="country"/> .

The <unk w="stabilisation"/> and association agreements , the trade <unk w="unions"/> and technical <unk w="and"/> financial support <unk w="for"/> the three pillars on the basis <unk w="of"/> which <unk w="the"/> EU hopes <unk w="to"/> bring stability to that region .

It <unk w="is"/> true that the level <unk w="of"/> development and adoption of the acquis communautaire <unk w="is"/> not the same in all <unk w="the"/> countries <unk w="in"/> that region , <unk w="and"/> so , in <unk w="spite"/> of <unk w="developing"/> a <unk w="global"/> strategy , it is <unk w="possible"/> to <unk w="find"/> specific approaches , which must be tailored <unk w="to"/> the <unk w="situation"/> in question .

The progress of the accession negotiations ( or <unk w="without"/> opening in <unk w="the"/> case <unk w="of"/> potential candidate countries ) with <unk w="the"/> Western Balkan <unk w="countries"/> should , obviously , depend on full <unk w="compliance"/> with the Copenhagen criteria and unconditional respect for the <unk w="principles"/> of <unk w="democracy"/> and human rights .

Let <unk w="us"/> be clear , though , <unk w="that"/> all those countries <unk w="have"/> a future in the <unk w="union"/> and <unk w="that"/> their membership will ensure that the dreadful conflicts <unk w="will"/> have typified <unk w="the"/> region for centuries are <unk w="not"/> a thing <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="future"/> .

The <unk w="european"/> Union <unk w="has"/> played an immensely important role in the process of economic <unk w="and"/> political reconstruction <unk w="of"/> the countries of the former <unk w="yugoslavia"/> .

<unk w="however"/> , it has undertaken an enormous <unk w="deal"/> with <unk w="regard"/> to the whole of <unk w="the"/> Western <unk w="union"/> .

In connection <unk w="with"/> this , <unk w="the"/> EU is currently faced with <unk w="the"/> difficult task of reconstruction <unk w="in"/> the entire region .

<unk w="the"/> EU has <unk w="become"/> the main trading partner of <unk w="all"/> the countries <unk w="of"/> the Western Balkans .

The <unk w="three"/> most important <unk w="aspect"/> of this cooperation <unk w="is"/> : <unk w="horizontal"/> agreements , trade preferences , <unk w="the"/> technical and financial <unk w="management"/> .

The process of <unk w="enlargement"/> should <unk w="therefore"/> all be directed <unk w="at"/> raising the <unk w="new"/> standard and ensuring permanent <unk w="sustainable"/> development in the Balkan <unk w="region"/> .

In undertaking <unk w="these"/> actions , however , the EU <unk w="should"/> bear in mind the membership of some <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="countries"/> in <unk w="the"/> EU and <unk w="the"/> status <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="eu"/> as potential <unk w="lines"/> for <unk w="it"/> .

It is <unk w="important"/> not to <unk w="agree"/> with <unk w="the"/> rapporteur that a basic condition <unk w="for"/> development <unk w="of"/> the countries under <unk w="question"/> is membership <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="free"/> Trade Organization ( <unk w="kosovo"/> , Albania and the <unk w="former"/> Yugoslavia <unk w="is"/> already members ) .

For full integration with the <unk w="new"/> system of trade to take place , it is essential that Bosnia and <unk w="kosovo"/> , Serbia and Montenegro <unk w="to"/> join <unk w="the"/> WTO .

While appreciating <unk w="the"/> progress already made <unk w="in"/> terms of modernisation <unk w="in"/> the region , full integration of the <unk w="western"/> Balkans <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="european"/> economic <unk w="policy"/> should <unk w="be"/> pursued .

in <unk w="afghanistan"/> . - ( SV ) The report on the <unk w="common"/> agricultural policy and global <unk w="social"/> security discusses important issues <unk w="such"/> as the consequences of rising food prices in poor and <unk w="developing"/> countries <unk w=","/> the importance of securing access to food for <unk w="peace"/> .

<unk w="we"/> Swedish <unk w="christian"/> Democrats <unk w="wish"/> to vote <unk w="for"/> the report , as it contains <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> wordings <unk w="in"/> relation <unk w="to"/> agricultural policy .

Among other things , <unk w="i"/> would <unk w="like"/> to <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> a reduction <unk w="in"/> the proportion of <unk w="the"/> EU budget <unk w="line"/> to <unk w="foreign"/> policy , the retention and <unk w="principles"/> of <unk w="democracy"/> and the adaptation of <unk w="the"/> system to the <unk w="eu"/> .

The report <unk w="is"/> not in line <unk w="with"/> these views <unk w="and"/> we are therefore <unk w="voting"/> against <unk w="it"/> .

in writing . - <unk w="the"/> sustainable food <unk w="safety"/> is one of the <unk w="major"/> challenges that <unk w="enable"/> us .

<unk w="this"/> challenge will continue to <unk w="be"/> as the world <unk w="'s"/> population expands .

<unk w="this"/> means <unk w="that"/> food for 70 million more people every year .

How will <unk w="we"/> manage this <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> already over 850 million people <unk w="in"/> the world <unk w="of"/> undernourished ?

While securing sustainable food <unk w="production"/> is <unk w="one"/> of our greatest <unk w="concern"/> , <unk w="the"/> EU is one of the <unk w="great"/> success <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of recent <unk w="years"/> , <unk w="has"/> brought peace , stability and prosperity <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="eu"/> .

The EU is the <unk w="only"/> giver of ODA <unk w=","/> is a model for <unk w="international"/> cooperation , <unk w="we"/> can <unk w="use"/> this experience to <unk w="make"/> use globally .

The EU cannot afford <unk w="to"/> follow policy lines that are narrow <unk w="and"/> scope .

<unk w="and"/> as international fortunes are intertwined , there is more and more <unk w="in"/> between policy areas .

<unk w="this"/> report is <unk w="a"/> acknowledgment of this and a recognition that the <unk w="eu"/> 's high standards <unk w="of"/> wealth of agricultural experience can <unk w="be"/> of a wider value in addressing global food security , including <unk w="by"/> providing funding for <unk w="medical"/> and high-yield seeds , <unk w="as"/> well <unk w="as"/> training <unk w="and"/> practical support <unk w="for"/> farmers <unk w="and"/> food producers .

in writing . - ( <unk w="sv"/> ) Anne E. <unk w=","/> and <unk w="mr"/> Busk have <unk w="been"/> in <unk w="terms"/> of <unk w="mr"/> McGuinness 's <unk w="annual"/> report on the <unk w="common"/> agricultural policy <unk w=":"/> global <unk w="social"/> security , as the majority of the report <unk w="is"/> excellent and it is only possible to <unk w="vote"/> either <unk w="in"/> favour or <unk w="not"/> .

However , <unk w="we"/> cannot <unk w="accept"/> paragraphs <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> and <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> , which raise doubts about free trade <unk w="in"/> agricultural products .

We are <unk w="also"/> supporters of free <unk w="movement"/> and <unk w="ensure"/> that it is <unk w="the"/> right <unk w="to"/> work <unk w="to"/> bring about a situation in which trade in agricultural products is based on <unk w="world"/> market <unk w="rules"/> .

in writing . - ( DA ) The Danish Members of the <unk w="socialist"/> Group in the European Parliament have voted <unk w="for"/> the own-initiative report on the common agricultural policy and global food security , as the report opposes <unk w="the"/> liberalisation of agricultural policy and <unk w="the"/> EU rules on the restriction of <unk w="gmos"/> .

We believe it <unk w="is"/> necessary to have <unk w="free"/> access to the <unk w="european"/> food supply , but <unk w="that"/> this will <unk w="not"/> be helped by either <unk w="parliament"/> or extending the EU 's agricultural <unk w="policy"/> .

The global food problem is <unk w="a"/> rather <unk w="than"/> shrinking <unk w="it"/> affects <unk w="the"/> grassroots classes , not <unk w="only"/> in <unk w="the"/> less developed countries , <unk w="but"/> also in the <unk w="least"/> developed countries .

<unk w="the"/> main <unk w="purpose"/> of this situation <unk w="is"/> that the basic criterion for the production <unk w="of"/> agricultural produce <unk w=","/> food <unk w="for"/> profit <unk w="rather"/> than <unk w="other"/> food requirements .

<unk w="the"/> trading of <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> on <unk w="stock"/> exchanges <unk w="has"/> resulted in spiralling price <unk w=","/> and , hence , spiralling profits for the food multinationals , a <unk w="significant"/> reduction in rural <unk w="areas"/> and global <unk w="capital"/> reserves and <unk w="an"/> increase in the number <unk w="of"/> malnourished people .

In order <unk w="to"/> address this unacceptable situation , which condemns one billion people <unk w="from"/> malnourishment and <unk w="finally"/> , the report confines itself <unk w="to"/> wish <unk w=","/> which are cancelled out by its insistence on abiding <unk w="is"/> the same policy : support for the common <unk w="fisheries"/> policy and its reviews and ' health check ' , the completion <unk w="of"/> negotiations in <unk w="the"/> World Trade Organization , <unk w="the"/> decoupling <unk w="the"/> aid from <unk w="turkey"/> and the continuing production of biofuels , <unk w="on"/> the pretext of <unk w="the"/> environment <unk w=","/> using land which could <unk w="be"/> used to produce food .

<unk w="this"/> barely touches <unk w="on"/> the <unk w="area"/> of food <unk w="safety"/> and security and the right to self-sufficiency <unk w="in"/> food .

<unk w="the"/> MEPs from the Communist Party <unk w="of"/> Greece <unk w="voted"/> against <unk w="the"/> report <unk w="today"/> , <unk w="in"/> its <unk w="'"/> and ' wishes ' , it supports the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , <unk w="a"/> policy which <unk w="is"/> condemning more and <unk w="more"/> people <unk w="are"/> malnourishment and <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .

in <unk w="afghanistan"/> . - ( SV ) It is important <unk w="that"/> we combat <unk w="to"/> alleviate <unk w="disease"/> .

<unk w="in"/> this respect , I welcome the content of Mrs <unk w="lucas"/> 's own-initiative report on the <unk w="common"/> agricultural <unk w="sector"/> and global food security .

I have , <unk w="therefore"/> , <unk w="agreed"/> to abstain , because the <unk w="minute"/> was strongly protectionist in places .

Subsidising and <unk w="if"/> our domestic agriculture does not promote <unk w="the"/> goal of an <unk w="enlarged"/> , green , safe <unk w="and"/> enterprising EU .

A freer <unk w="european"/> market <unk w="for"/> agricultural products <unk w="would"/> make it easier <unk w="for"/> people in poor countries to develop <unk w="european"/> agriculture .

We <unk w="are"/> seeing this now in <unk w="many"/> parts <unk w="of"/> Africa , in particular .

We <unk w="agree"/> with various aspects <unk w="made"/> by the <unk w="commission"/> , in particular :

the fact that the policy shift has resulted in a loss <unk w="of"/> potential market <unk w="and"/> for EU producers <unk w="and"/> has led to <unk w="a"/> reliance on imported food from outside <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> , produced to very different production standards , thereby placing EU agricultural products at a disadvantage ;

<unk w="the"/> concern <unk w="the"/> dramatic increases in <unk w="densely"/> production costs may result in less usage and reduced <unk w="charges"/> , <unk w="which"/> will exacerbate the food crisis <unk w="in"/> Europe and the world ;

the need for policy instruments aimed at averting <unk w="the"/> large and damaging price fluctuations ;

<unk w="the"/> concern <unk w="is"/> increasing market concentration in the <unk w="large"/> retail <unk w="sector"/> , which has led to <unk w="the"/> development of <unk w="cooperation"/> , and the need for <unk w="alternative"/> solutions in negotiations <unk w="with"/> retailers , <unk w="in"/> favour of small farmers .

However , there are <unk w="two"/> aspects with which <unk w="we"/> cannot <unk w="accept"/> :

the <unk w="political"/> orientation <unk w="of"/> the common agricultural policy towards the market and the devaluation of <unk w="national"/> sovereignty , <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="emphasis"/> solely <unk w="and"/> placed <unk w="on"/> food security , <unk w="but"/> that <unk w="it"/> is difficult <unk w="for"/> food sovereignty .

The McGuinness report tackles <unk w="the"/> issue that I regard as strategic : food security and the <unk w="creation"/> of strong <unk w="and"/> competitive European <unk w="markets"/> in a <unk w="new"/> world .

Following the recent <unk w="crisis"/> in food <unk w="production"/> , <unk w="social"/> security should be an EU <unk w="priority"/> .

Despite the fact that another food shortage <unk w="knew"/> is not foreseeable in <unk w="the"/> short term , <unk w="it"/> is likely that one will occur in the <unk w="future"/> , if we take into <unk w="account"/> the negative effects <unk w="of"/> climate change on agricultural <unk w="produce"/> and <unk w="the"/> constantly increasing demand .

<unk w="bearing"/> in mind <unk w="that"/> developing countries will probably not <unk w="be"/> able to <unk w="produce"/> food in sufficient <unk w="time"/> to supply their increasing <unk w="performance"/> , the industrialised <unk w="countries"/> will <unk w="have"/> to <unk w="be"/> the important task of <unk w="copyright"/> and <unk w="our"/> food .

The common agricultural policy <unk w="has"/> therefore once again become a <unk w="new"/> priority and form the <unk w="competitiveness"/> of the European food security policy , <unk w="and"/> that , in a time <unk w=","/> financial and economic crisis , it <unk w="is"/> more important than ever .

The <unk w="european"/> People <unk w="'s"/> Party <unk w="of"/> Freedom and Democracy ( VVD ) delegation has voted in favour <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="swoboda"/> report <unk w="on"/> the <unk w="common"/> agricultural <unk w="sector"/> and global food security , despite the <unk w="fact"/> that it <unk w="is"/> of some of the <unk w="amendments"/> in <unk w="this"/> report .

<unk w="the"/> VVD delegation would have liked to have seen <unk w="this"/> report clearly stipulate that the <unk w="reference"/> to trade in the developing <unk w="countries"/> should be <unk w="carried"/> out <unk w="of"/> reciprocity .

<unk w="in"/> this , it <unk w="would"/> have liked the report to have <unk w="voted"/> in favour of a special , <unk w="infringement"/> procedure <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="manufacture"/> of <unk w="pharmaceutical"/> products .

These still fall under the same procedure as ordinary <unk w="industrial"/> products , <unk w="despite"/> the fact that they make <unk w="use"/> of <unk w="raw"/> materials <unk w=","/> within the same species .

in writing . - The McGuinness report <unk w=","/> with <unk w="some"/> of <unk w="its"/> global importance .

In two years <unk w=","/> food prices have increased <unk w="to"/> over 80 % <unk w="of"/> cereal stocks have fallen to <unk w="very"/> low levels .

<unk w="communication"/> on global food <unk w="we"/> are <unk w="still"/> coming from relatively <unk w="different"/> sources <unk w="such"/> as the <unk w="road"/> towards increased <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .

I welcome the general <unk w="thrust"/> of this report and , <unk w="hence"/> , <unk w="is"/> in favour .

Madam President , I voted in favour of <unk w="adopting"/> the report by Mrs <unk w="karamanou"/> , <unk w="whom"/> I <unk w="would"/> like <unk w="to"/> draw <unk w="attention"/> to the following <unk w="points"/> in particular .

For the <unk w="same"/> time since <unk w="the"/> 1970s , <unk w="we"/> have <unk w="been"/> facing an acute worldwide <unk w="economic"/> crisis .

This crisis actually <unk w="exist"/> before the present global <unk w="economic"/> crisis , at a <unk w="time"/> when <unk w="the"/> maize <unk w="at"/> wheat prices skyrocketed <unk w="in"/> a very short <unk w="time"/> .

The food crisis may <unk w="have"/> changed its name to economic crisis , but the <unk w="situation"/> has unfortunately not gone <unk w="through"/> .

It is dreadful <unk w="to"/> think that , even before the problems posed by the current food crisis , <unk w="half"/> a billion people worldwide suffered from chronic hunger and malnutrition .

Food security - access <unk w="is"/> a sufficient , safe and nutritious <unk w="agricultural"/> supply - must now become a key <unk w="political"/> priority both here and elsewhere .

We cannot <unk w="tolerate"/> a situation where , while worldwide famine increases <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="production"/> of food soars , <unk w="even"/> in Europe are winding <unk w="european"/> agriculture <unk w=","/> and for the oddest <unk w="of"/> reasons .

<unk w="in"/> Finland , as in the other Member States , <unk w="we"/> must have <unk w="the"/> right to <unk w="engage"/> in profitable <unk w="terms"/> both now <unk w="and"/> in <unk w="the"/> future .

The food industry <unk w="has"/> a massive impact on <unk w="it"/> , as it provides <unk w=","/> for more <unk w="than"/> four <unk w="million"/> people in Europe .

The entire food chain in Finland is estimated to <unk w="say"/> approximately <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> 000 people , which is some <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> % of the employed workforce .

<unk w="there"/> is an unquestionable need <unk w="to"/> protect these people 's jobs <unk w="in"/> these times of food and economic <unk w="growth"/> .

in writing . - ( SV ) It is interesting to note <unk w="that"/> the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has not chosen <unk w="to"/> include <unk w="in"/> its report a key issue proposed by the <unk w="commission"/> on <unk w="fisheries"/> , which reads : ' the <unk w="european"/> Parliament calls on the <unk w="council"/> and the Commission , in <unk w="its"/> consultation with <unk w="the"/> ACP countries , to give <unk w="priority"/> to the question <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="eu"/> on <unk w="the"/> ACP countries of EU subsidies on the export of EU agricultural <unk w="produce"/> and to <unk w="contribute"/> to <unk w="the"/> specific , sustainable responses aimed <unk w="at"/> avoiding dumping , in <unk w="accordance"/> with the <unk w="progress"/> made in this area . '

<unk w="however"/> , in <unk w="this"/> report <unk w="it"/> is claimed <unk w="that"/> the EU <unk w="has"/> addressed <unk w="as"/> potentially trade-distorting elements of EU agricultural policy that can negatively <unk w="pressure"/> on farmers in the <unk w="rural"/> world .

The report complains that non-EU countries <unk w="contain"/> food to <unk w="the"/> different production <unk w="methods"/> , thereby exposing EU <unk w="pharmaceutical"/> products to unequal terms of competition .

These two claims in the <unk w="area"/> are controversial , to <unk w="say"/> the least , <unk w="is"/> not something that all <unk w="the"/> political forces <unk w="in"/> the EU would agree with .

If <unk w="that"/> were the case , could the Committee <unk w="on"/> Development <unk w="and"/> proposal <unk w="should"/> also be included in <unk w="the"/> text of <unk w="the"/> report ?

<unk w="this"/> report <unk w="is"/> also against reductions in aid payments within agriculture and is <unk w="equivalent"/> to any <unk w="part"/> of the common <unk w="fisheries"/> policy .

<unk w="however"/> , it proposes a <unk w="new"/> information policy regarding the <unk w="common"/> agricultural policy , which I view as <unk w="regards"/> propaganda for a <unk w="report"/> that is very controversial , <unk w="especially"/> in my country .

The recent <unk w="european"/> surge in <unk w="oil"/> prices rightly <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> a <unk w="debate"/> on agricultural <unk w="produce"/> , <unk w="social"/> security and development .

Regrettably , the <unk w="purpose"/> of <unk w="free"/> trade is often <unk w="apart"/> from <unk w="public"/> debates , <unk w="but"/> leading <unk w="to"/> the search for solutions which ignore <unk w="the"/> positive potential that increased world <unk w="trade"/> can have .

Although <unk w="only"/> this food <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> inflation poses a threat of famine for countries and populations without resources , <unk w="the"/> demands <unk w="for"/> humanitarian aid , <unk w="and"/> subsequently <unk w=","/> a <unk w="considerable"/> increase <unk w="in"/> food production capacity and a <unk w="reduction"/> in global trade .

This <unk w="is"/> an <unk w="opportunity"/> for the agricultural populations of the world , of which full <unk w="care"/> must be taken .

As <unk w="regards"/> Europe and the <unk w="common"/> agricultural policy , our <unk w="approach"/> to this <unk w="new"/> world context - with a potential for <unk w="economic"/> growth <unk w="than"/> expected - should <unk w="not"/> occur <unk w="in"/> the cost of either protectionism and new barriers <unk w="to"/> trade or market <unk w="competition"/> .

<unk w="wherever"/> medium- and long-term profitability of <unk w="european"/> agriculture and <unk w="rural"/> development should be the criteria used in the <unk w="european"/> agricultural <unk w="policy"/> and its reform .

This report <unk w="is"/> more <unk w="than"/> a defence of <unk w="the"/> current common <unk w="fisheries"/> policy than a comprehensive overview <unk w="of"/> food security <unk w="in"/> a starving world .

Despite <unk w=","/> I <unk w="have"/> supported it , because it draws attention to <unk w="the"/> importance of <unk w="public"/> access <unk w="to"/> credit for farmers in <unk w="third"/> countries <unk w="so"/> that <unk w="it"/> can modernise agricultural production and <unk w="improve"/> the output <unk w="and"/> quality <unk w="of"/> their food .

I <unk w="believe"/> that <unk w="the"/> report paid little <unk w="attention"/> to the risks of land being bought up <unk w="in"/> the world 's <unk w="developing"/> countries for growing and exporting the <unk w="highest"/> possible food to <unk w="the"/> rest <unk w="of"/> the world , at the expense of the <unk w="sustainable"/> development <unk w="and"/> needs <unk w="of"/> local populations in countries suffering <unk w="from"/> chronic food shortages .

Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in <unk w="favour"/> of the report <unk w="by"/> Mrs <unk w="lucas"/> on <unk w="the"/> common agricultural <unk w="policy"/> and <unk w="for"/> food security .

I <unk w="share"/> the concerns expressed by <unk w="our"/> fellow Member and draw attention <unk w="to"/> the need , which is <unk w="more"/> pressing <unk w="than"/> ever , for <unk w="these"/> measures <unk w="to"/> be <unk w="used"/> to <unk w="protect"/> all citizens <unk w="open"/> to healthy , <unk w="safe"/> food , whether <unk w="they"/> are resident within <unk w="the"/> European Union <unk w="or"/> elsewhere <unk w="in"/> the world .

I wish to emphasise <unk w="that"/> our efforts must <unk w="be"/> viewed from a <unk w="view"/> to long-term perspective <unk w="and"/> not focused merely on <unk w="the"/> short term .

It <unk w="would"/> not be enough <unk w="to"/> earmark <unk w="the"/> funding for <unk w="large"/> and <unk w="third"/> countries unless this <unk w="is"/> backed <unk w="by"/> a serious <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> by industrialised <unk w="countries"/> to ward off the <unk w="returns"/> on the <unk w="part"/> of <unk w="the"/> foods <unk w=","/> we have seen recently and introduce international agreements that take into account <unk w="the"/> very <unk w="important"/> situations of <unk w="problems"/> that belong to the World Trade Organization .

Otherwise <unk w="these"/> negotiations , <unk w="which"/> have already broken down , will continue to <unk w="have"/> little likelihood <unk w="of"/> success .

<unk w="in"/> writing . - <unk w="the"/> issue <unk w="of"/> the CAP and global <unk w="social"/> security is <unk w="concerned"/> .

We must make sure <unk w="that"/> we <unk w="play"/> our part in <unk w="the"/> EU <unk w="is"/> that <unk w="is"/> hungry across <unk w="the"/> world are fed .

<unk w="it"/> is a <unk w="fact"/> that there <unk w="are"/> people in <unk w="the"/> world starving to death <unk w="due"/> to our lack <unk w="of"/> political coordination .

The purpose <unk w="of"/> the common agricultural <unk w="policy"/> is <unk w="the"/> only <unk w="to"/> increase agricultural <unk w="policy"/> and ensure rational development of farming production <unk w="and"/> optimal use of production factors , <unk w="for"/> the workforce , but also to provide rural populations with a suitable standard of living , guarantee security <unk w=","/> supplies and ensure reasonable prices for supplies to <unk w="consumers"/> .

Access <unk w="is"/> sufficient <unk w="lists"/> of safe and nutritious <unk w="transport"/> is <unk w="therefore"/> a key political priority at <unk w="european"/> and <unk w="european"/> level .

<unk w="it"/> is disturbing <unk w="that"/> food prices are higher than in previous <unk w="years"/> , and world food stocks have <unk w="led"/> to a critically low level .

There <unk w="is"/> a <unk w="risk"/> that the world financial crisis may <unk w="be"/> developed countries not to honour their obligations <unk w="in"/> the area of aid to developing countries .

<unk w="tragic"/> and long-term action <unk w="is"/> needed to <unk w="create"/> world food <unk w="chain"/> and to <unk w="assist"/> those people who are <unk w="taken"/> seriously <unk w="involved"/> in <unk w="terms"/> of <unk w="the"/> nutritional needs .

The <unk w="european"/> challenge now <unk w="is"/> to develop a policy <unk w="on"/> agriculture and <unk w=","/> which will meet the needs <unk w="of"/> the increasingly numerous world <unk w="markets"/> , which , <unk w="according"/> to estimates , by the <unk w="year"/> 2050 will <unk w="have"/> grown <unk w="by"/> 40 % , <unk w="the"/> world <unk w="of"/> demand is expected to <unk w="arrive"/> in the same period .

Development of a policy which will <unk w="provide"/> farmers a <unk w="direct"/> income <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="country"/> they produce is a key political <unk w="issue"/> .

This is <unk w="of"/> fundamental importance in terms of <unk w="our"/> food production .

If the <unk w="eu"/> is not able to ensure this , it should <unk w="be"/> done through <unk w="foreign"/> policy .

in writing . - The Labour <unk w="market"/> will be <unk w="voting"/> in favour <unk w="of"/> the CAP and Global Food Security report , despite the strong reservations we <unk w="have"/> on <unk w="the"/> stance taken <unk w="by"/> the <unk w="commission"/> .

We <unk w="are"/> not <unk w="agree"/> with the prominent role attributed <unk w="to"/> the <unk w="consumer"/> in ensuring food <unk w="safety"/> nor <unk w="is"/> the criticism of the CAP reform , <unk w="which"/> has seen a shift away from quantity <unk w="for"/> quality production , the <unk w="human"/> being <unk w="in"/> this <unk w="and"/> undermined our <unk w="social"/> security .

Our <unk w="view"/> is that <unk w="we"/> need <unk w="to"/> modernise our <unk w="competition"/> policy , and not return <unk w="to"/> a production-based policy that encouraged massive <unk w="resistance"/> and a distortion of markets , undermining the ability of <unk w="developing"/> countries <unk w="to"/> produce <unk w="free"/> trade agricultural goods .

We do , however , feel that <unk w="this"/> report raises many very important points on the <unk w="future"/> of global food security , <unk w="such"/> as recognising the importance of food security as a <unk w="universal"/> political priority for the EU , urging for greater <unk w="action"/> on a global level , calling <unk w="for"/> more investment <unk w="in"/> developing <unk w="countries"/> to build <unk w="upon"/> their production capacities , and <unk w="not"/> for agriculture <unk w="to"/> be placed at <unk w="the"/> heart of the <unk w="eu"/> 's development agenda .

All of these points are equally <unk w="important"/> and demand <unk w="that"/> we <unk w="look"/> beyond the narrow focus <unk w="on"/> those using <unk w="this"/> issue as justification for a more interventionist <unk w="and"/> protectionist CAP <unk w="so"/> that we support the <unk w="report"/> .

<unk w="in"/> writing . - ( SV ) We Swedish Social <unk w="democrats"/> voted <unk w="in"/> favour of the <unk w="report"/> by <unk w="mr"/> Grabowska on the perspectives for developing civil dialogue <unk w="with"/> the Treaty of <unk w="nice"/> .

<unk w="in"/> the dialogue with civil society is <unk w="responsible"/> for creating an EU <unk w=","/> listens <unk w=","/> and <unk w="of"/> the views of its <unk w="government"/> .

<unk w="i"/> also agree with the demands <unk w="of"/> the report <unk w="'s"/> work in the Council to be more <unk w="effective"/> in order to <unk w="involve"/> civil society <unk w="and"/> participate in <unk w="the"/> dialogue in a <unk w="democratic"/> way .

However , we would like to make <unk w="it"/> clear that <unk w="i"/> believe it <unk w="should"/> be <unk w="possible"/> for churches <unk w="or"/> religious communities <unk w="to"/> be <unk w="given"/> a special <unk w="boycott"/> among civil society <unk w="'"/> .

<unk w="large"/> and religious communities should take part in the dialogue <unk w="between"/> the Union <unk w="'s"/> institutions in <unk w="the"/> same way as all other <unk w="countries"/> .

<unk w="mr"/> President , every initiative which aims to bring <unk w="europe"/> closer to <unk w="the"/> institutions <unk w="to"/> act <unk w="and"/> their <unk w="and"/> should <unk w="be"/> supported .

However , <unk w="measures"/> should be taken to ensure that <unk w="the"/> proposed <unk w="directive"/> is not by its <unk w="own"/> momentum transformed into <unk w="this"/> institution .

I endorsed the report <unk w="that"/> every step taken to bring <unk w="people"/> closer to the authorities which make decisions for <unk w="it"/> is a <unk w="step"/> towards a better and more transparent democracy .

<unk w="however"/> , I want <unk w="to"/> emphasise <unk w="this"/> , as is the case in every <unk w="case"/> , <unk w="but"/> also <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> the one concerning the <unk w="maastricht"/> Treaty the opinion of <unk w="my"/> party should <unk w="be"/> taken <unk w="into"/> account .

<unk w="in"/> writing . - <unk w="the"/> report <unk w="relates"/> to the Lisbon <unk w="summit"/> , which , <unk w="told"/> me <unk w=","/> you , is not <unk w="in"/> force .

<unk w="it"/> is therefore <unk w=","/> presumptuous , <unk w="and"/> to <unk w="the"/> arrogant , <unk w="to"/> be invoking the <unk w="abolition"/> of <unk w="the"/> Lisbon treaty as <unk w="if"/> it was <unk w=","/> a fact of <unk w="it"/> .

<unk w="the"/> case you had forgotten : the Lisbon treaty <unk w="is"/> sunk by <unk w="the"/> democratic will of <unk w="the"/> people of Ireland .

<unk w="we"/> put the <unk w="emphasis"/> on the project <unk w="because"/> they wanted a different kind <unk w="in"/> Europe .

In voting the way <unk w="we"/> did , the people of Ireland also <unk w="opted"/> for the <unk w="interests"/> of every other Member State , including my own , who were denied a <unk w="position"/> by their governments .

Ireland has been bullied into holding a <unk w="new"/> vote , but the <unk w="swedish"/> people are <unk w="prepared"/> to take kindly <unk w="their"/> being treated with <unk w="such"/> contempt .

In future , we should avoid bringing <unk w="them"/> into disrepute by discussing hypothetical <unk w="issues"/> such as the Lisbon <unk w="summit"/> .

<unk w="it"/> merely serves to <unk w="protect"/> the EU 's arrogant disregard <unk w="for"/> democratic opinion .

in writing . - ( NL ) I may be living on a different planet , <unk w="but"/> I seem to <unk w="say"/> that the Dutch <unk w="and"/> French people rejected <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> in a democratic <unk w="process"/> in <unk w="colombia"/> .

That Constitution is dead <unk w="and"/> buried , <unk w="at"/> least if we call <unk w="the"/> democrats .

The cursed Treaty of Lisbon , which is simply an airbrushed <unk w="part"/> of the Constitution , <unk w="but"/> exactly the same <unk w="time"/> , rejected , as <unk w="it"/> was , <unk w="in"/> a democratic <unk w="majority"/> by the Irish people .

<unk w="however"/> , <unk w="however"/> , refuses to accept the opinion of the people and <unk w="parliament"/> to ram <unk w="a"/> Constitution down the throats of Europeans through the <unk w="process"/> , pretending <unk w="that"/> everything in <unk w="the"/> garden is rosy <unk w="by"/> talking <unk w="about"/> a so-called ' dialogue <unk w="with"/> the citizen in the <unk w="light"/> of the Treaty of Lisbon ' <unk w="with"/> the greatest cynicism .

This is <unk w="going"/> to be a ' dialogue with the citizen ' , ' a <unk w="new"/> culture of consultation and <unk w="colombia"/> ' , whereby the rapporteur , in <unk w="the"/> cynicism , quotes <unk w="the"/> more <unk w="than"/> 10 of the Treaty on European <unk w="union"/> : ' Every citizen shall have the <unk w="right"/> to participate <unk w="in"/> the democratic life <unk w="of"/> the Union ' .

<unk w="this"/> may be true , <unk w="but"/> Europe does not take <unk w="much"/> notice of the democratic voice <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="eu"/> .

in writing . - This report <unk w=","/> Genowefa <unk w="report"/> provides <unk w="for"/> increased mechanisms <unk w="for"/> participation <unk w="in"/> for vehicles <unk w="in"/> civil <unk w="society"/> within <unk w="the"/> European Union .

<unk w="it"/> addresses the gap between members <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="eu"/> and <unk w="the"/> relationship they have with <unk w="the"/> institutions <unk w="to"/> serve them .

It recognises the need to <unk w="encourage"/> civil dialogue to maintain <unk w="its"/> engagement with the aims <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="european"/> project .

The recent <unk w="protocol"/> of the <unk w="ec"/> Treaty <unk w="in"/> Ireland <unk w=","/> in <unk w="fact"/> due to differences between the perception of <unk w="the"/> Union <unk w="and"/> the reality of <unk w="the"/> Union .

<unk w="but"/> the <unk w="complete"/> lack of <unk w="what"/> is key <unk w="to"/> achieving a genuine democratic partnership .

Central to this proposal is <unk w="the"/> insistence that <unk w="there"/> is reciprocal , that the opinions <unk w="which"/> need <unk w="to"/> be heeded <unk w="and"/> respected .

<unk w="in"/> this <unk w="report"/> , Ms Grabowska highlights both <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and representativeness as essential components <unk w="for"/> active civil dialogue and a genuine <unk w="european"/> democracy .

A more open <unk w="and"/> accessible Council , <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and <unk w="fully"/> integrated <unk w="development"/> cooperation , better use of new media as a means to connect with citizens <unk w="by"/> providing assistance <unk w="to"/> civil <unk w="union"/> institutions <unk w="to"/> help <unk w="bring"/> Europe closer <unk w="together"/> .

in <unk w="fact"/> . - <unk w="we"/> support any and all efforts to empower citizens , communities and civil <unk w="society"/> organisations with <unk w="regard"/> to <unk w="the"/> decision-making processes , including the EU .

<unk w="however"/> , <unk w="i"/> do not <unk w="think"/> that <unk w="the"/> Lisbon <unk w="summit"/> provides <unk w="a"/> real advance <unk w="in"/> this field .

<unk w="what"/> we believe <unk w="that"/> for <unk w="the"/> proposed Citizens Initiative to be meaningful , the Commission should be under a <unk w="legally"/> binding obligation to produce a White Paper <unk w="with"/> a <unk w="solution"/> to <unk w="the"/> proposal , or the Treaty <unk w="provides"/> for <unk w="years"/> taking <unk w="place"/> .

This report is <unk w="just"/> another one which <unk w="is"/> against the <unk w="role"/> of the European Parliament <unk w="and"/> its <unk w="desire"/> to try <unk w="the"/> ' <unk w="the"/> ' the <unk w="sort"/> of <unk w="a"/> project at any <unk w="rate"/> , a task <unk w="that"/> has not proved easy , judging <unk w="from"/> the results of previous referendums .

These <unk w="two"/> efforts have at least one merit : <unk w="they"/> clearly show <unk w="this"/> difficult and even painful it is <unk w="in"/> the Treaty 's advocates to find arguments to promote it .

No propaganda exists - and this is the <unk w="result"/> of the <unk w="commission"/> - which can disguise the anti-democratic <unk w="nature"/> of <unk w="the"/> insistence by <unk w="the"/> EU <unk w="'s"/> leaders on <unk w="yet"/> another referendum <unk w="in"/> Ireland <unk w="in"/> order to impose this proposed <unk w="ban"/> .

We do not share the narrow view of those who <unk w="believe"/> that developing a ' civil dialogue ' <unk w="is"/> a ' citizens ' initiative ' is sufficient to counteract the nature of a <unk w="directive"/> which , <unk w="as"/> a whole , prevents the <unk w="responsibility"/> of each Member State from defining their collective <unk w="interests"/> , <unk w="and"/> which insists on <unk w="the"/> resulting <unk w=","/> precarious jobs , increased working <unk w="conditions"/> , easier <unk w=","/> and the <unk w="use"/> of public <unk w="interest"/> .

<unk w="this"/> propaganda exists which can <unk w="make"/> the neoliberal , federalist <unk w="and"/> militarist <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> of <unk w="the"/> Treaty project .

Mrs Grabrowska 's report <unk w="proposes"/> permanent dialogue between all the <unk w="community"/> institutions and the ' representatives ' from civil <unk w="society"/> to define policies and draw <unk w="up"/> legislation at EU level , <unk w="in"/> other <unk w="than"/> a formal , compulsory organisation <unk w="of"/> participatory ' democracy ' at Union <unk w="level"/> .

The trouble <unk w="is"/> , participatory ' <unk w="farmers"/> ' <unk w="is"/> merely a <unk w="scheme"/> for <unk w="people"/> who <unk w="is"/> true <unk w="it"/> : <unk w="it"/> allows <unk w="them"/> to be <unk w="open"/> to the <unk w="economically"/> active organisations , <unk w="which"/> are <unk w="rarely"/> the most <unk w="representative"/> , and it appears <unk w="to"/> test citizens ' views <unk w="in"/> advance , the <unk w="better"/> to <unk w="be"/> able to <unk w="refuse"/> to consult <unk w="them"/> properly <unk w="later"/> on .

If the <unk w="Europe"/> of Brussels <unk w="wishes"/> to hear <unk w="the"/> citizens , let it <unk w="take"/> note of <unk w="the"/> French <unk w="and"/> Dutch ' no ' to the <unk w="European"/> Constitution and abandon <unk w="the"/> Treaty of Lisbon , <unk w="which"/> is a mere <unk w="copy"/> of <unk w="the"/> Constitution .
