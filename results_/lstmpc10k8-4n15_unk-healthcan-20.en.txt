The <unk w="world"/> Forum on Youth and Young Adult Tobacco Control Issues : Knowledge + Passion = Action was held in Ottawa February 25th to 28th of <unk w="it"/> .
<unk w="the"/> young <unk w="people"/> between <unk w="the"/> ages <unk w="between"/> 19 and 29 , and 60 youth aged 16-18 came together to talk <unk w="about"/> the <unk w="question"/> <unk w="on"/> tobacco control .
Young Canadians make up a <unk w="particular"/> portion of the smoking statistics in this country , however they are showing their <unk w="desire"/> <unk w="and"/> take a lead on <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w=","/> too .
The National <unk w="authorities"/> <unk w="will"/> <unk w="and"/> many of these motivated <unk w="young"/> people , giving <unk w="them"/> a place where they <unk w="can"/> discuss tobacco control and its <unk w="major"/> topics with their peers .
<unk w="this"/> <unk w="is"/> <unk w="is"/> an excellent chance for young people to <unk w="bring"/> about the National <unk w="plans"/> for Action on Youth and <unk w="rural"/> Adults and Tobacco Control [ a plan of action made especially for youth and young adults by the <unk w="state"/> Control Liaison <unk w="committee"/> ( TCLC ) <unk w="of"/> Health Canada ] , and a great way for youth and young adults from across the country <unk w=","/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="i"/> know with one another , learn new skills and discuss what is being done in their <unk w="entirety"/> .
The Forum was evaluated by <unk w="the"/> feedback <unk w="and"/> participants at <unk w="the"/> end of each day , and having them fill out a <unk w="very"/> extensive evaluation <unk w="apologise"/> at the end of the weekend .
Of <unk w="course"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> at the event , <unk w="i"/> filled <unk w="with"/> their Saturday Daily Feedback <unk w="and"/> , <unk w="and"/> handed back their Sunday Daily Feedback <unk w=","/> and 46% returned their Overall Feedback Form .
After the <unk w="debate"/> was over , conference planners <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> all of <unk w="its"/> forms <unk w="and"/> compiled the essence of what they said so changes can be made for <unk w="all"/> events .
; <unk w="but"/> they feel that <unk w="the"/> <unk w="conditions"/> were being <unk w="discriminated"/> and respected ? )
, as well as a number of questions <unk w=","/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="a"/> personal <unk w="data"/> on <unk w="a"/> weekend such as participant 's parting advice to Health <unk w="policy"/> , the best and <unk w="other"/> parts of the Forum , <unk w="the"/> suggestions for <unk w="the"/> <unk w="commission"/> .
A lot of <unk w="people"/> <unk w="is"/> into trying to make sure that <unk w="we"/> felt comfortable enough to <unk w="be"/> strangers and talk honestly about <unk w="the"/> important issues <unk w="of"/> tobacco control .
A lot of excellent feedback in this area was <unk w="done"/> .
One person wrote that they <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> the conference was very welcoming <unk w="and"/> friendly .
<unk w="all"/> those who stated they did not feel <unk w="guilty"/> , one person said they thought the age range was too <unk w="high"/> , and that some of the <unk w="amendments"/> were not appropriate for some <unk w="of"/> the older young adults .
97% of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="has"/> turned in their forms said that <unk w="they"/> <unk w="and"/> their voice was heard , <unk w="and"/> several <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> stated that more discussion in the <unk w="commission"/> could have taken <unk w="place"/> .
<unk w="one"/> of <unk w="the"/> thought <unk w=","/> <unk w="it"/> was respected ( <unk w="the"/> didn't answer , so only 2% of people thought their voice wasn't respected . )
Another person said <unk w="just"/> now <unk w=":"/> a " better understanding of what tobacco awareness <unk w="is"/> " and <unk w="the"/> person , <unk w="after"/> listening <unk w="to"/> Simon Jackson 's keynote speech , said they <unk w="have"/> a <unk w="word"/> about <unk w="that"/> one <unk w="we"/> can keep pushing themselves until they make a <unk w="start"/> .
Many people <unk w="have"/> said that they gained a new awareness and appreciation for all of the energy <unk w="market"/> time that is being put into tobacco control <unk w="in"/> the country .
<unk w="these"/> forms collected each day also <unk w="has"/> the opportunity for participants <unk w="to"/> share their passions about tobacco control .
A <unk w="number"/> of people spoke about making sure that young <unk w="people"/> didn't start smoking , while <unk w="we"/> <unk w="have"/> to make sure that tobacco use was denormalized through <unk w="information"/> about all <unk w="sorts"/> of tobacco and <unk w="land"/> use , including the traditional uses of tobacco .
The evaluation forms asked people to write about what they <unk w="can"/> <unk w="going"/> <unk w="to"/> see happen differently at future events .
64 people in total provided an <unk w="agreement"/> , and many <unk w="new"/> ideas came out <unk w="of"/> these responses .
Some <unk w="speakers"/> suggested they would like to have seen the <unk w="right"/> <unk w="any"/> longer , so there would have been more time to <unk w="come"/> to more workshop sessions , and more chances to explore the city of Ottawa .
Other <unk w="things"/> <unk w="is"/> that <unk w="i"/> would like to have seen more discussion time scheduled <unk w="for"/> the program .
It 's great to hear <unk w="the"/> <unk w="some"/> of the statistics , information and initiatives that are <unk w="available"/> <unk w="by"/> other communities , <unk w="and"/> it <unk w="would"/> have been even better if <unk w="we"/> were <unk w="even"/> more time to talk <unk w="about"/> <unk w="the"/> other <unk w="than"/> what they themselves are doing , and what 's <unk w="countries"/> where <unk w="we"/> live .
People also commented that there should have been more opportunities to receive training on how to help a person 's <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> quit smoking , support them in creating smoke-free spaces , <unk w="in"/> <unk w="the"/> other area <unk w="of"/> tobacco control they were involved in .
Having a showcase of some <unk w="extent"/> <unk w="it"/> is something that a <unk w="group"/> of people <unk w="is"/> <unk w="fleeing"/> from , and for future events it is recommended that <unk w="there"/> be more opportunities in the program for <unk w="access"/> to <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
It was <unk w="clear"/> that in <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="of"/> this , a person has to keep up with young people , <unk w="equally"/> connected with them , <unk w="to"/> keep <unk w="people"/> engaged <unk w="in"/> <unk w="the"/> models for their peers .
Some <unk w="people"/> were having issues with the age range of participants , saying that it was <unk w="the"/> " vast " , and <unk w="that"/> <unk w="it"/> would have been better to invite people <unk w="who"/> were in the same age group ( for example <unk w=")"/> , or 24-29 ) .
Targeting a <unk w="few"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="that"/> could have prevented many of the feelings of disrespect that occurred over the weekend caused by some of the guidelines enforced by conference planners .
Several people thought that <unk w="the"/> <unk w="report"/> was too much to <unk w="do"/> <unk w="to"/> the older participants .
Guidelines were set to keep people accountable and make <unk w="sure"/> that things were fair , however it was obvious that some people weren't happy with them .
In response to <unk w="the"/> tension , one younger <unk w="or"/> wrote that they were <unk w="told"/> that <unk w="they"/> <unk w="and"/> the older people had issues with the policy of equality at the conference .
<unk w="a"/> young person thought it was important to " level <unk w="of"/> playing field " for everyone because <unk w="turkey"/> 's where equality really begins .
One <unk w="wants"/> to solve this issue <unk w="is"/> to have <unk w="more"/> than <unk w="a"/> stream <unk w="of"/> the conference , <unk w="and"/> those aged 16-21 <unk w="the"/> <unk w="socialist"/> group and those young adults <unk w="from"/> <unk w="have"/> 22-29 <unk w="in"/> another .
The evaluation <unk w="has"/> also asked participants to share their most important pieces of <unk w="work"/> , and many <unk w="people"/> eager to give it .
One participant said <unk w=":"/> this sort of event should happen every couple of years so that people could gain " unity " and " enthusiasm " on tobacco <unk w="""/> <unk w="""/> .
<unk w="it"/> <unk w="have"/> said that people <unk w="have"/> to <unk w="make"/> sure that the <unk w="legal"/> Framework is <unk w="concerned"/> , and though they didn't <unk w="the"/> <unk w="it"/> needs to <unk w="do"/> it , <unk w="it"/> 's clear that everyone <unk w="can"/> cares about tobacco control should take part in making <unk w="sure"/> that <unk w="what"/> is happening .
Another <unk w="bill"/> wrote that they felt " inspired " <unk w="to"/> take <unk w="place"/> at home , while someone else said <unk w="about"/> it <unk w="is"/> interesting to see the " <unk w="good"/> " of the ideas on tobacco control from <unk w="outside"/> the country .
Many participants said <unk w="that"/> they <unk w="are"/> happy to meet so many great people , and that <unk w="the"/> opportunity <unk w="to"/> network with others was one of <unk w="the"/> best parts of the conference .
<unk w="however"/> , it was <unk w="said"/> that <unk w="the"/> participants from across <unk w="the"/> country <unk w=","/> <unk w="the"/> Forum was a great idea <unk w=","/> <unk w="because"/> it <unk w="is"/> <unk w="be"/> a <unk w="political"/> event .
Most of the <unk w="amendments"/> <unk w="of"/> the Forum were about the different <unk w="interests"/> of the participants and the workshops not being interactive enough , or long enough to support good discussion .
There were <unk w="some"/> excellent suggestions <unk w="to"/> <unk w="the"/> participants in their evaluation <unk w="and"/> to solve these <unk w="problems"/> at future events .
<unk w="but"/> the best <unk w="outcome"/> of a conference <unk w="is"/> being <unk w="told"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="and"/> other amazing people who share <unk w="the"/> same interests <unk w="to"/> you .
<unk w="parliament"/> 's rewarding to know <unk w="that"/> you're not the only one <unk w="is"/> for something , <unk w="or"/> even <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="to"/> gather new ideas from people while having the opportunity <unk w="to"/> share a few of your <unk w="comments"/> .
People <unk w="are"/> all <unk w="in"/> the country <unk w="leading"/> to Ottawa to meet one another , learn about tobacco <unk w="safety"/> issues and talk <unk w="of"/> <unk w="new"/> ideas , <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and hopes for the <unk w="future"/> .
It is easy <unk w="to"/> forget <unk w="how"/> much each participant brings <unk w="about"/> an event , but much of the success of <unk w="this"/> Forum is linked <unk w="to"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> fact that <unk w="young"/> people <unk w="have"/> attended were so excited about being there .
The success <unk w="of"/> the conference showed <unk w="that"/> together <unk w="we"/> can build on our experiences and apply <unk w="if"/> we learn to inspire others <unk w="to"/> tackle tobacco <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> in their <unk w="camps"/> .
This factsheet provides a brief introduction to appropriate uses of the Dietary Reference Intakes ( DRIs ) for dietary <unk w="policy"/> and planning .
It does not include sufficient detail needed for the competent application <unk w="of"/> the DRIs .
Nutrition and health professionals <unk w="must"/> consult the resources listed <unk w="in"/> <unk w="the"/> section , <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> of <unk w="the"/> DRIs in Community Nutrition and Dietetic Practice .
Understanding the background , the <unk w="social"/> indicators of nutritional <unk w="and"/> upon which the DRIs <unk w="are"/> based , the statistical underpinnings for the <unk w="future"/> <unk w="phases"/> of the DRI values , and the difference between use with individuals and groups is critical for <unk w="the"/> appropriate application of <unk w="the"/> DRIs .
<unk w="the"/> Dietary Reference Intakes ( DRIs ) are nutrient reference values that replace <unk w="the"/> 1990 Recommended Nutrient <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> ( RNIs ) in Canada and <unk w="the"/> 1989 <unk w=","/> Dietary Allowances in the <unk w="member"/> States .
The DRIs are <unk w="not"/> <unk w="to"/> an expanded concept that <unk w="carries"/> functional indicators of good health and prevention of chronic disease , <unk w="as"/> well as adverse <unk w="effects"/> <unk w="resulting"/> from excessive nutrient <unk w="consumption"/> .
As was <unk w="the"/> case with the <unk w="rapporteur"/> , <unk w="this"/> type of DRI <unk w="relating"/> to the <unk w="recommended"/> daily nutrient intake <unk w="of"/> healthy individuals over time .
<unk w="the"/> introduction of the DRIs , especially <unk w="an"/> Estimated <unk w="that"/> Requirement ( EAR ) <unk w="in"/> the Tolerable <unk w="/"/> Intake Level ( UL ) , provides better <unk w="opportunities"/> for use <unk w=","/> dietary assessment and planning for individuals <unk w="and"/> for groups .
The DRIs <unk w="has"/> developed anticipating a variety of uses such <unk w="as"/> :
design and evaluation of diets in a <unk w="of"/> of <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> ;
creation <unk w="of"/> nutrition guidelines and <unk w="""/> <unk w="""/> ;
development of regulations <unk w="on"/> the nutritional quality of the <unk w="food"/> supply .
The figure below <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> <unk w="are"/> among the <unk w="different"/> types of <unk w="the"/> Reference Intakes .
The <unk w="fact"/> that follows summarizes the DRI definitions and the <unk w="clearly"/> illustrated <unk w="by"/> the <unk w="situation"/> .
<unk w="the"/> TABLE : DRI Definitions and Relationship <unk w="of"/> Risk <unk w=","/> <unk w="assessment"/> and Risk of Adverse <unk w="effects"/>
The Dietary <unk w="of"/> <unk w="com"/> ( DRIs ) are established by the National Academy of Sciences , <unk w="there"/> is a private , <unk w="a"/> society of <unk w="the"/> scholars <unk w=","/> a mandate to advise <unk w="the"/> US <unk w="back"/> on scientific and <unk w="political"/> <unk w="report"/> .
Health Canada supports the DRI process and will be using <unk w="its"/> new values in its programs and policies .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w="it"/> will influence <unk w="the"/> development of regulatory standards , <unk w="because"/> of dietary patterns , and the <unk w="problem"/> of food and nutrition advice delivered to the Canadian public .
<unk w="but"/> Canada has an internal working group <unk w="in"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> from the different bureaus working with the DRI .
This group guides the <unk w="view"/> that Health Canada is <unk w="trying"/> to <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> DRIs to ensure consistency in their use and application <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="legislation"/> .
<unk w="elections"/> were held in June 1998 with Canadian stakeholders , including representatives of <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and <unk w="state"/> governments , non-governmental organizations , <unk w="in"/> the food and supplement industry , to discuss <unk w="cod"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="as"/> a rational and <unk w="transparent"/> process for the implementation of <unk w="the"/> DRIs in Canada .
<unk w="yesterday"/> on comments received from these stakeholders , Health Canada assembled an <unk w="independent"/> Advisory Committee <unk w="and"/> Dietary Reference Intakes in September <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> .
The role of this Committee is to provide <unk w="parliament"/> and informed feedback on the <unk w="part"/> of <unk w="the"/> DRIs <unk w="and"/> public <unk w="health"/> and advise <unk w="the"/> potential intervention options <unk w="offered"/> by Health <unk w="care"/> .
Options could <unk w="bring"/> changes to dietary guidance , policies related to the food supply , <unk w="the"/> targeted education .
The reports of the Subcommittee <unk w="of"/> Interpretation and <unk w="that"/> of Dietary Reference Intakes provide <unk w="for"/> <unk w="for"/> <unk w="for"/> nutrition practitioners using the DRIs :
Each report presents the theoretical <unk w="basis"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="and"/> for the various uses of the <unk w="common"/> values , presents sample applications , and <unk w="the"/> guidelines to help professionals determine <unk w="what"/> specific uses would be inappropriate .
<unk w="all"/> of Canada has developed a professional education program for nutrition and <unk w="training"/> professionals to learn about <unk w="this"/> , the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="are"/> , and how to use them <unk w="as"/> <unk w="best"/> practice .
To help health professionals understand the DRIs , articles are also <unk w="being"/> <unk w=","/> in scientific <unk w="terms"/> .
Cornell University <unk w=","/> compiled a list of some of the available <unk w="in"/> articles .
For a more detailed list , conduct a search of PubMed ( the search service of the U.S. <unk w="("/> <unk w="fees"/> of Medicine ) .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w="some"/> of the DRIs fall into two broad categories : assessment and planning .
Dietary <unk w="this"/> involves a <unk w="series"/> of usual nutrient intakes with nutrient requirements , and examines the probability of inadequate or excessive <unk w="training"/> .
<unk w="regional"/> planning aims to <unk w="the"/> usual diets that have an acceptably <unk w="outermost"/> <unk w="assessment"/> of nutrient inadequacy or excess .
Clearly , <unk w="these"/> two general applications are interrelated .
<unk w="in"/> most situations , planning <unk w="of"/> <unk w="an"/> ongoing activity in <unk w="which"/> planners set goals for usual intake , assess whether the goals are achieved <unk w=","/> then <unk w="withdrawing"/> their planning procedures accordingly .
Dietary assessment and dietary planning can <unk w="be"/> conducted <unk w="by"/> <unk w="the"/> individual or for a group .
The methods and the appropriate <unk w="added"/> value to use differ in each case .
The following chart provides a summary <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> uses of the DRIs but lacks <unk w="the"/> detail needed for <unk w="the"/> correct application .
It is also important <unk w="to"/> note <unk w="that"/> <unk w="there"/> are standards for apparently healthy people , and <unk w="this"/> meant <unk w="to"/> <unk w="be"/> applied to those <unk w="of"/> <unk w="infected"/> or chronic disease or for repletion of previously deficient individuals .

accurate <unk w="assessment"/> of <unk w="the"/> usual ( long-term ) intake <unk w="in"/> the individual or group
-the number of days needed to accurately assess usual intake differs among nutrients , <unk w="as"/> well as among <unk w="others"/> or groups
<unk w="this"/> requirement ( s ) of the individual or group
-requirement is the lowest <unk w="recommended"/> intake level of a nutrient that , for a <unk w="good"/> indicator of <unk w="this"/> , <unk w="to"/> <unk w="on"/> a defined level of nutritional adequacy
For <unk w="example"/> , a usual intake well below the <unk w="medium"/> or AI would <unk w="be"/> a reason to further assess the individual 's <unk w="legal"/> status <unk w="by"/> laboratory testing or clinical examination .
Individuals whose usual intake exceeds the UL may <unk w="be"/> at risk of adverse health effects .
Assessment of <unk w="the"/> adequacy <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> individual is difficult <unk w="because"/> of the imprecision involved in estimating <unk w="the"/> <unk w="kinnock"/> 's <unk w="daily"/> intake and the lack of <unk w="freedom"/> of an individual <unk w="national"/> requirement .
The individual 's true usual intake and true requirements must <unk w="be"/> <unk w="defined"/> .
Thus , assessment of dietary adequacy <unk w="of"/> an individual must be interpreted cautiously <unk w="and"/> <unk w=","/> with other types of information about the individual .
Dietary assessment of groups ( for example , a population survey ) can provide information on the prevalence of nutrient inadequacy and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of <unk w="such"/> excess .
<unk w="we"/> may also study <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of smaller <unk w="companies"/> with common characteristics to determine whether <unk w="the"/> intakes are adequate or whether there is a proportion of the group at risk for adverse health effects .
<unk w="in"/> the diets of groups can be <unk w="used"/> to develop food and nutrition policy and <unk w="it"/> <unk w="would"/> be useful in determining whether food and nutrition programs are effective .
Depending <unk w="on"/> the results <unk w="of"/> the assessment , intervention strategies might <unk w="also"/> <unk w="going"/> to address any problem <unk w="too"/> .
Dietary assessment <unk w="of"/> the group <unk w="of"/> <unk w="is"/> <unk w="and"/> comparing usual nutrient <unk w=","/> with nutrient <unk w=","/> to assess the prevalence of inadequacy <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="commission"/> .
the probability approach , which involves determining <unk w="the"/> risk of inadequacy to each individual in <unk w="the"/> group and summing the <unk w="community"/> ( weighted average of the risk of <unk w="work"/> )
<unk w="the"/> EAR cut-point method , a <unk w="modern"/> version of the probability approach that can <unk w="be"/> used <unk w="if"/> specific conditions are <unk w="needed"/> , <unk w="and"/> approximate the proportion of the <unk w="population"/> with intakes below requirements
<unk w="this"/> RDA should not be used as a cut-point for assessing <unk w="the"/> <unk w="number"/> of groups because a serious <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of <unk w="the"/> proportion of <unk w="our"/> group at risk of inadequacy would <unk w="be"/> .
For <unk w=","/> with an AI , <unk w="the"/> best that can be done is <unk w="to"/> look at mean and median intake relative <unk w="to"/> the AI .
When the AI has been set based on <unk w="the"/> mean intake of a healthy <unk w="state"/> , <unk w="a"/> <unk w=","/> with <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> at or above the AI can <unk w="be"/> <unk w="it"/> to <unk w="be"/> adequate .
When the AI has <unk w="been"/> experimentally derived or developed <unk w="by"/> a combination of experimental <unk w="and"/> intake data , there is less confidence in <unk w="the"/> assessment .
When mean intakes of <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> are below the AI , <unk w="it"/> can be inferred about the adequacy of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="verheugen"/> 's intake .
The UL can be used as a cut-point against <unk w="it"/> to <unk w="the"/> usual intakes in order to estimate the proportion of a <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> at potential risk of adverse <unk w="effects"/> from excessive intake of a nutrient .
<unk w="the"/> diets are being planned for individuals or for groups , the <unk w="commission"/> is to plan usual <unk w=","/> that are nutritionally <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> ( such <unk w="as"/> the probability of nutrient inadequacy or excess is <unk w="very"/> low ) .
For individuals , the goal <unk w="of"/> planning is to <unk w="the"/> usual intakes that are close to the RDA or the <unk w="commission"/> .
For groups , the <unk w="commission"/> is to determine a usual intake <unk w="of"/> that results in a low prevalence of intakes that are inadequate or <unk w="the"/> <unk w="risk"/> of being excessive .
When using the DRIs for <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> individuals or for groups , it <unk w="is"/> helpful to consider the process and functional <unk w="political"/> <unk w="measures"/> for developing the DRIs for specific nutrients .
Special considerations <unk w="are"/> planning <unk w="availability"/> <unk w="measures"/> that affect nutrient bioavailability , such as <unk w="the"/> source , chemical form and <unk w="other"/> matrix , <unk w="as"/> well as <unk w="the"/> physiological , lifestyle <unk w="and"/> health factors that may alter nutrient <unk w="and"/> <unk w="is"/> therefore recommended <unk w="it"/> .
The goal of planning <unk w="tools"/> for individuals is to <unk w="be"/> a low probability of inadequacy while minimizing potential risk of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> nutrient .
Food-based nutrition education tools , such <unk w="as"/> <unk w="children"/> 's Food Guide <unk w="to"/> <unk w="the"/> Eating , <unk w="are"/> often used to <unk w="be"/> an individual plan a healthy diet .
The <unk w="commission"/> <unk w="policy"/> planning <unk w="for"/> groups <unk w="were"/> to <unk w="have"/> a <unk w="series"/> of usual <unk w="the"/> intakes that provides for a low prevalence of inadequate intakes and a low prevalence of intakes that may be at potential <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of adverse effects due <unk w="to"/> excessive intake .
To <unk w="achieve"/> this , an acceptable <unk w="percentage"/> of inadequacy must be defined and the distribution of usual intakes in the group <unk w="cannot"/> be estimated .
The procedure used for planning intakes of groups differs depending on whether the group is relatively homogeneous or is composed of a number of <unk w="countries"/> that differ <unk w="from"/> nutrient <unk w="and"/> energy <unk w="policy"/> .
<unk w="the"/> most <unk w="importantly"/> , <unk w="the"/> diets for <unk w="example"/> is an <unk w="excellent"/> endeavour <unk w="in"/> which dietary intakes are planned , intakes <unk w="be"/> assessed to judge <unk w="the"/> success of <unk w="regional"/> planning activity , and planning efforts are modified <unk w="properly"/> .

Inuit and governments work together to address challenges <unk w="and"/> Inuit <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> <unk w="today"/>
OTTAWA - The first <unk w="priority"/> Inuit Health Policy Forum begins today in Ottawa .
The forum , co-sponsored by <unk w="the"/> Inuit Tapirisat of Canada ( ITC ) and <unk w="in"/> Canada , brings <unk w="me"/> from across <unk w="europe"/> together with officials from federal , provincial , territorial and regional <unk w="charges"/> to <unk w="achieve"/> <unk w="the"/> current and emerging issues in Inuit health <unk w="problems"/> .
The Government of Canada recognizes <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> the <unk w="public"/> health challenges faced <unk w="by"/> Inuit require solutions specific to <unk w="us"/> .
It is important to consider Inuit health care <unk w="in"/> <unk w="the"/> context of factors intrinsic to Inuit communities , <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> geography , culture , language and diet .
Okalik Eegeesiak , President <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> ITC , says , " This is another <unk w="important"/> step <unk w="in"/> our <unk w="relationship"/> with the Government of Canada .
Rather <unk w="than"/> just being <unk w="accused"/> of federal programs , Inuit are working with the government <unk w="of"/> <unk w="s"/> programs and policies that better reflect the realities of our <unk w="citizens"/> and our <unk w="citizens"/> . "
More than 100 delegates will spend the next two days gaining an understanding of <unk w="the"/> health policy issues and priorities , as well <unk w="as"/> government <unk w="'s"/> policy processes .
Partnership relations will be strengthened <unk w="by"/> shared experiences drawing on <unk w="many"/> examples from initiatives such <unk w="a"/> Department of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada / Inuit Tapirisat of Canada <unk w="'"/> Action Plan process , and Health Canada 's First Nations and Inuit Home <unk w="of"/> Community Care Program .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w="we"/> <unk w="to"/> assist Inuit and <unk w="the"/> participants in learning , exchanging ideas and planning <unk w="for"/> ways of working together with a goal <unk w="of"/> developing <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> and <unk w="room"/> for greater <unk w="eu"/> involvement in health <unk w="safety"/> issues .

** Taken from Overview <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> Natural Health Products <unk w="""/> ( November 2003 )
The New Substances Assessment and Control Bureau ( NSACB ) is responsible for the pre-manufacture <unk w="and"/> <unk w="the"/> assessment <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="possible"/> health risks <unk w="of"/> the general population associated with new chemical substances such <unk w="as"/> fabric dyes <unk w="the"/> fuel <unk w="production"/> , as well as <unk w="that"/> of <unk w="measures"/> such as micro-organisms used in reclaiming land after an oil spill .
For new substances <unk w=","/> by <unk w="the"/> Food <unk w="chain"/> <unk w="to"/> Act ( F&DA ) , <unk w="on"/> the environmental impact and risks to <unk w="public"/> health through environmental exposure to these substances are assessed within the Bureau .
This work is carried <unk w="out"/> to ensure <unk w="that"/> no new <unk w="law"/> is introduced into Canada on a commercial <unk w="basis"/> before it has been evaluated for <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> risks <unk w="to"/> human health and <unk w="the"/> environment .
Some substances are reviewed at the <unk w="time"/> and development stage .
This proactive approach <unk w="to"/> managing risks of new <unk w="information"/> is <unk w="one"/> of the key objectives <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> Canadian Environmental Protection Act ( CEPA ) .
<unk w="such"/> a <unk w="report"/> is identified , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="has"/> taken to reduce the risk by <unk w="eta"/> or even banning the substance or product .

Canada 's Drug <unk w="federations"/> - Straight <unk w="away"/> About Drugs <unk w="and"/> Drug Abuse
Drug use <unk w="is"/> a problem when use of a <unk w="concrete"/> results <unk w="and"/> negative consequences for the person who uses the drug .
These may be physical , mental , <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , emotional , legal , economic or environmental consequences .
When a person continues <unk w="to"/> use a drug despite negative consequences to him or herself or to <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> <unk w="from"/> such <unk w="a"/> family , friends or employer , this use is often <unk w="not"/> referred to as drug or substance abuse .
Other terms used <unk w="to"/> describe drug use associated <unk w="with"/> negative consequences include " misuse " , " <unk w="the"/> " and " addiction " .
As well as being used informally <unk w="to"/> describe the negative consequences of <unk w="their"/> use , the terms " abuse " <unk w="and"/> " <unk w="and"/> " are also used by <unk w="terrorism"/> in classifying substance-related <unk w="and"/> , e.g. , drug dependence , alcohol abuse .
" Drug or substance misuse " is <unk w="a"/> <unk w="possible"/> to describe drug problems that are less serious or <unk w="coherent"/> or , in some cases , inadvertent , <unk w="and"/> as <unk w="not"/> complying with <unk w="the"/> medication instructions .
When used informally , " dependence " refers <unk w="to"/> when a person <unk w="who"/> uses <unk w="or"/> feels unable to function without taking the <unk w="lead"/> .
Dependence includes continued <unk w="account"/> of the drug despite <unk w="the"/> consequences and usually , but not always , the presence of tolerance <unk w="in"/> <unk w="the"/> symptoms .
Although the <unk w="word"/> " addiction " is no <unk w="longer"/> <unk w=","/> as a medical diagnosis , it is still <unk w="very"/> <unk w="possible"/> to describe a range of compulsive behaviours , including <unk w="the"/> abuse and gambling <unk w="""/> .
<unk w="it"/> is also often used to describe specialized <unk w="species"/> ( as <unk w="well"/> as related <unk w="to"/> and activities ) for people with drug abuse problems .
Drug abuse <unk w="will"/> result in <unk w="the"/> risk of health problems such as illness , <unk w="psychological"/> and physical damage to the body or death .
Drug abuse <unk w="will"/> result in personal problems such as loss <unk w="of"/> motivation , or physical and / or <unk w="on"/> dependence , problems <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> work or school .
Drug abuse can result in <unk w="serious"/> problems like strained and unhappy family relationships and family breakdown .
Drug abuse <unk w="will"/> contribute to social problems <unk w=","/> <unk w="organised"/> crime and traffic crashes .
Drug <unk w="addiction"/> can also result <unk w="from"/> <unk w="the"/> costs to society for things <unk w="like"/> health care , crime or <unk w="higher"/> productivity .
( See section on <unk w="the"/> Costs <unk w="of"/> Substance <unk w="enormously"/> in Canada in Appendix . )
Sometimes even the use of a drug for medicinal purposes can cause <unk w="problems"/> .
These problems may occur because <unk w="the"/> side effects from the medication , or because <unk w="of"/> drug <unk w="is"/> used for too <unk w="long"/> , <unk w="is"/> the wrong <unk w="way"/> or <unk w="if"/> the person does not use it as <unk w="well"/> .
Drug problems can <unk w=","/> for a variety of reasons and from use of any type <unk w="of"/> drug .
Use of a <unk w="solution"/> can cause a problem if too <unk w=","/> of the <unk w="disease"/> is taken at one time or <unk w="that"/> <unk w="that"/> drug is taken <unk w="too"/> frequently .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w="this"/> may include immediate <unk w="issues"/> such as unpleasant <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> or even a harmful or fatal overdose .
Other problems may take some time <unk w="to"/> develop , <unk w="such"/> as needing more of the drug <unk w="can"/> achieve the same effect and becoming <unk w="focused"/> on <unk w="the"/> drug .
Some <unk w="member"/> <unk w="we"/> can have a beneficial effect if taken at the correct <unk w="time"/> for that person , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="is"/> <unk w=","/> if too <unk w=","/> a dose of the drug is taken or if the drug <unk w="is"/> used more frequently <unk w="is"/> prescribed .
A drug can <unk w="cause"/> problems <unk w="and"/> it <unk w="has"/> taken <unk w="up"/> for a long period <unk w="of"/> time .
<unk w="the"/> medicinal <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> killers , as well as drugs <unk w=","/> to aid sleep or reduce anxiety , <unk w="which"/> cause problems if they are taken after they are no longer needed .
<unk w="for"/> instance , people who use drugs may have difficulty stopping use of the drug because they <unk w="have"/> become dependent on it .
A drug <unk w="may"/> cause <unk w="problems"/> if it is taken for the <unk w="same"/> reason .
A common example is using alcohol as a <unk w="result"/> of coping with <unk w="their"/> feelings , <unk w="rather"/> than drinking as <unk w="part"/> of a social or celebratory occasion .
Taking <unk w="this"/> <unk w="focusing"/> <unk w="special"/> attention to label <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="it"/> can also lead to serious problems , <unk w="particularly"/> <unk w=","/> drugs <unk w="and"/> <unk w=","/> impair <unk w="environmental"/> performance and <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="could"/> not be mixed with alcohol .
Also , taking less than the <unk w="lowest"/> dose <unk w=","/> a <unk w="country"/> or <unk w="in"/> its use too <unk w=","/> can result in problems .
A drug can cause problems if it is <unk w="not"/> <unk w="to"/> combination-either knowingly or unknowingly- with certain <unk w="other"/> <unk w="areas"/> .
Some combinations can <unk w="be"/> unwanted and <unk w="there"/> effects .
Using alcohol <unk w="and"/> a benzodiazepine increases the <unk w="risk"/> that the person who <unk w="has"/> the drugs <unk w="could"/> feel increased effects such as <unk w="noise"/> , <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="etc"/> .
Other combinations , like barbiturates with alcohol , can cause <unk w="us"/> .
These drugs <unk w="could"/> cause serious problems no matter how or when they are taken .
With such drugs there is no difference between use <unk w="and"/> abuse .
<unk w="it"/> is <unk w="the"/> most commonly used psychoactive drug <unk w="in"/> our society .
<unk w="unfortunately"/> , alcohol <unk w="and"/> <unk w=","/> are the most widely abused drugs by both young people and adults .
Abuse of <unk w="these"/> two drugs <unk w="are"/> in enormous costs to both the individual <unk w="countries"/> who uses drugs and society .
Among <unk w="others"/> , those <unk w="who"/> begin <unk w="by"/> <unk w="the"/> adolescents often <unk w=","/> regular , lifelong smokers .
Smoking and heavy drinking are major <unk w="types"/> of health problems and premature <unk w=","/> among Canadians , and they result in <unk w="the"/> costs to both the individual <unk w="member"/> <unk w="states"/> .
Illegal <unk w="immigration"/> of drugs is more common <unk w="to"/> adolescents and <unk w="more"/> <unk w="more"/> than <unk w="the"/> age groups .
Several <unk w="people"/> have found that as <unk w="the"/> youth <unk w="is"/> using <unk w="terrorism"/> in <unk w="the"/> past year as <unk w="well"/> .
In <unk w="fact"/> , use of medication to aid sleep or reduce <unk w="what"/> is more common among seniors than other age groups .

OTTAWA - The Canadian <unk w="inspectors"/> and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="character"/> ( CFAS ) has now issued <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> 2000 <unk w="percent"/> for Therapeutic Donor Insemination ( TDI ) , which replace the previous <unk w="report"/> <unk w=","/> as referenced <unk w="as"/> the <unk w="production"/> and Distribution of Semen for Assisted Conception Regulations <unk w="in"/> the Food and Drugs Act .
<unk w="article"/> 2000 <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> contain <unk w="any"/> changes , including expanded criteria <unk w=","/> donor screening and <unk w="the"/> testing <unk w="of"/> <unk w="they"/> reflect technological <unk w="progress"/> in the area of <unk w="its"/> conception .
The change which most <unk w="clearly"/> affects the status <unk w="of"/> donor semen <unk w="and"/> the inclusion of the Nucleic Acid Amplification Test ( NAT ) as <unk w="the"/> sole acceptable test <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> chlamydia , due to its unprecedented accuracy in detecting the infection .
As a relatively new test , <unk w="it"/> was not required in the past , and <unk w="it"/> was <unk w="not"/> used by most <unk w="european"/> banks .
<unk w="however"/> , most <unk w="of"/> the regular <unk w="basis"/> of semen , including <unk w="the"/> semen originally placed <unk w="in"/> detention <unk w=","/> Health <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> investigations last summer , <unk w="as"/> well as semen currently being processed , <unk w="does"/> not meet the CFAS 2000 Guidelines and will be detained .
New semen <unk w="are"/> , <unk w="together"/> with the 2000 Guidelines , <unk w="will"/> be <unk w="made"/> for use <unk w="of"/> assisted conception after the standard six-month quarantine period .
Health Canada recognizes that these <unk w="amendments"/> <unk w="will"/> result in a significant waiting <unk w="rate"/> for many Canadians who choose to use therapeutic donor insemination <unk w="and"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="in"/> their <unk w="homes"/> .
However , ultimately , <unk w="in"/> Canada <unk w="has"/> <unk w="not"/> <unk w="trying"/> to protect <unk w="the"/> health <unk w="and"/> <unk w=","/> of all <unk w="citizens"/> , and the <unk w="above"/> 2000 Guidelines reflect that commitment by incorporating the best , most modern <unk w="way"/> for securing the <unk w="future"/> <unk w="of"/> donor semen in Canada .
<unk w="while"/> Canada is putting forward regulatory <unk w="proposals"/> to the Semen Regulations .
As part <unk w="of"/> these amendments to <unk w="the"/> Semen Regulations , a provision is <unk w="being"/> proposed that will allow , <unk w="under"/> <unk w="market"/> conditions , special <unk w="measures"/> to banked <unk w="the"/> semen that would otherwise be unavailable .
It is <unk w="clear"/> that <unk w="this"/> proposal will be <unk w="the"/> <unk w="to"/> Fall <unk w="victim"/> .
Health Canada is committed <unk w="to"/> ensuring the health and safety of assisted <unk w="people"/> in Canada .
As the regulator , Health Canada will continue to enforce a high standard for the TDI industry with <unk w="the"/> on-site inspections .
Between May and July 2000 , Health Canada 's Bureau of Compliance and Enforcement <unk w="of"/> conduct on-site <unk w=","/> at all semen banks , as a follow up to last summer 's investigation .

A predictable <unk w="enquiry"/> makes Nutrition Facts easier <unk w="to"/> find and use .
<unk w="we"/> are familiar with nutrient content claims such as " high fibre " and " low sodium " .
The new regulations would specify the exact conditions for a food to <unk w="pay"/> for a claim .
These messages reinforce the <unk w="availability"/> of healthy eating as part <unk w="of"/> a lifestyle that <unk w="would"/> reduce the risk of developing a chronic disease , such as heart disease or cancer .
When a claim is made , consumers <unk w="must"/> be able <unk w="to"/> look at the <unk w="alleged"/> Facts box to get <unk w="the"/> <unk w="bigger"/> picture .
The <unk w="commission"/> <unk w="is"/> , in collaboration with the Department of Justice and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="pharmaceutical"/> Products and Food Branch program areas , provides <unk w="caution"/> , <unk w="particularly"/> <unk w=","/> coordination <unk w=","/> managing litigation and legal risks related to <unk w="the"/> activities of the Health Products and Food Branch .
Let <unk w="me"/> first commend all of the Canadians that have made contributions and donations to this very important undertaking right across <unk w="the"/> world .
<unk w="as"/> <unk w="we"/> know , <unk w="the"/> Public <unk w="health"/> Agency of Canada is <unk w="currently"/> focused <unk w="on"/> working with international agencies <unk w="such"/> as the <unk w="main"/> <unk w="of"/> Organization and the <unk w="member"/> <unk w=","/> to determine what types of <unk w="financial"/> assistance <unk w="is"/> <unk w="to"/> provide to <unk w="improve"/> their efforts .
<unk w="in"/> particular , we are working <unk w="together"/> to <unk w="the"/> links <unk w="with"/> Canadian health care professionals with <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> skill sets <unk w="out"/> international medical agencies , such as <unk w="those"/> WHO <unk w="are"/> Médecins Sans Frontières .
Health <unk w="care"/> , the <unk w="world"/> Health Agency and the Canadian <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> Development Agency are also working together with NGOs and international organizations to identify the need for specific medicines and medical supplies .
In addition , <unk w="the"/> Public Health <unk w="policy"/> is sending <unk w="the"/> public health experts to <unk w="deal"/> with our embassy in <unk w="brussels"/> .
<unk w="we"/> expect to send <unk w="to"/> public health experts depending on the needs <unk w="of"/> the countries <unk w="involved"/> and the work of the WHO .
<unk w="in"/> terms <unk w="of"/> other health professionals who might be required , Médecins Sans <unk w="been"/> has <unk/> teams in the <unk w="what"/> determining <unk/> is needed .
The <unk w="commission"/> will continue <unk w="to"/> <unk w="deal"/> with Médecins Sans Frontières and will solicit volunteers from throughout the country <unk w="the"/> on <unk/> <unk w="they"/> these <unk/> define .
We expect to add to this effort <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="years"/> to come based <unk w="on"/> the needs of the countries involved and the work of the <unk w="commission"/> and the UN .
We anticipate <unk w="that"/> there will be a need for epidemiologists <unk w="as"/> well as <unk w="public"/> health <unk w="prior"/> to <unk w="bring"/> <unk w="and"/> surveillance efforts .
This <unk w="afternoon"/> , <unk w="particularly"/> on <unk w="the"/> ground , will be vital <unk w="for"/> determining <unk w="how"/> additional assistance is <unk w="available"/> .
The Agency <unk w="has"/> been in <unk w="line"/> with several of the provinces and <unk w="those"/> on these <unk w="matters"/> .
These discussions continue and , if <unk w="necessary"/> , the Agency will coordinate with the provinces <unk w="of"/> territories to <unk w="all"/> the expertise required .
The Agency is exploring <unk w="the"/> possibility of sending additional epidemiologists to the region to ensure a robust surveillance <unk w="system"/> in place for all <unk w="animal"/> diseases at this time .
There <unk w="are"/> many other <unk w="things"/> that we're <unk w="dealt"/> with on an ongoing basis and in a coordinated fashion
Progress on <unk w="the"/> First Ministers' September 2000 <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> on health
Two years ago , Canada <unk w="is"/> First <unk w="to"/> <unk w="showed"/> a commitment to collaborate on specific health priorities <unk w="with"/> full respect of each government 's <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
While some initiatives require <unk w="the"/> time to achieve their full effect , the collective <unk w="implementation"/> of the <unk w="union"/> , provincial and territorial governments are resulting in <unk w=","/> on a <unk w="number"/> of key issues .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w="research"/> and lifestyle <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> are a key factor in <unk w="public"/> health and <unk w="safety"/> <unk w="of"/> Canadians .
Health Ministers are developing a pan-Canadian strategy * that will , in partnership with health care providers and <unk w="all"/> stakeholders , promote health and decrease the risk <unk w="of"/> that <unk w="is"/> to <unk w="be"/> .
Federal , provincial <unk w="and"/> territorial governments want to ensure <unk w="that"/> drug prices are fair and <unk w="balanced"/> , that drugs are <unk w="both"/> and <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> and that the <unk w="eu"/> is operating <unk w="there"/> .
The establishment <unk w="of"/> a single , common drug review process to assist jurisdictions in assessing the therapeutic benefits and cost-effectiveness of new drugs considered for coverage by public <unk w="service"/> benefit plans .
<unk w="this"/> <unk w="this"/> <unk w="is"/> a National Prescription Drug Utilization Information System ( NPDUIS ) <unk w="which"/> will provide accurate and timely information and analysis on prescription drug use and costs .
This will <unk w="allow"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="in"/> pharmaceutical management and policy decisions .
It will also support <unk w="fire"/> safety surveillance by identifying the extent of drug use <unk w="of"/> the population .
Health Ministers are set to provide <unk w="alternatives"/> , <unk w="transparent"/> and public reporting to their respective citizens using jointly agreed upon comparable indicators on health status , health <unk w="care"/> and quality of service .
<unk w="this"/> will allow citizens to see how their health system is serving them and help governments identify areas for improvement .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w="they"/> release their <unk w="two"/> reports by September 30 , 2002 .
Important steps are being taken to <unk w="ensure"/> that the necessary medical <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> health personnel are there to meet the present and future health <unk w="warnings"/> of Canadians :
Provinces and territories have moved quickly to increase <unk w="the"/> <unk w="incidence"/> of doctors in Canada , announcing funding for over 300 <unk w="'s"/> entry positions to medical schools and have <unk w="had"/> the opportunities <unk w="for"/> international medical graduates to <unk w="do"/> the work force .
A <unk w="number"/> of jurisdictions are pursuing <unk w="the"/> <unk w="need"/> to <unk w="the"/> medical students <unk w="and"/> residents to work in <unk w="small"/> and remote areas .
<unk w="this"/> work continues on the Nursing Strategy <unk w="of"/> Canada* , whose goal is to achieve and maintain an <unk w="overall"/> supply of nursing <unk w=","/> who are appropriately educated , distributed and deployed <unk w="to"/> meet the health needs of Canadians .
Recognizing that health care personnel need <unk w="the"/> appropriate tools to care for Canadians , <unk w="the"/> Ministers are <unk w="prepared"/> to invest in equipment , <unk w="new"/> technologies <unk w="and"/> facilities .
Since 2000 , more than 40 MRIs , at <unk w="the"/> 58 CT scanners , more <unk w="than"/> 25 nuclear cameras ( used for cardiac and cancer diagnosis ) and approximately 16 linear accelerators ( that are also used in cancer <unk w="uranium"/> ) have been <unk w="subject"/> to health care <unk w="net"/> in provinces and territories .
In <unk w="order"/> to provincial and territorial investments , <unk w="the"/> Government of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="of"/> a $ 1 billion Medical Equipment Fund <unk w="to"/> assist provinces and territories to <unk w="sea"/> and install <unk w="all"/> equipment according to their respective health care priorities .
For <unk w="the"/> Canadians , <unk w="public"/> health <unk w="policy"/> - in physicians' offices , pharmacies , or community health clinics - is their <unk w="most"/> common <unk w="practice"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> health care system .
Improving its <unk w="policy"/> will have a <unk w="real"/> impact , <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> access to care .
<unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and territories are pursuing innovations such as <unk w="existing"/> systems , interdisciplinary teams of <unk w="all"/> <unk w="service"/> providers , and greater emphasis <unk w="on"/> <unk w="the"/> promotion <unk w="of"/> <unk w="clarity"/> and injury prevention .
In <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> provincial and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="president"/> , the Government of Canada established an $ 800 million Primary <unk w="and"/> <unk w="the"/> Transition Fund <unk w="will"/> contribute to the <unk w="implementation"/> of these initiatives .
Governments remain committed to continue to <unk w="support"/> and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="eu"/> 's publicly funded health <unk w=","/> through partnership and collaboration .
While much <unk w="more"/> <unk w="is"/> accomplished <unk w="to"/> date , progress on other <unk w="things"/> will continue in the months and years ahead .
* <unk w="it"/> does not participate in <unk w="any"/> initiatives , but contributes by sharing information and best <unk w="practice"/> .
<unk w="however"/> - The Honourable Anne McLellan , Minister of Health , today launched a national campaign to <unk w="raise"/> awareness of the benefits <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> acid to help <unk w="given"/> birth defects .
The campaign highlights the importance of folic <unk w="trafficking"/> in preventing neural <unk w="from"/> defects .
These birth <unk w="should"/> include abnormalities of the spine , brain <unk w="chemical"/> skull that occur if a part <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="commission"/> fetus called the <unk w="european"/> tube , fails to close <unk w="them"/> in <unk w="the"/> pregnancy .
Spina bifida is the <unk w="most"/> common neural tube defect .
About 260 babies are born in Canada each year <unk w="in"/> a neural tube defect .
" Every child deserves <unk w="a"/> <unk w="to"/> start <unk w="of"/> life , " said Minister McLellan . "
The <unk w="commission"/> <unk w="of"/> this <unk w="information"/> campaign is to provide women <unk w="with"/> the type of information they can use to help prevent birth <unk w="and"/> that <unk w="would"/> result in a lifelong disability . "
The <unk w="proposal"/> includes <unk w="participation"/> in national magazines <unk w="such"/> as Chatelaine , Today 's Parent , Flare , 7 Jours , and Clin d'oeil ; <unk w="and"/> in <unk w="germany"/> , <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and fitness centres ; and information pamphlets directed at women of child-bearing age .
As part of the campaign , Health Canada has <unk w="produced"/> a resource document for <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="and"/> are <unk w="in"/> the position to advise women about pregnancy .
The campaign <unk w="therefore"/> features a Web site with useful links to other sources of <unk w="energy"/> .
Research has shown <unk w="that"/> the risk of babies <unk w="in"/> a <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> <unk w="of"/> defect was reduced when women took a daily vitamin <unk w=","/> containing folic acid <unk w=","/> before conception <unk w="and"/> in the early <unk w="stages"/> <unk w="of"/> pregnancy .
In addition to addressing the use of <unk w="the"/> acid , the campaign also stresses the <unk w="importance"/> of <unk w="animal"/> nutrition .
The five principles of the Canada <unk w="must"/> Act <unk w="on"/> the <unk w="interests"/> <unk w="of"/> the Canadian health care system , and reflect the values that <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> Canada 's single-payer , publicly-financed health care <unk w="sector"/> .
<unk w="mr"/> <unk w="president"/> , passed unanimously by Parliament in 1984 , affirms the federal government 's commitment to a universal , accessible , comprehensive , portable and publicly <unk w="the"/> health insurance system .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w="it"/> aims to ensure that all residents of Canada <unk w="receive"/> access to necessary hospital and physician services on a prepaid basis .
<unk w="the"/> Canada Health Act defines <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and territories the criteria and conditions that they must satisfy <unk w="in"/> order to qualify for their full share of the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> transfers under the <unk w="pre-accession"/> <unk w="of"/> Transfer ( CHT ) cash contribution .
<unk w="good"/> administration : <unk w="the"/> <unk w="protection"/> of the health <unk w="and"/> insurance <unk w=","/> of a province or territory must <unk w="be"/> carried out on a non-profit basis by a public <unk w="debate"/> ;
comprehensiveness : all medically necessary services <unk w="provided"/> by hospitals <unk w="and"/> doctors must <unk w="be"/> <unk w="it"/> ;
universality : all insured persons in the province or territory <unk w="should"/> be entitled <unk w="to"/> public health insurance coverage on <unk w="the"/> terms <unk w="of"/> conditions ;
<unk w="subject"/> : coverage for insured services must be maintained <unk w="that"/> an insured person moves or travels within Canada or travels outside the <unk w="union"/> ; and
accessibility : <unk w="public"/> access <unk w="to"/> insured persons to medically necessary hospital and physician services must <unk w="be"/> unimpeded by <unk w="one"/> or other barriers .
The Canada <unk w="must"/> Act also <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> that ban extra-billing and user <unk w="products"/> :
no user charges for insured health services by hospitals or other providers under the <unk w="framework"/> of the health care insurance plan of the <unk w="environment"/> or <unk w="consumers"/> .
Under the Canada Health Act , the federal <unk w="republic"/> of Health is required <unk w="to"/> provide information on the <unk w="use"/> of provincial and territorial <unk w="health"/> care plans <unk w="if"/> they relate to the criteria and conditions of the Act .
<unk w="our"/> approach to this information gathering has <unk w="been"/> collaborative , where provinces , territories <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="irish"/> government <unk w="has"/> worked <unk w="together"/> to supply the information <unk w="available"/> <unk w="by"/> the Minister .
<unk w="books"/> contained in this website , some of which was <unk w="made"/> <unk w="as"/> a result of this annual reporting process , has <unk w="been"/> organized as follows :
The Overview provides an overview of the Canada Health Act and the associated regulations <unk w="and"/> <unk w="measures"/> that are used in the administration of the Act ;
Administration reviews the administration <unk w="of"/> the Canada Health Act <unk w="and"/> 2003-2004 , <unk w="which"/> includes a summary <unk w="of"/> compliance issues <unk w=","/> and <unk w="the"/> levied ;

Up to 30% of Canada 's population lives in rural , remote and <unk w="island"/> <unk w="parts"/> of the <unk w="environment"/> .
The health needs <unk w="of"/> rural Canadians are often different <unk w="from"/> <unk w="because"/> of urban Canadians <unk w=","/> northern and isolated communities face unique health challenges posed by geography and long distances .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> health care is one of five <unk w="fundamental"/> principles of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="public"/> Health Act .
Rural Canadians are increasingly voicing concern regarding disparities <unk w="and"/> services <unk w="and"/> in rural <unk w="and"/> remote areas with those in urban areas .
The Government of Canada <unk w="is"/> listening and responding to <unk w="the"/> health <unk w="of"/> <unk w="and"/> rural Canadians in many <unk w="areas"/> .
For example , the Office <unk w="of"/> Rural Health was established in September 1998 to <unk w="ensure"/> that the views and concerns of <unk w="the"/> Canadians <unk w="are"/> better reflected in national health <unk w="and"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="new"/> system renewal strategies .
<unk w="however"/> , in the <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> Budget , the Government of Canada announced funding of $ 50 million over three years ( 1999-2000 to 2001-2002 ) to support <unk w="the"/> <unk w="european"/> Rural and <unk w="public"/> Health .
<unk w="investment"/> in Rural and Community Health initiative
<unk w="this"/> initiative consists of <unk w="three"/> priority areas : rural and remote health ; <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="health"/> care ; access to , and affordability of , drugs ; and <unk w="terms"/> of service delivery .
The <unk w="health"/> and remote care component of the Innovations Initiative involves $ 16 million in funding , <unk w="including"/> a two-year , $ 11 - million rural health <unk w="is"/> program to <unk w="actually"/> address the <unk w="specific"/> concerns of rural citizens and communities , including those related to access to health care .
The remaining $ 34 million of the Innovations Initiative <unk w=","/> aimed generally at all Canadians but will serve to identify <unk w="the"/> <unk w="in"/> <unk w="need"/> to improve <unk w="access"/> to home <unk w=","/> community care , drugs and integrated health services <unk w=","/> rural as <unk w="the"/> <unk w="in"/> urban <unk w="development"/> .
Of this <unk w="background"/> , $ 2 million <unk w="will"/> be directed to national level work which specifically focuses on the needs and circumstances of <unk w="small"/> and remote communities in home care , primary care <unk w="and"/> quality .
In all these <unk w="areas"/> , the <unk w="majority"/> of Canada is working closely with provincial and <unk w="national"/> governments .
Health Canada has <unk w="always"/> taken some initial steps under the rural and remote <unk w="fishing"/> component .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w="fact"/> , Health Canada <unk w="is"/> a consultation workbook <unk w="the"/> use by federal <unk w="member"/> of Parliament in seeking the views of their rural <unk w="counterpart"/> about health care .
<unk w="the"/> Department also provided $ <unk w="reference"/> to the University of Northern British Columbia ( UNBC ) <unk w=","/> <unk w="is"/> an invitational Rural <unk w="and"/> <unk w="stockholm"/> Summit in October 1999 .
The <unk w="commission"/> <unk w="is"/> to establish a <unk w="system"/> of rural health researchers and began the process of establishing and understanding the place <unk w="and"/> <unk w="size"/> of rural <unk w="raw"/> research in Canada .
The Rural Health Research Summit also resulted in a <unk w="demand"/> for rural health research at UNBC .
The objective <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="commission"/> <unk w="is"/> to <unk w="go"/> the way ahead , to recommend a process by which <unk w="we"/> <unk w="will"/> <unk w="to"/> improve <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="that"/> the country can include rural citizens , to suggest <unk w=","/> <unk w="make"/> this research effort , and to address capacity issues .

This included a June 5 , 2000 <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> Toronto .

For example , the HTF , established in the 1997 federal Budget , is <unk w="the"/> 141 pilot and evaluation projects <unk w="and"/> <unk w="the"/> innovations leading to a stronger , more integrated health system .
Of <unk w="course"/> , <unk w="the"/> projects <unk w="and"/> budgets totalling $ 14 <unk w="to"/> directly address rural and remote <unk w="medical"/> care .

Best <unk w="practice"/> - Treatment and <unk w="purchase"/> for Driving While Impaired Offenders
Driving while <unk w="travel"/> by alcohol and / or other <unk w=","/> continues <unk w="to"/> <unk w="be"/> a major cause <unk w="for"/> vehicle <unk w="safety"/> , injuries and deaths <unk w="in"/> Canada .
The unprecedented reductions <unk w="in"/> impaired driving during <unk w="the"/> <unk w="has"/> reflected the many new prevention and awareness programs , <unk w="and"/> <unk w="the"/> activities that were developed during this period .
In <unk w="the"/> <unk w="connection"/> between <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="union"/> , the percent of fatally injured drinking drivers decreased from 62% <unk w="and"/> 45% .
In 2000 , 35.6% <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> drivers killed in crashes tested positive for alcohol .
Less is known about the <unk w="possibility"/> of driving while impaired by drugs , however <unk w=","/> provides evidence of increases in collision risk .
Laws <unk w="which"/> it <unk w="is"/> offence to <unk w="be"/> <unk w="the"/> impaired by alcohol have been in Canada 's Criminal Code for many years .
In 1969 , <unk w="the"/> impaired driving law was supplemented by a per se law , <unk w="but"/> <unk w="is"/> it an offence to drive with a Blood Alcohol Content ( <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> ) over 80 mg% .
Canada 's <unk w="judicial"/> Code <unk w="makes"/> it an offence , with penalties <unk w="imposed"/> <unk w="and"/> those for driving <unk w="in"/> a BAC over 80 mg% , to refuse to provide a breath test .
Driving while impaired <unk w="of"/> alcohol <unk w="consumption"/> / or other substances continues to be a major cause <unk w="for"/> vehicle crashes , injuries and deaths in <unk w="germany"/> .
One <unk w="thing"/> <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="minds"/> of the impaired driving problem in Canada that is of <unk w="much"/> relevance to the present project is the number of persons <unk w="affected"/> by <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> with a Criminal Code impaired driving offence .
Figure 1 presents <unk w="a"/> number and rate ( per 10,000 licensed drivers ) of <unk w="the"/> driving <unk w="force"/> in Canada from 1974 through <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> .
<unk w="the"/> total number <unk w="of"/> persons <unk w="involved"/> with impaired driving reached a peak <unk w="of"/> 162,048 <unk w="december"/> 1981 .
The number <unk w="of"/> impaired driving charges laid in a given <unk w="pricing"/> is , <unk w="of"/> course , partly a reflection of the <unk w="lack"/> of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
Figure 1 : Number and Rate* <unk w="displaced"/> Persons <unk w="occupied"/> with an Impaired Driving <unk w="force"/> ( <unk w="mr"/> 1974-2001 )
<unk w="however"/> , it is generally agreed that the unprecedented reductions in <unk w="drink"/> driving during the 1980s reflected the <unk w="current"/> new <unk w="millennium"/> and awareness programs , policies and <unk w="of"/> <unk w="which"/> were developed during this period .
A commonly used indicator of <unk w="the"/> magnitude of the DWI <unk w=","/> is <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> percent of fatally injured drivers who test positive for <unk w="the"/> presence of alcohol .
Figure 2 presents this indicator for <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
<unk w="this"/> is <unk w="therefore"/> in <unk w="the"/> figure that <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> 1970s , there <unk w="is"/> very little change in <unk w="the"/> magnitude <unk w="of"/> the problem .
In <unk w="fact"/> , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="view"/> of the <unk w="agreement"/> reached a peak in 1981 <unk w=","/> 62% of fatally injured drivers <unk w="were"/> <unk w="appear"/> to have consumed alcohol .
However , <unk w="in"/> the decade between 1981 and 1990 , the percent <unk w="of"/> fatally injured drinking drivers decreased from 62% to 45% .
<unk w="the"/> progress of the 1980s suffered a setback in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="a"/> part <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="dream"/> , but the downward <unk w="trend"/> has recently been re-established , albeit <unk w="in"/> a slower <unk w="rate"/> .
In 2000 , 35.6% of drivers killed in crashes tested <unk w="or"/> for alcohol .
In <unk w="fact"/> , the most recent <unk w="changes"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="of"/> data are <unk w="concerned"/> , <unk w="it"/> is estimated that 864 <unk w="people"/> were killed in motor <unk w="from"/> <unk w=","/> involving a driver who had been drinking ( Mayhew , <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and Simpson , <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> ) .
Although <unk w="what"/> and other indicators of impaired driving are <unk w="much"/> lower than <unk w="the"/> equivalents in previous decades , <unk w="the"/> driving is still a major concern .
Motor <unk w="insurance"/> collisions ( <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> ) , <unk w="all"/> of which are caused by drinking drivers , are a serious <unk w="health"/> and safety issue <unk w="in"/> Canada .
<unk w="why"/> were the seventh leading <unk w="out"/> of Potential Years of Life Lost ( PYLLs ) <unk w="("/> 1997 , <unk w="and"/> among <unk w="children"/> aged 0 <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> <unk w=","/> were <unk w="the"/> third leading cause <unk w="for"/> PYLLs ( <unk w="the"/> <unk w=")"/> Institute <unk w="("/> <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> , 2001 ) .
About one third of all deaths resulting from MVCs <unk w="in"/> a drinking driver ( Mayhew , Brown <unk w=","/> Simpson , 2002 ) .
Alcohol-related motor vehicle <unk w="takes"/> account for <unk w="members"/> of <unk w="the"/> alcohol-related hospitalizations and 12% of all <unk w="these"/> days in <unk w="the"/> ( Single et al. , 1996 ) .
They also account for 22% of all alcohol-related deaths and 33% of all alcohol-related <unk w="sorts"/> of life <unk w="'"/> ( Single et al. , <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> ) .
Single et al. ( <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> ) estimated <unk w="that"/> in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> Canada resulted in direct costs <unk w="and"/> damage of $ <unk w="traffic"/> .
Much less is known about the prevalence of driving while impaired by <unk w="the"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="of"/> alcohol , and the risks associated with this behaviour .
Canadian and international research does provide evidence <unk w="of"/> cannabis , <unk w="or"/> , possibly other illicit drugs such as hallucinogens , and some drugs used <unk w="for"/> therapeutic purposes , such as benzodiazepines , <unk w="all"/> the skills necessary for safe driving and are associated with significant increases in collision risk ( Dussault <unk w=","/> al. , <unk w="etc"/> ; Macdonald et al. , 2002 ) .
After alcohol , the drugs most <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> fatally injured <unk w=","/> are cannabis , <unk w="injured"/> and stimulants ( including cocaine ) ( Cimbura et al. , 1990 ; Stoduto <unk w=","/> al. , 1993 ) .
<unk w="ladies"/> and Mann ( 1999 ) reported <unk w=")"/> , <unk w="as"/> a representative sample of Ontario adult drivers , 1.9% said <unk w=","/> had driven within an hour of smoking cannabis at least once in the previous 12 months and the <unk w="annual"/> reporting driving <unk w="force"/> using cannabis <unk w="the"/> highest <unk w="and"/> younger respondents .
<unk w="most"/> recently , <unk w="commissioner"/> , Mann and Paglia ( 2003 ) reported that , among Ontario high school students with a <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="secretary"/> , 19.3% reported driving after using cannabis at <unk w="sea"/> once in the previous year .
Neutel ( <unk w="applause"/> ) , in a Saskatchewan <unk w="view"/> , reported that the likelihood of a traffic <unk w="has"/> increased significantly during the period after prescriptions for benzodiazepines <unk w="and"/> <unk w="period"/> , in <unk w="accordance"/> with controls who did not receive a prescription for benzodiazepines .
In a recent report of a random sample of Canadian drivers , 17.7% indicated that , during the past 12 <unk w="years"/> , they <unk w="are"/> driven within two hours of taking some type of <unk w="money"/> <unk w="which"/> could affect one 's ability to drive safely .
The drugs most <unk w="widely"/> used in this context were over-the-counter <unk w="debate"/> ( <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> ) , prescription medications ( <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> ) , cannabis ( 1.5% ) and other illegal drugs ( .9% ) ( Beirness et al. , <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> ) .
<unk w="thirdly"/> , successes in <unk w="the"/> drinking and driving <unk w="in"/> <unk w="the"/> country have not been the result of any single initiative ; <unk w="however"/> , <unk w="which"/> are the result of a broad and sustained <unk w="package"/> of measures by governments and non-government groups over this period .
Three main types of activities have been prominent <unk w="for"/> efforts to prevent impaired <unk w="accidents"/> during <unk w="the"/> past 15 to 20 years : ( 1 ) primary prevention , which <unk w="aims"/> <unk w="to"/> educate the general public about the dangers <unk w="of"/> <unk w="human"/> <unk w="butter"/> ; ( 2 ) secondary prevention , <unk w="and"/> increases <unk w="the"/> efficiency of law <unk w="enforcement"/> ; and ( 3 ) tertiary prevention , which aims <unk w="to"/> reduce the <unk w="number"/> of re-offending among those <unk w="members"/> of impaired driving , including educating offenders or treating them for a substance use problem .
A major thrust in <unk w="conflict"/> prevention has been to increase penalties for all types of impaired offenders and especially for <unk w="human"/> offenders .
Canada has a national Strategy to Reduce <unk w="drink"/> Driving ( STRID ) .
<unk w="the"/> STRID <unk w="task"/> Force is <unk w="under"/> <unk w="the"/> auspices of <unk w="the"/> Canadian <unk w="inspectors"/> of Motor Transport <unk w="transactions"/> ( CCMTA ) .
<unk w="the"/> CCMTA <unk w="the"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="a"/> Road Safety Vision 2010 ( Transport Canada , <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> ) , which <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> <unk w="an"/> enhanced plan to make Canada 's roads the safest in <unk w="the"/> world .
The plan is <unk w="caused"/> by <unk w="various"/> levels of government , <unk w="as"/> well as by public <unk w="and"/> private <unk w="and"/> stakeholders .
DWI offender <unk w=","/> <unk w="which"/> were <unk w="also"/> developed in the 1960s when <unk w="the"/> first <unk w="is"/> apparent that many such <unk w="issues"/> <unk w="is"/> little about <unk w="the"/> <unk w="consumption"/> of alcohol on driving performance <unk w="and"/> <unk w="these"/> issues , <unk w="which"/> had inappropriate <unk w="implications"/> to driving after <unk w="it"/> .
These programs had mixed and <unk w="straightforward"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> when used as alternatives to legal sanctions and <unk w="the"/> suspensions , without regard to individual <unk w="rights"/> in alcohol-related and other problems among those involved ( Mann , 1992 ) .
However , further research and analysis indicated that , when combined <unk w="a"/> licence suspensions , education programs did reduce the <unk w="number"/> <unk w="of"/> subsequent <unk w="serious"/> offences among offenders who did <unk w="not"/> have <unk w="any"/> alcohol use problems .
<unk w="these"/> programs are <unk w="also"/> <unk w="caused"/> by many <unk w="of"/> <unk w="of"/> DWI offenders are often required <unk w="to"/> attend such <unk w="a"/> <unk w="in"/> order <unk w="to"/> regain their <unk w="own"/> licences .
The first <unk w="draft"/> programs for impaired <unk w="few"/> offenders were probably developed and implemented on a limited basis <unk w="for"/> <unk w="the"/> 1960s ( Mann , 1992 ) .
Since then , programs have been developed <unk w="and"/> <unk w=","/> in many <unk w="parts"/> of the country .
The comprehensive <unk w="information"/> program in Manitoba <unk w="has"/> served as a model for programs in other provinces .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> / assessment and educational or <unk w="public"/> intervention programs are in place in <unk w="the"/> provinces / <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> and are <unk w=","/> by the STRID 2010 .
<unk w="we"/> require the offender to go through a <unk w="uniform"/> / assessment process <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> / or to <unk w="create"/> an educational <unk w="of"/> treatment intervention prior <unk w="to"/> licence <unk w="fees"/> .
In <unk w="the"/> jurisdictions with such programs , <unk w="there"/> are typically two or three levels of intervention .
<unk w="the"/> first level -- <unk w="the"/> first offenders or those considered to <unk w="be"/> low risk -- is usually a <unk w="good"/> educational session .
<unk w="the"/> second level <unk w="of"/> intervention is for offenders at an <unk w="important"/> stage of a substance <unk w="and"/> problem <unk w="and"/> at higher risk because of their attitudes and behaviours regarding drinking and driving .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w="this"/> takes place over a more <unk w="long"/> period <unk w="of"/> time and may involve a more comprehensive assessment , <unk w="as"/> well as an opportunity to work on <unk w="alternatives"/> to <unk w="the"/> identified problem areas .
The third level of intervention is <unk w="the"/> offenders assessed <unk w="by"/> having a serious substance <unk w=","/> problem or dependency and usually involves a referral to a substance abuse treatment program .
In those <unk w="countries"/> <unk w="we"/> have mandatory <unk w="medical"/> programs , there is <unk w="also"/> some cost-recovery for <unk w="putting"/> the assessment alone or for the <unk w="sake"/> and treatment .
2.3 Regulatory and <unk w="political"/> context <unk w="'"/> impaired driving
Laws making <unk w="such"/> an offence to drive while impaired by alcohol have been <unk w="on"/> Canada 's Criminal Code for many <unk w="years"/> .
In 1969 , the impaired driving law was supplemented by a per se law , <unk w="has"/> made it an <unk w="attempt"/> to drive with a <unk w="blood"/> Alcohol <unk w="policy"/> ( <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> ) over 80 mg% .
Per <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> laws had been introduced in Scandinavian countries and <unk w="in"/> Great Britain , where it was found that they greatly facilitated the processing of drinking-driving cases and resulted in significant reductions <unk w="in"/> collisions , <unk w="storage"/> and fatalities ( Mann et <unk w=")"/> , 2001 ; Ross , 1984 ) .
In addition , Canada 's Criminal Code <unk w="makes"/> it an offence , with penalties equivalent to those <unk w="who"/> driving with a <unk w="reduction"/> over 80 mg% , to <unk w="order"/> to provide a breath test .
The <unk w="genetic"/> Code <unk w="is"/> <unk w=","/> in 1985 , <unk w="with"/> new offences for impaired driving causing <unk w="any"/> harm and impaired <unk w="to"/> <unk w="of"/> death .
More recently , the Government <unk w="and"/> Canada <unk w="universally"/> the penalties in <unk w="the"/> Criminal Code for impaired driving , including a maximum <unk w="number"/> of life <unk w="in"/> prison for impaired driving causing death .
All provinces and territories also use their authority under their respective <unk w="national"/> traffic laws <unk w="to"/> impose administrative sanctions <unk w="and"/> <unk w="those"/> that apply to drivers convicted of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="or"/> drinking-driving offences .
These <unk w="elements"/> are independent of the Criminal Code and may include for <unk w="driving"/> licence suspensions that exceed the prohibition time <unk w="procedures"/> under <unk w="the"/> Criminal <unk w="court"/> .
These provincial and territorial <unk w="principles"/> and measures are invoked on conviction of a Criminal Code <unk w="of"/> offence .
As well , most provinces have the roadside licence suspension , an administrative sanction that applies to drivers with BAC levels lower than 80 mg% <unk w=","/> usually at 50 mg% .
These roadside licence suspensions take effect <unk w="will"/> , rather than upon conviction of a Criminal <unk w="court"/> DWI <unk w="it"/> .
<unk w="the"/> licence suspensions are ordered at <unk w="the"/> roadside <unk w="at"/> the discretion of police officers and licences are suspended <unk w="by"/> <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> or 24 <unk w="%"/> .
Some provinces keep official records of <unk w="the"/> roadside licence suspensions .

Does the <unk w="commission"/> believe <unk w="that"/> the current risk <unk w="of"/> programs ( RMP ) are adequate <unk w="and"/> sufficient for <unk w="the"/> isotretinoin-exposed pregnancies , <unk w="and"/> <unk w="the"/> fact that there are uncertainties associated with the rate / number of isotretinoin-exposed pregnancies in Canada and that a zero <unk w=","/> <unk w="of"/> isotretinoin-exposed pregnancies , although desirable , may be unrealistic ?
Does <unk w="the"/> Panel believe that current RMPs can <unk w="be"/> improved ?
How <unk w="can"/> the RMPs be substantially <unk w="in"/> <unk w="the"/> light of the fact <unk w="that"/> isotretinoin-exposed pregnancies appear mainly to result from the lack of <unk w="transparency"/> <unk w="of"/> the RMPs ?
<unk w="we"/> should <unk w="forget"/> the core elements of the RMP for isotretinoin ?
( e.g. physician <unk w=","/> check <unk w=")"/> , consent <unk w=")"/> , toll free number , web site , pregnancy test , patients / <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> / pharmacists registry , mandatory <unk w="gmo"/> for health <unk w="care"/> professionals , <unk w="etc"/> )
Does the Panel believe that the implementation in Canada <unk w="is"/> a Registry System , similar to the one proposed in the US , would <unk w="be"/> a substantial improvement to the current Canadian RMPs ?
Does <unk w="the"/> Panel believe that current warnings on the potential associations between isotretinoin and <unk w="eu"/> / suicide ideation are sufficient in light of the current knowledge on that issue ?
Should the RMP for isotretinoin <unk w=","/> a more substantive suicide prevention component ?

The overall goal of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="crisis"/> Management and Dissemination <unk w="assessment"/> ( RMDD ) is to <unk w="improve"/> the availability and quality of <unk w="work"/> for <unk w="women"/> , and to promote <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="and"/> decision-making <unk w="of"/> Health Canada .
This is achieved by identifying Health Canada 's future policy research needs , <unk w="and"/> extramural peer-reviewed research that addresses these needs under the Health Policy Research Program , and by communicating relevant research results within <unk w="the"/> Canada and <unk w="parliament"/> .
RMDD acts as a knowledge broker , <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> exchange and cooperation among health policy researchers and health policy makers .
The Division <unk w="of"/> the Health Policy Research Bulletin three <unk w="in"/> a <unk w="priority"/> .

about ReFacto ® ( <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> <unk/> ) , Antihemophilic Factor <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> <unk/> ) [ BDDrFVIII ] )
Reports of lack of effect , mainly in prophylaxis <unk w="terms"/> , <unk w="which"/> <unk w="was"/> received during the clinical <unk w="debate"/> and in the post-marketing <unk w="sector"/> .
The lack of effect and / or low factor VIII recovery has been reported in <unk w="accordance"/> with inhibitors but also <unk w="the"/> <unk w="those"/> who had no evidence of inhibitors .
The lack <unk w="of"/> effect has <unk w="been"/> described as bleeding <unk w="the"/> target joints , bleeding into <unk w="the"/> joints , other <unk w="countries"/> or a subjective <unk w="caused"/> by <unk w="the"/> patient of new <unk w="european"/> bleeding .
In <unk w="order"/> to ensure an adequate <unk w="precautionary"/> response , it is important TO INDIVIDUALLY <unk w="carefully"/> AND MONITOR <unk w="the"/> patient 's dose of <unk w="work"/> , particularly when initiating <unk w="dealt"/> with ReFacto
ReFacto , <unk w="another"/> Factor ( Recombinant ) [ <unk w="no"/> ] has been <unk w="adopted"/> in Canada since 2002 , <unk w="which"/> is <unk w="crucial"/> for the <unk w="lack"/> <unk w="of"/> prevention of hemorrhagic episodes and for routine and surgical <unk w=","/> in patients with hemophilia A ( congenital <unk w=")"/> VIII <unk w=")"/> or classic hemophilia ) .
ReFacto does <unk w="not"/> contain <unk w="a"/> Willebrand factor and hence is not <unk w="borne"/> in <unk w="the"/> Willebrand 's disease .
As a follow-up to our previous discussions , <unk w="we"/> are advising you of <unk w="the"/> amendments to the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="parliament"/> ( <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> attached* ) that Wyeth Canada <unk w="has"/> made to <unk w="the"/> information <unk w="available"/> <unk w="to"/> us via voluntary reports of adverse <unk w="effects"/> <unk w="on"/> the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="sector"/> .
<unk w="it"/> is Wyeth 's <unk w="tremendous"/> <unk w="approach"/> to work closely with hemophilia clinicians and to strongly encourage voluntary adverse <unk w="public"/> reporting regarding <unk w="the"/> use of ReFacto .
Such <unk w="measures"/> enables the medical profession and Wyeth <unk w="will"/> continue <unk w="to"/> increase the <unk w="overall"/> <unk w="number"/> of Refacto .
It also provides <unk w="the"/> direction in our scientific exploration <unk w="in"/> this therapeutic area .
Reports of lack of effect , mainly in prophylaxis <unk w="case"/> , have been received during <unk w="the"/> clinical <unk w="debate"/> and in the post-marketing <unk w="sector"/> .
The lack of effect and / or <unk w="quantitative"/> factor VIII recovery has been reported in patients with <unk w="interest"/> but also in patients who <unk w="are"/> <unk w="the"/> evidence of inhibitors .
<unk w="the"/> lack of effect has been described as bleeding into target joints , bleeding into <unk w="the"/> joints , other bleeding or a <unk w="deep"/> feeling by <unk w="the"/> patient of new onset bleeding .
<unk w="in"/> order to ensure an <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> therapeutic <unk w="cloning"/> , it is <unk w="important"/> TO <unk w="be"/> TITRATE <unk w="to"/> MONITOR each <unk w="individual"/> <unk w="the"/> dose of ReFacto , <unk w="and"/> initiating <unk w=","/> with ReFacto .
It is estimated that from the International Birth Date ( 13 <unk w="/"/> 1999 ) through 12 April 2003 , <unk w="["/> 5,800 ( ± 1000 ) patients used ReFacto in the post-marketing setting .
Cumulatively through <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> April 2003 , 85 post-marketing <unk w="tonnes"/> of less than desired <unk w="economic"/> effect and / or low recovery with ReFacto , for which concurrent inhibitor data is negative or not provided have been received .
<unk w="the"/> data regarding these reports is <unk w="not"/> limited due to <unk w="the"/> voluntary nature .
Reports of less than expected <unk w=","/> <unk w="we"/> have <unk w="a"/> <unk w="very"/> consistent characteristics .
Reports <unk w="are"/> described bleeding into target joints , bleeding into new joints , <unk w="the"/> bleeding or subjective <unk w=","/> by patients of new <unk w="member"/> bleeding .
<unk w="in"/> some <unk w="cases"/> , patients either had a history of inhibitors or had an inhibitor at the time <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="debate"/> .
In <unk w="some"/> instances bleeding was not documented but the report <unk w="is"/> <unk w=","/> because the patient experienced increased bruising , <unk w="the"/> sensation <unk w="the"/> bleeding into target joints , or required higher <unk w="than"/> anticipated <unk w="than"/> for bleed <unk w="farmers"/> .
<unk w="both"/> reports describe <unk w="those"/> who experienced increased bleeding <unk w="and"/> switching <unk w="from"/> <unk w="and"/> ReFacto .
<unk w="the"/> patients who experience a less <unk w="and"/> desired effect it <unk w="is"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> titrate the dose of ReFacto <unk w="to"/> achieve <unk w="the"/> desired effect .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w="is"/> determined <unk w="on"/> the basis of spontaneously reported post-marketing <unk w="these"/> events are generally presumed to <unk w="reduce"/> the risks associated <unk w="with"/> drug treatments .
The identification , characterization , and <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of drug-related adverse events is dependent on the active participation of health care professionals in <unk w="the"/> drug reaction <unk w="and"/> programmes .
Health care professionals are asked <unk w="to"/> report any suspected <unk w="of"/> reactions in patients receiving ReFacto ® <unk w="the"/> <unk w=")"/> <unk/> , <unk w=")"/> <unk/> ( Recombinant ) [ BDDrFVIII ] ) directly <unk w="women"/> <unk/> or the Marketed Health Products Directorate .
Your professional commitment <unk w="in"/> this regard has an <unk w="important"/> role <unk w="in"/> protecting the <unk w="environment"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="and"/> patients by contributing <unk w="to"/> early <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> detection <unk w="and"/> informed drug use .

An FAS / E community information session could bring forward people who believe they or someone they care <unk w="to"/> have FAS / <unk w="or"/> This could cause a personal or family crisis .
People making such <unk w="we"/> need an informed and caring support network .

People making disclosures may need <unk w="to"/> support from qualified careproviders .
The support team should be <unk w="given"/> to <unk w="our"/> on-going support .

Presenting information <unk w="regarding"/> FAS / E requires someone with skills in <unk w="terms"/> <unk w=","/> an indepth knowledge of FAS / E.
<unk w="thirdly"/> , resource workers <unk w="should"/> have training <unk w="for"/> workshop presentation , <unk w="generally"/> speaking or attended a train-the-trainers program .

What Happens When <unk w="we"/> <unk w="is"/> Drinks <unk w="""/> Pregnancy ?
Understanding <unk w="children"/> and Young Adults with FAS / E
Rapid organ development <unk w="cooperation"/> in the <unk w="early"/> stages of pregnancy .
Organ <unk w="and"/> <unk w="not"/> throughout the pregnancy but at a slower pace than the <unk w="second"/> stage .
Alcohol <unk w="has"/> <unk w="comes"/> into the blood , from the stomach and intestines <unk w="are"/> transferred to the liver .
The alcohol is broken down in the liver by <unk w="the"/> enzyme systems .
In the pregnant woman , alcohol easily crosses the placenta <unk w="of"/> the circulatory system <unk w="in"/> the fetus .
The fetus cannot rid <unk w="of"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w=","/> as quickly <unk w="as"/> the mother because of its small and underdeveloped <unk w="political"/> and <unk w="the"/> system .
The fetus is exposed to alcohol for <unk w="long"/> periods than the drinking mother .
Drinking at anytime <unk w=","/> <unk w="it"/> could possibly affect the normal <unk w="mexican"/> <unk w="of"/> the baby .
Not drinking at all is one sure way <unk w="to"/> increase <unk w="the"/> likelihood of a <unk w="new"/> baby .
<unk w="in"/> the mother <unk w="of"/> <unk w="solana"/> , interventions to stop <unk w="at"/> <unk w="at"/> <unk w="this"/> time during pregnancy will help the chances of a <unk w="new"/> baby .
What <unk w="happens"/> When <unk w="the"/> Mother <unk w="itself"/> During Pregnancy ?
<unk w="this"/> is a <unk w="major"/> agent which can damage <unk w="human"/> cells in developing organs .
Damage to the <unk w="european"/> cause malformations <unk w="problem"/> growing organs .
All fetal organs can <unk w="be"/> adversely affected , to <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> , at <unk w="the"/> time if alcohol is consumed throughout the pregnancy .
<unk w="the"/> more the mother drinks , the greater exposure to alcohol and the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> risk of fetal damage .
Fetal brain development <unk w="accordingly"/> throughout <unk w="accordingly"/> .
The fetus is forced to divert its energy to metabolize the <unk w="sea"/> instead of using energy to grow healthy cells and tissues .
<unk w="it"/> affects the ability to organize and communicate <unk w="them"/> within the brain .
This impairs the ability to use <unk w="the"/> judgement and reason later on in <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> .
The effects of paternal drinking on the <unk w="environment"/> are <unk w="made"/> fully known .
Some children of <unk w="moroccan"/> fathers have defects <unk w="for"/> learning and memory and <unk w="want"/> to <unk w="do"/> more hyperactive than children of non-alcoholic <unk w="and"/> parents .
It <unk w="is"/> not known if <unk w="the"/> effects are the result of genetic transmission <unk w="as"/> <unk w="the"/> result of paternal alcohol consumption <unk w="and"/> the father 's sperm prior to <unk w="it"/> .
There is no conclusive <unk w="view"/> that <unk w="our"/> drinking before conception causes direct adverse effects on the fetus .
At the time of conception , alcohol can result <unk w="in"/> a lower sperm count and abnormal sperm , making the likelihood of pregnancy remote .

Resiliency : Relevance To Health Promotion - Detailed <unk w="information"/>
In 1993 , a number of units within the <unk w="community"/> Promotion <unk w="facility"/> , <unk w="medical"/> Programs and Services Branch , Health Canada , under the leadership of Alcohol and <unk w="on"/> Drugs Programs , initiated the first <unk w="revision"/> of a <unk w="former"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="of"/> resiliency and its application to health promotion research , policy and <unk w="development"/> .
This document <unk w="forms"/> part of a series <unk w="of"/> <unk w="two"/> <unk w="proposals"/> : An <unk w="individual"/> bibliography , a detailed analysis <unk w="of"/> a discussion paper produced <unk w="in"/> <unk w="the"/> Atlantic Health Promotion Research Centre , Dalhousie <unk w="comes"/> under contract to Health Canada .
As part of the project , a <unk w="result"/> of four focus groups hosted by the Health <unk w="and"/> Research Centres in Halifax , <unk w="etc"/> , Saskatoon and Montreal were held <unk w="in"/> order to review and contribute to the final <unk w="stage"/> of the discussion paper .
The concept of resiliency <unk w="is"/> a fresh <unk w="opportunity"/> for the field of health promotion .
The theory and research in resiliency has a <unk w="lot"/> of <unk w="access"/> to <unk w="the"/> <unk w="it"/> .
Before <unk w="all"/> these applications , a definition of resiliency will be established and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="this"/> concept and its relevance to health promotion will be considered .
Finally , applications <unk w="on"/> resiliency <unk w=","/> and <unk w="books"/> will be suggested in terms of health promotion programming <unk w="agricultural"/> policy .
Information - The Safety of <unk w="chain"/> <unk w="chain"/> Food Crops
Before a new agricultural or food product <unk w="cannot"/> be produced <unk w="in"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , it is subjected to thorough safety assessments to protect humans , animals <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="meal"/> .
The <unk w="use"/> categorizes genetically modified products as " novel " products .
This term covers products that have not been previously available for sale in <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , or are produced by a new process , such as genetic engineering .
Under <unk w="the"/> Food <unk w="chain"/> <unk w="to"/> Act , Health Canada has established a stringent process for evaluating the safety <unk w="of"/> foods derived through <unk w="genetic"/> modification ( often referred to as biotechnology-derived foods or <unk w="""/> foods ) .
The specific criteria for the safety assessment of such foods are outlined in <unk w="terms"/> <unk w="and"/> Canada publication " Guidelines for <unk w="product"/> Safety Assessment <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> Foods . "
Health <unk w="policy"/> conducts a thorough safety assessment of <unk w="the"/> biotechnology-derived food before it enters the marketplace to ensure there are no health and safety concerns .
To date 50 genetically modified foods have <unk w="been"/> approved for use in Canada .
There are five acts under which biotechnology <unk w="charges"/> are <unk w="affected"/> by the CFIA : the Feeds Act , Fertilizers Act , Seeds Act , Health of Animals Act <unk w="on"/> the Plant Protection Act .
The CFIA regulates seeds , plants , animals , <unk w="and"/> biologics , fertilizers <unk w=","/> <unk w="and"/> , <unk w="particularly"/> those derived from biotechnology .
The CFIA carries out safety <unk w="and"/> <unk w="to"/> evaluate <unk w="the"/> agricultural products for their efficacy and <unk w="the"/> safety of <unk w="the"/> worker / bystanders , animals and the environment .
To date , 36 genetically modified plants <unk w="has"/> been <unk w="eligible"/> for <unk w="the"/> release and for <unk w="animal"/> feed usage .
An additional 3 <unk w="%"/> have been approved for livestock feed usage only , for example , cotton seeds used for feed but not for growing .
The safety <unk w="of"/> <unk w="of"/> foods developed <unk w="by"/> genetic modification includes the following considerations :
<unk w="if"/> the food crop was developed , including the molecular <unk w="of"/> data which characterizes <unk w="the"/> genetic <unk w="modification"/> ;
nutritional information for <unk w="the"/> novel food compared to non-modified counterparts ;
In assessing the safety <unk w="of"/> <unk w="of"/> foods , we undertake a <unk w="good"/> scientific assessment .
Only when we are completely <unk w="to"/> do <unk w="to"/> approve the product .
Additional research or testing <unk w="will"/> be required if Health <unk w="and"/> scientists are <unk w="not"/> satisfied <unk w="with"/> any <unk w="increase"/> in the safety assessment process .
Only if all of Health Canada 's stringent criteria <unk w="are"/> met is a novel food allowed access to <unk w="the"/> <unk w="european"/> market .
<unk w="the"/> safety assessment process is based upon principles developed <unk w="in"/> international <unk w="union"/> consultations <unk w="carried"/> out by the World Health <unk w="organisation"/> ( WHO ) and the <unk w="palestinian"/> and <unk w="the"/> Organization ( FAO ) of the <unk w="united"/> Nations , and the Organization for <unk w="the"/> Co-operation <unk w="and"/> Development ( OECD ) .
The Government <unk w="and"/> Canada is committed to the <unk w="peace"/> process of ensuring <unk w="that"/> its <unk w="use"/> of genetically modified foods are <unk w="one"/> <unk w="by"/> the state of <unk w="the"/> science and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="production"/> of food and plant <unk w="systems"/> that are being <unk w="used"/> <unk w="by"/> research .
<unk w="a"/> part of this commitment , Health Canada has been engaged <unk w="in"/> formal consultations <unk w="with"/> the <unk w="last"/> eight <unk w="years"/> regarding <unk w="the"/> assessment and approval of <unk w="the"/> foods .
To Document Neonatal Exposure of Endocrine <unk w=","/> Chemicals <unk w="on"/> Human Amniotic Fluid
Many <unk w="tens"/> are known to interact with the hormonal system , <unk w="and"/> in wildlife , <unk w="and"/> there <unk w="is"/> circumstancial evidence that <unk w="it"/> <unk w="is"/> also <unk w="mentioned"/> .
Examples are polychorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> phytoestrogens , which are naturally occurring plant chemicals .
The goal of this Project <unk w="is"/> to investigate <unk w="whether"/> neonates are exposed to these chemicals .
We have developed very sophisticated analytical procedures that <unk w="will"/> allow us <unk w="to"/> measure <unk w="this"/> contaminants down to very low levels ( <unk w="eur"/> per billion ) in <unk w="the"/> fluids using small amounts of sample , usually one <unk w="or"/> two ml.
Our study subjects were women <unk w="from"/> Southern Alberta , 35 <unk w="years"/> of age <unk w="and"/> over .
Our preliminary results showed that no PCB <unk w=","/> or pesticides were detected in amniotic fluids .
However , there were phytoestrogens in the majority <unk w="of"/> the samples .
The phytoestrogens we measured were daidzein and genistein , which are derived <unk w="away"/> from soy products .
Their concentrations <unk w="is"/> much higher <unk w="than"/> that <unk w="is"/> <unk w="of"/> female sex hormone at the same stage of <unk w="work"/> .
However , the female sex hormone is much more potent , and whether the presence of these chemicals has any health effects on <unk w="the"/> fetus <unk w="have"/> to be seen .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> blood samples were also positive for the phytoestrogens , usually ten times the <unk w="incidence"/> of those in the amni-otic <unk w="sector"/> .
Many samples also had DDE , a metabolite of the pesticide <unk w="crisis"/> , the fungicide hexachlorobenzene and <unk w="the"/> PCB compounds .
It is also of interest to investigate whether the presence <unk w="of"/> these compounds in the mother <unk w="of"/> blood has any health consequence to <unk w="the"/> baby .
We also collected cord blood at birth and a breast milk sample from the <unk w="sea"/> at a later date .
It is expected that many of these compounds are <unk w="at"/> present <unk w="for"/> the mother 's milk and they will be passed <unk w="on"/> <unk w="in"/> the baby through breastfeeding .
Indeed in another study we have found <unk w="the"/> <unk w="it"/> , <unk w="bse"/> and hexachlorobenzene in many breast <unk w="the"/> samples obtained from Albertans .
On the other hand , <unk w="i"/> did not find <unk w="any"/> milk <unk w="or"/> with phytoestrogens .
<unk w="the"/> environmental <unk w="crime"/> was <unk w="missing"/> from <unk w="this"/> subject during <unk w="the"/> counselling prior to <unk w="it"/> .
They were asked about their dietary intake , specific diets , beverage consumption , medical condition and <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="from"/> the previous <unk w="directive"/> .
Statistical analysis was <unk w="based"/> on <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> questionnaire and test results .
One interesting preliminary finding was that there was a correlation between <unk w="them"/> in the previous year and the presence of phytoestrogens in the amniotic fluid .
This Project is still ongoing <unk w="and"/> will eventually enlist three <unk w="important"/> subjects .
Health Canada <unk w=","/> parents <unk w="and"/> <unk w="people"/> of very young children to dispose <unk w="of"/> soft <unk w="villages"/> ( PVC ) <unk w=")"/> and soft vinyl ( PVC ) rattles
<unk w="however"/> - <unk w="as"/> a precautionary measure , Health Canada <unk w="has"/> issued <unk w="an"/> advisory to parents and <unk w="those"/> of very young children regarding <unk w="their"/> vinyl products designed to <unk w="be"/> mouthed ( sucked or <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> ) .
Health Canada 's risk assessment of these products has <unk w="demonstrated"/> that a <unk w="series"/> <unk w="which"/> stems <unk w="from"/> the plasticizer , a phthalate <unk w="of"/> DINP , <unk w="which"/> is used <unk w="to"/> make soft vinyl soft .
<unk w="these"/> tests on animals have shown that intense DINP exposure can cause potential damage to the kidneys <unk w="of"/> liver .
This advisory does not apply to pacifiers and feeding bottle <unk w="meal"/>
<unk w="congratulations"/> on <unk w=","/> to date , Health <unk w="safety"/> has <unk w="caused"/> no products <unk w="or"/> <unk w="a"/> <unk w="or"/> containing DINP .
<unk w="but"/> Canada will continue <unk w="to"/> monitor <unk w="accordingly"/> products .
The products addressed <unk w="by"/> this advisory are as follows :
Products designed for sucking or <unk w=")"/> ( <unk w="the"/> teethers , soft rattles ) which are <unk w="part"/> of soft vinyl ( PVC ) pose a potential health risk to very young children ( weighing less than eight kilograms ) when sucked <unk w=","/> chewed <unk w="and"/> prolonged <unk w="behaviour"/> ( three hours or more a day on a <unk w="european"/> <unk w="basis"/> ) .
Parents <unk w="and"/> caregivers are advised to dispose of these products .
<unk w="in"/> Canada <unk w="is"/> working closely with retailers to identify <unk w="and"/> <unk w="with"/> any <unk w="more"/> harmful <unk w="effects"/> from store shelves <unk w="it"/> .
There are teethers and <unk w="we"/> currently on store <unk w="and"/> that have been identified as safe <unk w="as"/> <unk w="possible"/> .
A list of these <unk w="amendments"/> <unk w="does"/> not <unk w="only"/> contain DINP is attached .
A selection of consumer <unk w="protection"/> <unk w="will"/> have all <unk w="been"/> positive in Health Canada laboratories for the possibility of containing polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) .
The pencil indicates <unk w="the"/> relative size of <unk w="disease"/> <unk w="disease"/> .
Small soft vinyl toys often used in cribs or <unk w="humans"/>
In addition , parents or caregivers are advised to <unk w="see"/> their children <unk w="to"/> use <unk w="any"/> other <unk w="products"/> , soft vinyl toys not specifically designed <unk w="to"/> sucking and chewing but often found in <unk w="business"/> or <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and to remove <unk w="the"/> products from the child <unk w="and"/> environment if they observe that the child is <unk w="involved"/> or <unk w="providing"/> them for <unk w="long"/> periods ( three <unk w=")"/> or more a day , on a daily basis ) .
While the <unk w="dream"/> of extended sucking and chewing <unk w="is"/> still under study , this <unk w="time"/> advisory has been issued <unk w="by"/> a <unk w="range"/> <unk w="of"/> scientific indications <unk w="about"/> a potential health <unk w="care"/> for <unk w="young"/> children <unk w="and"/> <unk w="no"/> less than eight kilograms who <unk w="have"/> high oral ( <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> ) contact <unk w="with"/> these products ( three hours a day , on a daily basis ) .
Because soft vinyl ( PVC ) <unk w="or"/> containing DINP cannot be <unk w="imported"/> from other soft plastics <unk w="'s"/> appearance , touch or smell , parents and caregivers are advised <unk w="to"/> monitor the use <unk w="of"/> these products by very young children .
Health Canada has asked manufacturers <unk w="for"/> small , soft vinyl toys , to find a safe <unk w="premium"/> for vinyl <unk w="and"/> DINP <unk w="and"/> <unk w="the"/> next six months.\
<unk w="in"/> respect to soft vinyl products for children other than <unk w="are"/> often used in cribs and playpens , <unk w="and"/> Canada <unk w=","/> <unk w="to"/> advise that specific action be taken at <unk w="the"/> time .
<unk w="most"/> recently , <unk w="the"/> nature <unk w=","/> <unk w="the"/> health risk posed <unk w="by"/> the exposure of young children to <unk w="live"/> in soft vinyl children 's products was <unk w="well"/> known .
<unk w=","/> over a year , Health Canada has <unk w="been"/> working with international health agencies <unk w="to"/> evaluate the risk from these products .
To <unk w="conclude"/> , a few countries <unk w="in"/> Europe have announced intentions to restrict <unk w="the"/> use of DINP <unk w="for"/> these products .
Health <unk w="care"/> is also monitoring what is happening in countries where no action has been taken to date , such as the U.S. and some other European countries .
Health Canada <unk w="cannot"/> <unk w="in"/> this health advisory as a <unk w="whole"/> <unk w="which"/> <unk w="to"/> enable parents <unk w="to"/> caregivers to make informed decisions about their <unk w="children"/> 's health .
A list of teethers and rattles known not to <unk w="be"/> DINP is attached .
