Furthermore , in view of the shortage of available credit , there is a threat <unk w="of"/> energy and <unk w="market"/> crises .
In order <unk w="to"/> maintain at least the <unk w="high"/> level of energy production , there will be a need by 2030 for worldwide investment of about USD <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> billion in reconstruction and the development of new oil and gas fields and also in the production and distribution of all types of <unk w="transport"/> .
At the same time it will be necessary to integrate <unk w="the"/> flows of oil , gas and electricity so <unk w="as"/> to create an efficient and highly diversified system .
This system must help to <unk w="the"/> consequences of local political disputes and also consequences of any natural disasters and to provide for a functioning energy supply in a <unk w="global"/> context .
The Slovak Republic itself <unk w="has"/> had the opportunity in recent weeks to <unk w="discuss"/> the complexity <unk w="of"/> such a situation when , as a result of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia , not a <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> cubic metre of gas <unk w="and"/> Slovakia for several days .
The experience of Slovakia <unk w="and"/> also <unk w="the"/> other European countries has shown that vigorous support is needed for the European Union 's priority of interconnecting and <unk w="on"/> the separate energy markets in Europe .
However , I must mention that the enforced and premature decommissioning of two reactors at the Jaslovsk√© Bohunice nuclear power plant has been found to <unk w="be"/> an imprudent <unk w="increase"/> in the current situation .
Their decommissioning <unk w="is"/> required by the European Commission in the Accession Treaty as <unk w="a"/> price for Slovakia 's accession to the European <unk w="union"/> .
( EL ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the <unk w="fight"/> against climate change and the need <unk w="for"/> energy security and to strengthen the <unk w="competitiveness"/> of our economy are taking us down the road of the third <unk w="information"/> revolution , towards <unk w="an"/> era in which we wean ourselves off mineral fuels .
It is a real revolution which will bring about huge structural changes to the model of production and consumption and , ultimately , to <unk w="the"/> very way of life .
In order for that to happen , we shall need to make every possible effort to limit <unk w="the"/> energy intensity of <unk w="the"/> economy in all sectors .
One of the tools <unk w="for"/> improving energy efficiency is to make use of the <unk w="provision"/> of information and communication technologies ( ICT ) .
<unk w="more"/> incentives are needed in order for <unk w="companies"/> <unk w="to"/> make use of <unk w="new"/> technologies , so that we increase the energy efficiency of the European Union by 20 % by 2020 , within the framework of the 20-20-20 target .
<unk w="the"/> motion which we are being <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> <unk w="is"/> to adopt in a couple of days ' time and which relates to the strengthening of energy efficiency through ICT places particular emphasis on research and development of pioneering technologies , such as <unk w="science"/> and photonic technology , which have high potential to improve energy efficiency , and on designing policies to strengthen the take-up of these <unk w="funds"/> .
I would refer in particular to green public procurements , which will allow public sector agencies to play a leading role <unk w="in"/> saving energy by making use <unk w="of"/> the new technological applications of ICT .
Finally , the <unk w="directive"/> provides for incentives for smart <unk w="and"/> integrated energy management systems in our cities and for smart traffic management systems <unk w="and"/> more <unk w="of"/> road behaviour and <unk w="control"/> systems .
It is clear from what I have <unk w="said"/> that , although it is not <unk w="possible"/> , this motion <unk w="evening"/> we shall vote on in a couple of days ' time is <unk w="very"/> important , because it essentially makes ICT one of the main indicators of sustainable development in the European <unk w="union"/> .
I therefore call on you <unk w="to"/> support it in the vote in a couple of days ' time .
( <unk w="es"/> ) Mr President , we are , I hope , all clear on what the priorities are here : <unk w="the"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , energy <unk w="policy"/> and <unk w="renewable"/> energy .
So , what lessons <unk w="do"/> we learn from the dispute between Ukraine and Russia , and from the crisis <unk w="it"/> arose from that dispute ?
In my view - and I am <unk w="sorry"/> to have to say this , Commissioner - it seems to me that we will be no better , or at least not much better , prepared the next time this happens .
Neither can it be said that the crisis is over , and I have seen little sign that a strategy is really being <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , or <unk w="that"/> any conclusions have been drawn from this dispute between Ukraine and Russia .
Certain Members of this House believe that we should conclude bilateral agreements with Ukraine , but <unk w="it"/> should be pointed out that Ukraine has to bear at least some of <unk w="the"/> blame for the <unk w="problems"/> <unk w="that"/> arose <unk w="here"/> , <unk w="but"/> I would really rather not make myself dependent on arguments <unk w="by"/> Mr Yushchenko and Mrs Tymoshenko , or Mr Yanukovych , or whoever .
Ukraine would , quite naturally , clearly much rather buy the gas from Russia <unk w="and"/> then sell it on to us , naturally for an additional charge , as would Turkey in relation to <unk w="it"/> , <unk w="and"/> I will return <unk w="to"/> that later .
If , then , we want our gas to be <unk w="treated"/> as insecure , but more expensive , <unk w="we"/> should make a bilateral agreement but , if we <unk w="are"/> to find a real <unk w="solution"/> , we need to make a trilateral agreement encompassing Russia as the supplier , Ukraine as the transit country and ourselves , and come to an agreement <unk w="in"/> <unk w="this"/> connection , particularly with regard to transit and infrastructure .
I have <unk w="heard"/> nothing from <unk w="the"/> Commission on this or on what alternative <unk w="is"/> it <unk w="is"/> .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w="regard"/> to investments in infrastructure , if we look to the east , there <unk w="are"/> basically three pipelines up for discussion : Nord Stream , South <unk w="africa"/> and Nabucco .
Nord Stream <unk w="is"/> a <unk w="new"/> pipeline in the <unk w="future"/> ; it solves <unk w="the"/> transit problem , but will not reduce <unk w="its"/> dependency on Russia .
On <unk w="top"/> of that , if one looks at the costs involved , South Stream is <unk w="much"/> <unk w="much"/> more expensive than Nabucco , at least according to a number of studies , which suggests that we need to invest massively in Nabucco .
When I consider - and I have mentioned this on a few previous occasions as well , Commissioner - how quickly the United States <unk w="and"/> the PTCP <unk w="in"/> pipeline and how long we are taking over <unk w="the"/> Nabucco gas pipeline , I really do think it is scandalous how little Europe has achieved : it is a sign of our weakness .
<unk w="we"/> need to act quickly , not just with regard to Azerbaijan or Turkmenistan - <unk w="and"/> we will be discussing shortly - but also in relation to Iraq .
The fact that gas there <unk w="is"/> simply being <unk w="put"/> into the air as exhaust , with no consideration <unk w=","/> given to how it <unk w="can"/> be transported to the Nabucco pipeline , really <unk w="is"/> a big mistake .
<unk w="it"/> will , of course , also need to <unk w="invite"/> Cyprus to stop blocking the energy chapter : their <unk w="suggestion"/> that we cannot even negotiate on this chapter shows a lack <unk w="of"/> solidarity , because it quite naturally causes difficulties <unk w="in"/> Turkey .
You are nodding , Commissioner ; I see that we <unk w="are"/> in full agreement here .
Turning finally to nuclear energy , <unk w="there"/> are some <unk w="very"/> different opinions on <unk w="this"/> subject in this House .
Unfortunately , I too cannot vote <unk w="in"/> favour of the Laperrouze report , for example because it is <unk w="very"/> one-sided in this respect .
The <unk w="feeling"/> that disturbs me about this whole debate is that we now have a new development in France , <unk w="and"/> a reduction in <unk w="the"/> waste , but , when you look <unk w="very"/> closely , you find that this atomic waste is more radioactive .
We will need to apply a lot more energy and <unk w="ways"/> to solving the problem of waste <unk w="and"/> disposal .
( PL ) Mr President , the <unk w="bse"/> crisis has revealed a weakness in the <unk w="european"/> Union .
We are still having problems <unk w="and"/> reading the political challenges resulting from this situation .
A glaring illustration of this mistake is the proposal of Angela Merkel who , after a third energy crisis , <unk w="are"/> proposing to us today still stronger ties with Russian energy resources by building <unk w="the"/> northern and southern gas pipelines .
This crisis shows that <unk w="we"/> should stake everything on the building of an independent infrastructure which will take us to independent sources <unk w="and"/> the raw materials for energy in Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan .
The crisis shows that we should strike the northern gas <unk w="sea"/> off the list of European <unk w="union"/> priorities in order to avoid a Russian monopoly in Europe .
Solving the energy problem will <unk w="be"/> a critical moment in <unk w="terms"/> <unk w="european"/> integration <unk w="process"/> .
( ES ) Mr President , I <unk w="would"/> like to <unk w="speak"/> about the need to <unk w="use"/> the information technology revolution of the information society with the energy <unk w="sector"/> , which has been the subject of an excellent resolution of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="report"/> .
We need smart electricity grids ; currently these <unk w="are"/> <unk w="areas"/> and anachronistic .
We need consumption that is <unk w="more"/> in accordance with production .
This smart consumption can only be provided by the Internet and <unk w="also"/> by the fusion of all electrical networks with the information <unk w="provided"/> from houses , factories , buildings and so on .
In this <unk w="way"/> we could be much more autonomous , much more independent , and Europe could take a leading <unk w="role"/> in this essential global issue so that there would not <unk w="have"/> to be dozens of unnecessary power stations as is the case today .
In this way we could also <unk w="deal"/> with neighbouring countries in the Mediterranean .
An extensive , clean , smart grid is needed to connect to our neighbours in the south who have the potential to generate solar energy using high technology and large-scale <unk w="transport"/> .
This would be an excellent opportunity for cooperation on technology <unk w="matters"/> .
Let me make a few points on the Strategic Energy Review and the <unk w="most"/> <unk w="of"/> crisis problem , which are closely linked .
<unk w="the"/> first point : in our <unk w="opinion"/> , which calls on <unk w="all"/> Member States to speak with a single European voice on energy issues , we have explicitly stated what all Europeans have seen in the past weeks to be the reality , namely that damaging energy supply in <unk w="the"/> Member States afflicts the European Union as a whole .
<unk w="this"/> is the basis of European solidarity <unk w="as"/> a basis for <unk w="an"/> emergency response measures .
My second point is that the report mentions CCS technology as having the potential to <unk w="improve"/> our environmental targets while <unk w="respecting"/> a source of energy - <unk w="commissioner"/> - that <unk w="is"/> largely available in Europe .
By developing CCS , Europe can become a world leader in advanced <unk w="countries"/> , which <unk w="will"/> contribute <unk w="to"/> our <unk w="european"/> competitiveness and strengthen our economies .
The same is true for coal gasification technology , <unk w="which"/> is very important as an <unk w="additional"/> source of gas supply - it means diversification of gas <unk w="emissions"/> .
My <unk w="second"/> point is that this strategic document specifically underlines the need for investment in the energy supply infrastructure .
Infrastructure projects that receive support at EU level should first <unk w="and"/> foremost contribute to the real diversification of sources and routes of <unk w="aid"/> to <unk w="the"/> Member States and <unk w="in"/> the EU as a whole .
<unk w="together"/> with our <unk w="social"/> partners , we could , in the future , take the joint responsibility for gas deliveries on the Russian-Ukrainian border .
<unk w="the"/> reason for such a step on our part is very simple .
<unk w="in"/> terms of energy relations , Ukraine identifies with international standards .
It has ratified the Energy Charter Treaty and , therefore , plays by transparent <unk w="means"/> .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="it"/> is that our strategic document greatly complements our efforts towards implementing the Third Energy Package .
It <unk w="is"/> a working internal market in energy for the European Union ; it means solidarity and support on many sides .
Let <unk w="me"/> finish the <unk w="conclusion"/> <unk w="made"/> during the next three months .
( FI ) Mr President , Commissioners , ladies and <unk w="gentlemen"/> , we <unk w="are"/> history behind us .
After all , our <unk w="transport"/> networks were built to meet the needs of the Cold War and for those political circumstances . Now they <unk w="have"/> improved and have been patched up here and there , but this has caused <unk w="us"/> a problem <unk w="and"/> we will have to return to again later <unk w="on"/> .
As <unk w="the"/> need for energy has grown dramatically while <unk w="the"/> economy has developed at a <unk w="faster"/> rate , so the price , supply and environmental problems have also changed .
As <unk w="the"/> problems are global , obviously global solutions are what are needed .
<unk w="it"/> is therefore <unk w="essential"/> <unk w="that"/> we <unk w="support"/> the United <unk w="states"/> and the developing countries in a common energy process .
We will show the way , but the <unk w="member"/> States has to follow Europe 's example and must work alongside <unk w="it"/> .
As energy solutions are global , we <unk w="need"/> European energy diplomacy , and I understand that the <unk w="need"/> for <unk w="europe"/> has done <unk w="such"/> a lot of work in that regard and in connection with this latest energy crisis .
We need energy <unk w=","/> for the simple reason that <unk w="we"/> <unk w="are"/> such big issues that there have been wars over them before and there will be again in the future .
It is also quite obvious that we need an energy mix comprising various energy sources that is as <unk w="much"/> based as possible , because that will stabilise the energy situation and as a result each nation 's diversity , and Europe 's too , will come into its own .
Of course , saving energy is an important solution to the <unk w="problem"/> : it is <unk w="the"/> cheapest and the most effective method .
For this we need something <unk w="which"/> I regard today as <unk w="the"/> most <unk w="important"/> single thing that should be done : making energy intelligent .
If we do not greatly increase the use of <unk w="information"/> technology we <unk w="will"/> not achieve our targets .
Luckily , smart <unk w="charges"/> has developed <unk w="not"/> just the same time .
Consequently , <unk w="information"/> and communication technologies ( ITC ) are the solution that will <unk w="help"/> us reach <unk w=","/> and keep us in order .
They are therefore like a good teacher , but also a <unk w="question"/> hired hand because intelligence is not just needed for the network , but <unk w="also"/> for equipment , homes and cars .
<unk w="if"/> there is human activity , intelligence is needed <unk w="to"/> control energy consumption .
In this connection , I would stress in <unk w="particular"/> the importance of the small and medium-sized enterprise sector and the innovations <unk w="which"/> come from this , as it can be truly inventive .
<unk w="i"/> find <unk w="it"/> odd that Ukraine is a transit country .
Obviously , as Mr Swoboda said , the <unk w="eu"/> should <unk w="be"/> under <unk w="crisis"/> management , for example under tripartite management <unk w="which"/> would include the EU , and that way the problem would go away .
Madam President , in all the discussions on <unk w="the"/> <unk w="bse"/> crisis , there is one aspect which my colleague , Anne Laperrouze , does mention , but which generally receives insufficient attention .
We talk about energy <unk w="policy"/> in the context of climate change and of fuel <unk w="management"/> , but <unk w="the"/> efficiency is also of huge strategic importance .
Controlling demand takes pressure off the supply side and <unk w="therefore"/> crucial to reaching energy independence in Europe .
I want to make two specific <unk w="points"/> in the context <unk w="of"/> the oral question on the use of information and communication technologies .
First , I am concerned that the roll-out of smart meters is not going ahead with <unk w="the"/> degree of commitment required by the Energy End-Use Efficiency and <unk w="the"/> Services Directive <unk w="is"/> called for in the Morgan report .
In some <unk w="cases"/> , digital displays are available to show consumers how <unk w="the"/> energy they are using - which is helpful - but a proper smart meter does much more than that .
<unk w="it"/> allows two-way communication , detailed <unk w="series"/> of consumer demand and proper measurement and payment of electricity <unk w="made"/> by micro-renewables .
They are crucial to the task of transforming buildings from being energy consumers into being <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> energy producers .
<unk w="however"/> , <unk w="with"/> regard to lighting , I trust we are <unk w="going"/> to <unk w="go"/> ahead <unk w=","/> taking the most inefficient domestic lighting off the market , and the same needs to happen for office and street lighting .
We should , however , already be looking forward to the next technological steps , such as wider use of smart lighting systems using sensors , which measure movement and the degree of natural light so that lighting can <unk w="be"/> reduced - or indeed switched <unk w="it"/> <unk w="is"/> necessary .
There is a lot more to energy-efficient lighting than compact fluorescents , and it <unk w="is"/> time for <unk w="the"/> public sector - and that includes the European institutions - to take the lead <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="need"/> for energy efficiency .
( LV ) Madam President , Commissioners , I would <unk w="also"/> like to thank Mrs Laperrouze for her extremely comprehensive report .
Crises always <unk w="have"/> the <unk w="need"/> to take important decisions that may crucially change our values and <unk w="values"/> .
I have reason to believe that <unk w="the"/> recent gas crisis has opened the eyes <unk w="of"/> politicians in relation to the vulnerability of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="citizens"/> of Europe <unk w=","/> <unk w="access"/> to energy supply .
Not <unk w="only"/> the recovery plan and the Second Strategic Energy Review prepared by the <unk w="commission"/> <unk w="and"/> also this report all give us hope that <unk w="there"/> will be a unified European energy policy , and that includes the hope that the isolated energy islands <unk w="in"/> Europe will at last be eliminated , including that <unk w="in"/> the Baltic States .
Another aspect <unk w="relating"/> to the development of liquefied natural gas terminals .
These could indeed become an alternative to supplies of Russian gas in many locations , but only on condition that national governments are able <unk w="to"/> withstand the pressure , and not create them as extra capacity for the export of Russian gas , but <unk w="also"/> as <unk w="a"/> terminals .
( DE ) Madam <unk w="president"/> , <unk w="mr"/> Piebalgs , Mrs Reding , <unk w="ladies"/> <unk w="and"/> gentlemen , we need investment now .
We are <unk w="on"/> the verge of an energy crisis and a financial crisis .
We <unk w="need"/> to make an effort to invest <unk w="more"/> quickly and as well as possible , and therefore we cannot but say ' yes ' to the construction not only of pipelines but also of LNG ships .
We should build <unk w="it"/> as quickly as possible , as this would create jobs and thus contribute to full employment in <unk w="europe"/> .
The pipelines should not compete <unk w="with"/> each other ; rather , the construction of each new pipeline is a win-win situation , as is <unk w="the"/> construction of LNG terminals .
Above all , we <unk w="have"/> to invest in energy efficiency , not via state funding , but rather by means <unk w="of"/> tax breaks .
If we could give every citizen an allowance of EUR 10 000 a year that they could <unk w="be"/> against tax , <unk w="we"/> could make an immediate start on investing in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="energy"/> and renewable energy ; with regard to the latter , progressive depreciation , in other words the immediate inclusion of costs on the balance sheet , would be a <unk w="very"/> valuable tool .
If <unk w="we"/> could set a three-year limit for this , it would be a great success for all of us .
We could get a <unk w="to"/> handle on employment and energy .
In this connection , it is up to Commissioner Kov√°cs to launch an <unk w="answer"/> .
One point which particularly exercises us in this programme is , quite naturally , the nuclear industry : it is vital to <unk w="improve"/> the safety <unk w="and"/> security of nuclear power stations , and to do so to the very best of our <unk w="minds"/> .
It is not possible <unk w="to"/> set the bar too high here : <unk w="quite"/> simply , we need people <unk w="our"/> trust in the European Union <unk w="and"/> the appropriate steps will be taken , that further security research <unk w="should"/> be conducted and that there will be legally binding <unk w="regulations"/> allowing dangerous <unk w="nuclear"/> power stations to be removed from the <unk w="cap"/> immediately following a ruling by a court or regulator .
The people of Europe have a right to safety in this field , so that we can go forward into a <unk w="new"/> <unk w="in"/> which <unk w="this"/> generation does not put us in danger and <unk w="who"/> can sleep soundly .
Ultimately , however , it will also be up to the Council , <unk w="but"/> the group responsible for <unk w="maritime"/> safety , <unk w="to"/> live up to their responsibilities and <unk w="not"/> to <unk w="continue"/> down a path that the citizens will not appreciate , by blocking proposals from the European Parliament and the <unk w="council"/> .
( ES ) Madam President , Commissioners , the <unk w="current"/> situation concerning <unk w="russia"/> and Ukraine and the gas <unk w="sector"/> has clearly shown that more than <unk w="ever"/> before we need to diversify our supply and improve connections between Member States and with producer countries .
The Commission 's <unk w="proposals"/> are heading in this direction , but in the interests of greater efficacy these proposals should also include , and I was glad to hear the Commissioner mention it today , the potential in the south of our continent and in particular in my country , Spain .
Spain is <unk w="a"/> Member <unk w="states"/> <unk w="have"/> the greatest diversification <unk w="of"/> <unk w="women"/> , both in <unk w="terms"/> of the number of countries - our gas is imported from 10 different countries - as well as in the range of formats .
For this reason , my country is an excellent supply platform for the <unk w="european"/> Union .
The supply is achieved both through the gas pipeline from Algeria as well as by liquefied natural gas in similar volumes to that of Nabucco , <unk w="or"/> at a lower cost and with better delivery times .
However this platform cannot currently be used by the <unk w="european"/> Union due to the lack of a connection to France .
Medgas , Mr Piebalgs , must be a priority for the European Union , as <unk w="to"/> the specific problems <unk w="of"/> our island <unk w="countries"/> .
If the Iberian peninsular clearly suffers from isolation in energy terms , islands such as the Balearic Islands , where I <unk w="come"/> from , suffer a double isolation .
This <unk w="is"/> very unfair for the inhabitants <unk w="of"/> these islands because <unk w="we"/> , as Europeans , have equal rights .
I sincerely request , Mr Piebalgs , that you consider the particular situation <unk w="of"/> island <unk w=","/> when taking decisions <unk w="on"/> establishing priorities .
Finally , I would like to <unk w="thank"/> <unk w="mrs"/> <unk w="thank"/> for her work .
( SV ) <unk w="mr"/> President , <unk w="commissioner"/> , the EU has had <unk w="to"/> learn the hard way what it <unk w="seems"/> <unk w="to"/> be far too dependent <unk w="on"/> a single energy supplier .
We <unk w="know"/> that Russia is ruthless when dealing <unk w="with"/> its neighbours , but when freezing <unk w=","/> and Bulgarians were taken hostage in the quarrel <unk w="of"/> Russia and Ukraine it was , hopefully , a wake-up call for all of us , including us here in this Parliament .
Ukraine needs the support of the <unk w="commission"/> , and the construction of Nabucco with gas from Azerbaijan , among others , must now get underway .
<unk w="the"/> EU must now demonstrate an ability to take action , precisely as <unk w="provided"/> for by Mr <unk w="jarzembowski"/> .
<unk w="we"/> know that Russia is pressing <unk w="the"/> Nord Stream , the gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea .
The Baltic Sea is one of our most sensitive <unk w="to"/> <unk w="areas"/> .
The <unk w="european"/> Parliament has also expressed its doubts about this <unk w="on"/> a previous occasion .
I am pleased to see that the report <unk w="says"/> that <unk w="renewable"/> energy needs to be an important part of Europe <unk w="'s"/> future energy mix .
If we are to meet the emissions reduction <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of the energy package we need modern <unk w="and"/> <unk w="renewable"/> energy .
It is <unk w="true"/> that we are <unk w="going"/> to discuss this in <unk w="the"/> European Parliament over the next few days .
( PL ) Madam President , Commissioners , it is time <unk w="to"/> speak plainly .
Firstly , the European Union does not <unk w="have"/> an energy strategy .
This fact encourages Russia , for example , which treats energy resources as a political weapon , to make attempts <unk w="under"/> pressure and blackmail , which makes the EU 's situation worse .
Secondly , the EU has succumbed <unk w="a"/> collective manipulation in <unk w="the"/> form of intimidation with global climate warming due to CO2 emissions .
Increasing numbers of experts and facts confirm that this is not <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
With regard to those who are spreading this theory and <unk w="help"/> us with global warming , it would be worth investigating in whose interests they are acting .
Thirdly , the EU requires an <unk w="overall"/> strategy based on the principle of <unk w="the"/> weakest link , <unk w="in"/> other words help in the form of financial aid and <unk w="also"/> in those countries which are <unk w="still"/> dependent on one <unk w="another"/> , like the Baltic States and Poland .
Fourthly , the EU needs to apologise and restore hard coal <unk w="and"/> brown <unk w="or"/> to favour , because it has plentiful supplies of these and they are cheap .
Fifthly , the EU needs a tax and credit policy to support new technologies <unk w=","/> savings in energy emissions , and this it does not have .
( DE ) <unk w="mr"/> President , ladies and gentlemen , <unk w="first"/> of all I would very much like to <unk w="congratulate"/> Mrs Laperrouze and Mr Piebalgs for all the documents they have <unk w="made"/> .
I do <unk w="not"/> agree <unk w="with"/> all of the details , but the proposals go in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="this"/> strategic direction : it is right and necessary to focus once <unk w="again"/> on the fact <unk w="that"/> <unk w="one"/> of <unk w="what"/> is <unk w="one"/> of the central issues .
We have perhaps devoted too <unk w="much"/> of our attention to other energy policy issues <unk w="in"/> the last year , and I am grateful that security of supply has now returned more to centre stage .
Secondly , I am also grateful that the proposed position is so <unk w="important"/> .
As has <unk w="been"/> <unk w="said"/> , one <unk w="does"/> not agree with every single point , but the report is generally correct , contrary to what Mr Turmes just suggested .
Mr Turmes , it is wrong <unk w="to"/> believe that there is a simple <unk w="reason"/> , a single answer to this enormous , complicated problem .
It is , unfortunately , damned <unk w="difficult"/> , which is why <unk w="the"/> answer is so <unk w="important"/> .
We cannot make people promises and act as if we have a solution and everything is magically going to be fine ; quite apart from anything else , the people would one day be bitterly disappointed when they realised that <unk w="it"/> <unk w="do"/> not work that way .
This nuance means <unk w="that"/> there is not <unk w="only"/> a single energy source , but <unk w="also"/> that we will continue for a long time to work with several sources .
It is part of the <unk w="problem"/> : not <unk w="a"/> whole solution , of course , <unk w="that"/> it should be <unk w="said"/> that it has a contribution to make .
I would also caution against staking too much on <unk w="this"/> : we have <unk w="just"/> heard a great deal <unk w="on"/> the dependency that entails .
I also think that we need to realise that we cannot <unk w="continue"/> carelessly give up on coal - an energy source <unk w="that"/> we have in our country and <unk w="in"/> many other places in Europe - and say ' <unk w="which"/> produces CO2 , so it is not an option ' .
As Mr R√ºbig just said , <unk w="there"/> is not one single answer for a pipeline : it would be a mistake <unk w="to"/> <unk w="to"/> opt <unk w="for"/> one ; instead , <unk w="we"/> need <unk w="to"/> open up a variety of routes and options .
Nobody today can predict with certainty what will happen in 10 , 20 or <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> years ' <unk w="time"/> .
In that respect , the path we need <unk w="to"/> take is to say ' yes ' to intelligent solutions .
By intelligent , I mean <unk w="that"/> , and being open to new things and not standing still .
It would be a fatal mistake - and it is one made in some energy policy decisions - to give those who actually have to <unk w="be"/> <unk w="their"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , namely companies , too little room for manoeuvre and too little support .
Does anybody really <unk w="think"/> that we , the <unk w="member"/> States , the State or the Community will be able <unk w="to"/> <unk w="solve"/> the problem of investment ?
No , it is the private sector that will have to <unk w="be"/> that .
( BG ) Madam President , Commissioners , first of all I would like to highlight the constructive debate <unk w="by"/> the Committee <unk w="on"/> Industry , Research and Energy on the report by <unk w="mr"/> Laperrouze , and especially <unk w="pointing"/> out her role in preparing an <unk w="integrated"/> and all-encompassing report .
I want to especially <unk w="focus"/> on the proposals included in the report which have been made with the aim of reflecting the problems faced by <unk w="third"/> countries which are most deeply affected by <unk w="the"/> <unk w="at"/> source suppliers , in particular gas .
First of all , the importance of the European Parliament actively participating in allocating projects for new <unk w="transport"/> links , in particular between Member States ' gas and energy supply networks , has been noted .
However , it is with <unk w="me"/> that I point out that only EUR 20 million has been set aside for the Commission 's project for the Republic of Bulgaria and its links with Greece , despite Bulgaria <unk w=","/> one of the most seriously affected countries .
<unk w="the"/> gas field in Chiren , for example , which will solve the problems <unk w="of"/> the crisis <unk w="with"/> minimum supplies , has not been mentioned at all .
Secondly , all possibilities for constructing the southern gas corridor have been included , in other words , in addition to the Nabucco project , the <unk w="gulf"/> Stream and TGI projects are also noted .
Also noted is the long-term plan <unk w="for"/> the possibility of gas <unk w="from"/> supplied <unk w="to"/> other countries in the region <unk w=","/> as Uzbekistan and Iran .
Thirdly , the importance of liquefied gas terminals being constructed in the European Union is emphasised , and also that they should be accessible to <unk w="the"/> Member States on the <unk w="basis"/> of the principle <unk w="of"/> solidarity .
This is once <unk w="more"/> particularly important for the joint use of such terminals by Bulgaria and Greece .
Fourthly , I call upon the Commission to look into expanding the energy community in <unk w="middle"/> East Europe and other neighbouring countries with the aim of <unk w="creating"/> a single <unk w="market"/> for the whole region .
As rapporteur on the regulations and conditions for access to gas supply networks , I want to once again underline the significance of the Third Energy <unk w="sector"/> for the formation of a <unk w="single"/> European energy market and to <unk w="make"/> its quickest possible implementation .
Finally , I want to <unk w="point"/> out that the report objectively expresses the role of nuclear energy too .
I consider <unk w="that"/> the current framework directive for nuclear safety will become a good basis for analysing <unk w="the"/> state of all reactors in the European <unk w="union"/> , and not just of newly-constructed <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , and will be an objective base for the evaluation <unk w="of"/> their safety .
It is clear that politically based decisions like those taken <unk w="in"/> relation to Kozloduy cannot be long-term ones in the <unk w="future"/> development of <unk w="cultural"/> diversity <unk w="within"/> the European Union .
- ( FR ) Madam <unk w="president"/> , Mrs Laperrouze 's report on energy policy concerns a subject of huge importance for all the countries of the Union .
I greatly respect her for the <unk w="work"/> she has done , but the situation remains very serious .
The <unk w="personal"/> and disastrous experience of our <unk w="countries"/> in the South in January , like the forecasts that threaten us with a significant energy shortage over the next two <unk w="years"/> , all point <unk w=":"/> the need for energy policy to be a key part of our foreign policy .
However , the future <unk w="is"/> gloomy , Commissioner , because we lack unanimity , solidarity and resources .
In terms of <unk w="transparency"/> , <unk w="it"/> does not perhaps apply <unk w="to"/> the Commission , but rather to certain large European countries .
I entirely agree <unk w="with"/> Mr Swoboda that Nabucco is a big embarrassment for the European Union .
<unk w="for"/> example , the Russian South Stream pipeline supported by the <unk w="commission"/> and by certain EU <unk w="countries"/> is in danger of ousting Nabucco , which is twice <unk w="as"/> cheap <unk w="and"/> which , for its part , acts <unk w="in"/> accordance with the rules <unk w="of"/> the market .
<unk w="these"/> sources of supply in Azerbaijan risk being <unk w="covered"/> by its rival , which makes it a precarious and dubious investment .
( HU ) Madam President , the <unk w="new"/> Strategic Energy Review could not be <unk w="very"/> timely .
The security of supply <unk w="in"/> the eastern half of the European Union has certainly been challenged by the events <unk w="at"/> the beginning of the year .
<unk w="as"/> a three-week crisis , since 20 January natural gas has once again <unk w="been"/> flowing to <unk w="us"/> , but the question is , for how long ?
In order to be able <unk w="not"/> to guarantee security of supply , <unk w="we"/> need to learn <unk w="the"/> lessons of the gas dispute .
By this I mean first <unk w="of"/> all the diversification of the energy <unk w="sector"/> used , the sources of supply and delivery routes .
According to calculations , Europe uses 500 billion m ¬≥ of gas per year , and this demand may grow , according to certain analyses , by as much as 30 % in <unk w="the"/> next 20 years .
The Nord <unk w="will"/> pipeline transporting Russian gas to Europe is <unk w="on"/> <unk w="european"/> construction , and the Blue Stream in Turkey is ready ; agreement has been reached by the interested parties on the building of South Stream , Ukraine has undertaken the creation of White Stream , and <unk w="that"/> <unk w="it"/> is the much talked-about Nabucco , albeit with uncertain sources or financial backing .
In any case , dependency <unk w="on"/> Russia will for the most part remain .
Although Nabucco would transport Asian gas , so far - unlike <unk w="it"/> - Europe has not even made an offer to <unk w="it"/> .
Many may say that , for the moment , we can trust that the negotiations of <unk w="the"/> European Commissioners and the Russian delegation at the Moscow summit will bring <unk w="about"/> results <unk w="and"/> <unk w="us"/> to significant progress as regards the gas <unk w="sector"/> , and that in future it will not be the Russian gas monopoly alone that dictates prices .
This is possible , but <unk w="for"/> my part , in addition to <unk w="doing"/> this - <unk w="and"/> indeed before all else - I believe that the way <unk w="forward"/> is to use less and cleaner energy .
This is precisely why I maintain that there is a need for a European green ' New Deal ' , in other words , one that aims at sustainable growth while stimulating <unk w="the"/> utilising innovation in environmental industry .
As a result of <unk w="the"/> current global financial crisis , more and more people are waking up <unk w="to"/> the <unk w="fact"/> that a new logic of <unk w="this"/> organisation is necessary .
Increasing numbers of <unk w="people"/> are <unk w="aware"/> that , in order <unk w="to"/> emerge from the global crisis , a fresh driving force is <unk w="concerned"/> , with an <unk w="additional"/> running on new organisational principles .
<unk w="what"/> <unk w=","/> more people are recognising the need for a paradigm shift .
The green ' New Deal ' , in other words a new logic for economic organisation based on innovations in environmental technology and supported <unk w="the"/> international capital markets , will become the cornerstone of increasing <unk w="coordination"/> of economic rescue and <unk w="educational"/> programmes , <unk w="especially"/> among the European Union Member <unk w="states"/> .
<unk w="we"/> need this stimulus because last year the number of the unemployed in Europe grew by 1.7 million .
<unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> ' New Deal ' , should <unk w="we"/> receive the green light , will have a <unk w="detrimental"/> effect on Europe 's future energy <unk w="policy"/> .
The Union 's dependence on imports of conventional sources of energy and on a limited number of suppliers represents a serious <unk w="alternative"/> to our security , stability and prosperity .
This strategic review of the <unk w="european"/> Union <unk w="'s"/> energy <unk w="policy"/> has therefore , in my <unk w="opinion"/> , come at the right time .
I am of the <unk w="opinion"/> that the ' three <unk w="'"/> 20 ' <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> for 2020 is correct from the security , <unk w="defence"/> and <unk w="the"/> standpoints .
<unk w="however"/> , attainment of this objective requires a common approach throughout the <unk w="new"/> European Union , unified both within the Union and towards the outside .
The creation of a common <unk w="audiovisual"/> policy requires the completion of ratification of the Lisbon Treaty and the submission of a proposal for such a common energy policy .
In the internal market there is a need for a clear and stable legal framework and , above all , a need to complete the integration of <unk w="the"/> energy systems throughout the territory of the European <unk w="union"/> .
<unk w="the"/> clause on mutual solidarity will remain just an empty phrase if we do not connect these energy <unk w="sources"/> .
There is also a need to strengthen <unk w="the"/> use of all domestic energy sources , from conservation by increasing the proportion of renewable sources to greater use of <unk w="the"/> nuclear <unk w="energy"/> .
There is no need to emphasise that <unk w="the"/> investment in our domestic energy industry <unk w="will"/> also provide a return <unk w="to"/> the form of a resumption of economic growth .
As far as external relations in the field of energy <unk w="and"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , this aspect too <unk w="is"/> far greater diversification than before .
There is a need for a <unk w="more"/> intensive dialogue with <unk w="third"/> countries , transit countries <unk w="and"/> other consumer countries .
<unk w="this"/> should be increased <unk w="by"/> the countries of the <unk w="middle"/> East , the Mediterranean region and North Africa .
<unk w="this"/> should be done within the framework of the Barcelona <unk w="process"/> : Union for the Mediterranean .
The dialogue should also include <unk w="a"/> candidate country Turkey and , in my <unk w="opinion"/> , <unk w="it"/> is also essential to look for a far more <unk w="balanced"/> approach to countries like Iran .
In conclusion I <unk w="would"/> like to congratulate our rapporteur Mrs Laperrouze on , I <unk w="hope"/> , a first-rate <unk w="and"/> balanced report .
( LT ) Although we started talking about the need for a common energy policy <unk w="as"/> far back as 2006 , each <unk w="of"/> <unk w="has"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="need"/> for ensuring a secure energy supply .
However , solidarity among the Member States is essential <unk w="for"/> the survival <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="eu"/> itself .
The EU must immediately adopt effective legislation to help overcome energy supply crises or avoid <unk w="it"/> altogether .
The Commission proposes an EU <unk w="of"/> Security <unk w="and"/> Solidarity Action <unk w="and"/> , the most important aspects of which are <unk w="the"/> creation <unk w="of"/> infrastructure and the diversification of energy sources .
I am delighted that among the infrastructure projects <unk w="relate"/> to <unk w="the"/> EU energy security priorities is <unk w="the"/> interconnection plan for the countries around the Baltic <unk w="states"/> , which would eliminate the insecure energy islands still existing in the EU .
I would like to ask the Commission for all kinds of support <unk w="for"/> the construction <unk w="of"/> the energy link between Lithuania and <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and the <unk w="most"/> <unk w="a"/> bridge .
Meanwhile , returning to the European Union 's fundamental principle - solidarity - and its application in the field <unk w="of"/> energy , many doubts arise as to the future of this principle .
We are debating the Third Energy Package , involving the creation of an <unk w="independent"/> internal electricity and gas market with an Agency for the <unk w="volume"/> of Energy Regulators .
At the same time , Germany and Russia <unk w="are"/> establishing a Russian-German energy <unk w="policy"/> .
How is this consistent with EU Member <unk w="state"/> solidarity , the common <unk w="fisheries"/> policy and <unk w="social"/> security ?
<unk w="thirdly"/> , Russia is <unk w="not"/> clearly using supplies of energy resources , and <unk w="for"/> gas , to exert a strong political <unk w="solution"/> .
Not only did the last gas conflict between Russia and Ukraine cause huge economic losses in many EU <unk w="countries"/> , but with a kind of permission from the EU it once again pushed Ukraine into a clear economic dependence on Russia .
For it is difficult to imagine that the <unk w="european"/> economy will be able to function if the price of <unk w="inflation"/> is over <unk w="eur"/> 400 per 1 000 cubic <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> .
Secondly , a new partnership agreement between the EU and Russia needs to be negotiated , which <unk w="will"/> contain details of the energy question but will <unk w="also"/> contain a clear stipulation that Russia will not use <unk w="the"/> supply <unk w="of"/> energy resources <unk w="and"/> exert political influence , and that Russian suppliers will be liable for damages arising <unk w="from"/> a <unk w="reduction"/> in supply .
Thirdly and finally , the European Union , by using its own financial means and also the European Investment Bank , should support first and foremost gas investments <unk w=","/> really <unk w="in"/> the supply of gas to the EU , and <unk w="something"/> which <unk w="have"/> a real capability to import gas from countries other <unk w="than"/> Russia , such as the Nabucco gas pipeline .
Madam President , we will never achieve either energy security or the 80 % reduction in our carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 if we continue to effectively ignore <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> issue of energy security and the critical importance of pan-European high-voltage direct current ( HVDC ) interconnection .
That includes an HVDC line to North <unk w="sea"/> : smart electrical networks over Europe and North Africa .
Having had <unk w="the"/> opportunity last week to experience first hand the exciting solar thermal operations in Grenada and Seville , and having read over the weekend Harvard professor Michael McElroy 's views on freeing the United <unk w="nations"/> from its <unk w="agenda"/> 750 <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> annual <unk w="report"/> for importing oil , winning the energy security battle in <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> and at the <unk w="top"/> <unk w="of"/> saving the planet , I ask myself : what are we still debating ?
The smart grid will allow solar , wind and hydro-generated electricity <unk w="and"/> level the security graph .
If the wind is not blowing off the Irish west coast , the sun will be shining in Spain , or the wind will be blowing off the west coast of North Africa <unk w="as"/> well as the sun shining there .
In short , what the sun is to Spain , <unk w="which"/> is to the west coast of <unk w="germany"/> .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> regulators will breathe easy as their only job as of now if to keep the lights on and our homes and offices heated <unk w="by"/> peak demand .
Wind energy is competitive <unk w=":"/> coal , oil <unk w="and"/> gas , and <unk w="the"/> fuel is free .
I conclude : the glib expression ' to cost the earth ' which we - English-language speakers anyway - use figuratively with gay abandon now needs to <unk w="be"/> taken literally .
If we do not rapidly change from our almost total dependence on fossil fuels , it will , as our <unk w="report"/> review <unk w=","/> <unk w="has"/> repeatedly <unk w="and"/> with increasing urgency point out , <unk w="and"/> <unk w="is"/> that : cost the earth through global warming .
( BG ) Madam President , as shadow rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs , I would like to congratulate Mrs Laperrouze on this report , which gives a wide perspective on the European Union 's problems in the field of energy , including the need for a <unk w="common"/> energy policy .
I also <unk w="welcome"/> the fact that <unk w="the"/> energy <unk w="has"/> found the <unk w="interest"/> it deserves in such a report , and is presented as a necessary energy <unk w="policy"/> .
In particular now , following the gas crisis , it is also clear and well pointed out <unk w="that"/> we have a need to diversify <unk w="energy"/> sources .
On the other hand , for the future we need to <unk w="be"/> working towards more <unk w="air"/> corridors , energy corridors , and not just one corridor at the expense of another .
In October last <unk w="year"/> I noticed here , in this House , that the Nabucco energy project was <unk w="called"/> ' <unk w="and"/> without fire ' .
I called upon the European Commission then to take firm <unk w="action"/> .
<unk w="i"/> can now say that noticeable action is being taken by <unk w="the"/> Commission <unk w="in"/> this direction .
<unk w="an"/> understanding of its importance is evident , particularly now following the gas crisis .
However <unk w=","/> needs to be clear that , despite the actions and measures taken on the road to <unk w="an"/> ever greater energy security , much more effort is needed , including serious political activity , so <unk w="that"/> we can see the <unk w="situation"/> at the end of the tunnel .
I would like <unk w="to"/> tell you that Bulgaria would have been doomed had it not had capacity for at least 20 days ' reserve supplies at the gas storage facility in Chiren , which last year , as if the <unk w="council"/> knew what was coming , was expanded by one-third of its capacity .
Therefore , for the second time <unk w="now"/> , I would stress my <unk w="the"/> lack of understanding why the Commission has <unk w="not"/> ignored the project proposed by Bulgaria for further expansion of this storage facility .
This was our only saviour and I think that we need to <unk w="conduct"/> similar projects in <unk w="the"/> other countries .
( PL ) Madam President , <unk w="the"/> gas crisis and the financial crisis are forcing us to take rapid and pragmatic action which is above individual interests and ideas that <unk w="are"/> economically unjustified , <unk w="such"/> as the Nord Stream pipeline .
The Second <unk w="nuclear"/> Energy Review does not give the desired added value .
A series of issues mentioned in the <unk w="human"/> face <unk w="of"/> difficulties in their realisation .
The citizens and <unk w="the"/> economy of the EU require rapid and specific decisions and action which will ensure relatively low and stable energy <unk w="effects"/> over the next 15 years : decisions which will lead <unk w="to"/> the most significant savings possible <unk w="within"/> industry , transport and homes ; decisions which will in large measure reduce <unk w="the"/> dependence <unk w="of"/> the EU economy <unk w="and"/> the import of hydrocarbons and ensure <unk w="the"/> correct supply ; decisions which will lead as quickly <unk w="as"/> possible to the development of a programme <unk w="a"/> plan of specific research-based measures <unk w="on"/> how to finance and implement them .
As a <unk w="result"/> of these economic measures CO2 emissions will be reduced , and the bureaucratic trading of emissions - so good for the <unk w="future"/> , but not for the economy - will not <unk w="be"/> necessary .
Madam <unk w="president"/> , I am touched by the words ' smart ' and ' intelligent ' , which are very much part of this <unk w="debate"/> , because the <unk w="commission"/> <unk w="should"/> try and use <unk w="all"/> our <unk w="resources"/> to reduce energy consumption are certainly not working <unk w="when"/> they are neither smart <unk w="nor"/> very intelligent .
I wish it <unk w="indeed"/> , as it would mean that I was in <unk w="writing"/> .
So we do need all of the things that others have spoken about : sensors and other technological advancements that will make everybody 's life easier in <unk w="terms"/> of achieving <unk w="the"/> energy efficiency objectives .
Tonight 's debate <unk w="is"/> a massive one : it <unk w="is"/> about our climate change agenda , security of supply , solidarity between Member States and also economic growth - and that is an issue for us at the moment - and how we can achieve a <unk w="better"/> use of our energy resources .
The country I come from , Ireland , relies <unk w="on"/> oil for almost 60 % of our energy needs <unk w=","/> it is all imported .
We need to reduce that dependency , we need to develop our <unk w="own"/> <unk w=","/> and , as I have already mentioned , improve our efficiency .
Clearly , the issue of interconnection between <unk w="member"/> States is crucial <unk w="that"/> for countries on <unk w="the"/> periphery .
Ireland 's dependency <unk w="is"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> : 91 % of our needs <unk w="are"/> imported .
That <unk w="is"/> quite a staggering percentage , and while we have not experienced the <unk w="enormous"/> problems that other colleagues have spoken about , or the cold <unk w="of"/> the horror that caused for other Member States , we <unk w="must"/> learn , from watching that , how critical it is that we do something about our energy mix and our energy insecurity .
So , all <unk w="of"/> the issues that are part of this report and the oral question are extremely important for us .
<unk w="in"/> particular the <unk w="issue"/> of land <unk w="policy"/> needs to be addressed .
The Swedish experience <unk w="of"/> forestries is interesting from the perspective of Ireland , where we have not <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> our forestry <unk w="policy"/> .
( PT ) <unk w="mr"/> President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , developing a coherent and all-encompassing Community policy in the energy <unk w="sector"/> is a logical step and a necessary intervention .
The Commission 's proposal and Mrs Laperrouze 's <unk w="view"/> <unk w="replied"/> in this direction .
Oil is finite and the production of <unk w="the"/> European Union <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> in 2007 contributed a mere 30 % to internal demand .
<unk w="the"/> European Union 's <unk w="emphasis"/> on oil imports indirectly increases our dependence on politically unstable countries or those which as <unk w="the"/> energy partners <unk w="and"/> major geostrategic tensions , as we have seen recently with Russia .
For these reasons , it is strategically <unk w="important"/> to redirect <unk w="the"/> demand for alternative energy sources to oil , but it is <unk w="also"/> geographically important to look more carefully at the South <unk w="africa"/> and <unk w="world"/> markets , which are currently expanding and to which the development of the European Union-Brazil and European <unk w="union"/> partnerships could contribute <unk w="to"/> .
This should be done through the use of the Iberian <unk w="peninsula"/> - <unk w="spain"/> and Portugal , where I come from - as a fundamental platform in terms of logistics and distribution in the European area .
As for the basic need to enhance energy efficiency , it is important to guarantee appropriate synergies among <unk w="those"/> able to <unk w="contribute"/> to greater energy efficiency .
Only <unk w="if"/> the adoption <unk w="of"/> a global and <unk w="integrated"/> approach between Community policies and national policies , namely in the areas of cohesion , agriculture and transport , will we be able to outline a <unk w="view"/> that conveys a long-term vision .
The link between energy and territorial cohesion is indisputable in that it affects <unk w="the"/> <unk w="common"/> solutions for all the regions of the European Union , including the most isolated <unk w="and"/> outermost regions .
( BG ) Mrs Laperrouze , I would like to congratulate you <unk w="in"/> particular for the good work you have done with your topical and timely report .
<unk w="we"/> are hardly in a position yet to <unk w="see"/> how much European countries and citizens <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> from the gas <unk w="sector"/> .
The direct losses to the Bulgarian economy <unk w="itself"/> , which was <unk w="not"/> severely affected by the dispute between Ukraine and Russia , <unk w="and"/> to over EUR 230 million , <unk w="without"/> any <unk w="case"/> .
<unk w="we"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> the situation <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> years ago , <unk w="and"/> the two <unk w="previous"/> <unk w="of"/> disagreed on prices .
Now we ask <unk w="ourselves"/> : are we ready for a single energy <unk w="policy"/> or will individual <unk w="interests"/> prevail in bilateral agreements ?
Have we done enough to interconnect the European gas supply networks among Member States or are we <unk w="more"/> <unk w="more"/> and less inclined <unk w="to"/> set aside <unk w=","/> for <unk w="such"/> situations ?
How are we <unk w="working"/> on Nord and South Stream , and on Nabucco ?
I am pleased to hear <unk w="that"/> nuclear energy is being treated on the same level as other <unk w="energy"/> sources .
We need nuclear energy and it would <unk w="be"/> as a serious barrier to <unk w="the"/> crises that may arise .
It is not coincidental that at the height of <unk w="the"/> crisis <unk w="the"/> Bulgarian Parliament asked its European <unk w="parliament"/> to revive the debate on reactivating the closed reactors at Kozloduy , which have been proved safe by the competent authorities .
The decisions are difficult , but let us not prejudge them or write them <unk w="to"/> prematurely .
I would like to address the <unk w="few"/> words to you , Mr Commissioner .
Only a few days ago , when the European Commission <unk w="made"/> resources from the European Development <unk w="fund"/> , the country which was worst affected received the least amount of resources .
This evening I have not heard <unk w="to"/> mention from you about Bulgaria being in the list of 100 % <unk w=","/> <unk w="those"/> in need of special assistance .
I would <unk w="therefore"/> <unk w="it"/> difficult to explain to Bulgarian and to European citizens .
Evidently <unk w="we"/> also need to put more effort into the <unk w="renewable"/> Energy Package <unk w=","/> <unk w="as"/> it <unk w="is"/> .
As a member of the Committee on Internal Market and <unk w="consumer"/> Protection , I have worked a <unk w="good"/> <unk w="report"/> on protecting energy supplies <unk w="by"/> consumers , but please understand , it is more important to secure the energy in the first place .
( RO ) I want to <unk w="make"/> the <unk w="european"/> Union 's need for an external energy policy so that the 27 Member States can speak with a single voice during negotiations with major <unk w="problems"/> .
This is the only way in which the European Union can obtain <unk w="market"/> prices for importing gas and <unk w="veal"/> , along with guaranteeing <unk w="social"/> security .
Diversification of energy supply sources must <unk w="be"/> one of the European Union <unk w="achieve"/> major goals .
However , I wish to draw your <unk w="attention"/> to <unk w="the"/> fact that the Russian gas pipeline project , South Stream , is not making any contribution at all <unk w="to"/> this diversification as the supply source remains exactly the same , Russia .
Furthermore , <unk w="the"/> huge costs involved in building this gas pipeline <unk w="and"/> end up increasing the price of gas , a price which European consumers would be obliged to pay .
This is why , in my <unk w="opinion"/> , the European Union needs to urgently take action to include <unk w="the"/> future <unk w="cooperation"/> with Russia and Ukraine some comprehensive clauses on energy interdependency , which will set out clear obligations and effective <unk w="measures"/> for rapidly resolving any problems .
The <unk w="accession"/> partnership between the European Union and Russia and the new Eastern Partnership should aim to implement ...
Madam President , energy <unk w="policy"/> and foreign policy <unk w="are"/> inextricably interlinked now more than ever .
<unk w="we"/> see <unk w="the"/> need for a common <unk w="european"/> energy policy in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="light"/> of <unk w="the"/> recent developments regarding gas supplies in central and eastern <unk w="europe"/> but , whilst it is one of the key innovations of the Lisbon Treaty , I regret to point out that this point was not highlighted sufficiently <unk w="by"/> <unk w="the"/> debates surrounding the Treaty 's ratification .
In <unk w="colombia"/> we <unk w="have"/> 12 days of gas supply <unk w="at"/> any one time .
Sixty <unk w="per"/> cent of our electricity is generated from imported gas , whereas the EU average is around 40 % .
On 28 January <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> , the Commission published a proposal to accelerate work <unk w="on"/> <unk w="the"/> deficits in the EU energy infrastructure while contributing to economic recovery as part of a EUR 5 <unk w="million"/> package .
It further emphasises that when all 27 Member States work together we can bring about the <unk w="possibility"/> that <unk w="is"/> required to ensure security of energy <unk w="policy"/> .
Madam President , the two important documents we are discussing today - the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> <unk w="action"/> plan of action and the report on it - <unk w="be"/> separated in time by <unk w="the"/> recent interruption of gas due to the usual winter quarrel between Russia and Ukraine .
Consequently , the report <unk w="is"/> more attuned <unk w="in"/> reality , trying to increase our internal solidarity and expedite <unk w="the"/> implementation of the plan in front of us , thus capitalising on the <unk w="basis"/> of the last <unk w="minute"/> .
Personally , apart from support for the <unk w="use"/> of transport routes for the import of gas , I consider the appeal to expedite the achievement of internal market energy in the current legislature and the necessity to revisit the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> problem of gas storage as major <unk w="sections"/> of the report .
However , <unk w="the"/> recommendation to fully open the Nabucco project to Russia <unk w="is"/> questionable since everyone knows that Nabucco was conceived as an alternative to Russian gas and that , consequently , <unk w="it"/> is already doing <unk w="everything"/> possible to kill it .
( SK ) Ladies and gentlemen , the recent gas crisis has <unk w="demonstrated"/> the importance of a common EU energy policy .
In addition , Slovakia has <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> out what 100 % dependence on Russian gas means .
Hundreds of companies had to cease production and pay their employees just 60 % <unk w="of"/> their wages .
I appreciate <unk w="that"/> solidarity plays a leading role in relations between EU Member States .
If we <unk w="have"/> not received an emergency transfer of gas from Germany through the <unk w="czech"/> Republic to Slovakia , households would also <unk w="have"/> been at risk .
I am convinced that <unk w="we"/> need to ensure a constant supply of energy is a fundamental universal priority .
We must build safe nuclear power plants <unk w=","/> at the same time , using structural funds , encourage rural communities to focus strategically on the link between energy , water and biotechnology , thus strengthening the diversification of the energy base .
( PL ) Madam President , the last but of <unk w="course"/> not the only gas supply crisis means that we keep coming back to the matter of security of <unk w="members"/> of this very important resource .
<unk w="in"/> Europe we are not in a bad situation as far as location is concerned .
We are almost surrounded by sources of gas : North <unk w="sea"/> , the Near East , Central Asia and <unk w="europe"/> .
<unk w="the"/> problem <unk w="is"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="it"/> does not have a unified market <unk w="for"/> gas .
In connection with this Europe does not have a more or less unified <unk w="state"/> .
I would like to point out <unk w="that"/> in the United States they do have a unified market , and the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> there for 1 000 cubic metres of gas is <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> USD 200 .
This is a result of the fact that we do not have an infrastructure which would enable the transfer of gas from one country to <unk w="another"/> .
It is <unk w="high"/> time that we gave this the right priority and engaged <unk w="in"/> financial <unk w="interests"/> so that it finally materialises .
<unk w="however"/> , Nabucco may become a hostage to the Turkey 's <unk w="own"/> <unk w="and"/> , as we have learned from Prime <unk w="minister"/> Erdoƒüan .
<unk w="are"/> we also considering , within the <unk w="existing"/> corridor , the White <unk w="paper"/> ( Caspian-Georgia-Black Sea-Ukraine-Romania ) <unk w="]"/> ?
Secondly , in the <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> Gas Directive , would you consider a mandatory 90 days of <unk w="time"/> for gas storage for all the Member States ?
<unk w="do"/> you foresee any <unk w="interest"/> to that in the Council ?
Because <unk w="it"/> has <unk w="proved"/> to be accepted in the Council : I <unk w="have"/> heard about four Member <unk w="states"/> objecting .
And how can the European Parliament , <unk w="we"/> <unk w="but"/> also to <unk w="do"/> it , help to pass it <unk w="as"/> quickly as possible ?
( RO ) The gas crisis which we recently faced <unk w="with"/> between Ukraine <unk w="and"/> Russia , but unfortunately it <unk w="is"/> some of the European Union Member States .
This <unk w="report"/> has highlighted once again that <unk w="the"/> European Union is dependent to a large <unk w="extent"/> on a single gas supply source .
As a result , I feel that developing <unk w="cooperation"/> with Russia is beneficial to the whole of the European Union , <unk w="and"/> at the same time , I believe that the European Union must immediately initiate projects which can allow alternative solutions to be found , with the precise aim of averting the consequences <unk w="of"/> crises which could occur either in the near or more distant future .
In the same <unk w="way"/> of thought , I believe that the two projects , Nabucco <unk w="and"/> South Stream , must be taken into consideration , along <unk w="with"/> <unk w="possible"/> solutions .
In this case , I am referring to <unk w="the"/> fields in the North Sea and those which are supposed to be on <unk w="the"/> Black Sea continental shelf .
<unk w="all"/> that , over time , <unk w="these"/> kinds of deposits are going to run out , I believe that we need to invest in scientific projects <unk w=","/> of discovering alternative sources of energy , <unk w="but"/> also <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="in"/> <unk w="the"/> future <unk w="too"/> .
( RO ) The recent gas crisis refocuses attention even more sharply on the importance of <unk w="the"/> alternative routes and sources of energy by developing transport infrastructures and establishing interconnections .
In the current climate , the Nabucco project <unk w="is"/> <unk w="to"/> be speeded up as it has <unk w="the"/> potential <unk w="to"/> help achieve the European <unk w="union"/> 's <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of diversifying not only <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , but especially supply sources from third countries .
Transit routes through neighbouring <unk w="countries"/> must be encouraged by completing the projects which involve connecting the network in Romania with those in Hungary and Bulgaria .
<unk w="at"/> the same time , I feel that the South Stream project cannot be regarded as being of any benefit to Europe , precisely due to the fact <unk w="that"/> it does not use an alternative source , as <unk w="stated"/> in the report 's <unk w="annual"/> review .
<unk w="the"/> micro-hydroelectric plant is not viable or effective , but hundreds of thousands of hydroelectric plants from <unk w="the"/> Alps right to the <unk w="country"/> or from the Balkans right to the Tatras or Pyrenees mean energy independence .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , this has been a really fascinating debate and has reflected all the diversity <unk w="of"/> views on energy and <unk w="the"/> importance that <unk w="this"/> issue deserves .
<unk w="but"/> I believe that the debate definitely shows that the rapporteur has struck <unk w="the"/> right <unk w="now"/> .
<unk w="it"/> is true that each of us <unk w="in"/> the detail <unk w="now"/> .
There are no simple solutions , no silver bullets <unk w="not"/> solve this .
<unk w="what"/> I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for <unk w="her"/> going through the <unk w="process"/> of ensuring that all <unk w="things"/> are reflected in the report , while at the <unk w="same"/> time clearly supporting the Commission 's second <unk w="nuclear"/> energy review .
Supergrid <unk w="is"/> the tool that was seen as a magical solution .
<unk w="however"/> , it is true that it has a lot of potential , but with a <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> we have a challenge .
Somebody needs to <unk w="be"/> <unk w="to"/> the grid , and , <unk w="as"/> you know , we are looking for a balance between affordability , <unk w="security"/> of supply and sustainability .
So , if we really want to move towards this supergrid , the recovery plan is <unk w="the"/> first small step in the <unk w="right"/> direction .
The <unk w="action"/> plan can lead to a vicious circle where we say : ' Well , we need this , we need that , but it should be done by industry ' .
Yes , we do also encourage industry with different types of incentives , but if the public funds and <unk w="public"/> funds <unk w="do"/> not follow in accordance <unk w="with"/> our political priorities , then the plan will not be successful .
On the third internal market package , I would just say what it does for <unk w="it"/> .
These two issues are crucially related to security of supply , while at the same time not taking away <unk w="national"/> sovereignty over energy .
If it is postponed , we will <unk w="have"/> a lot of momentum <unk w="and"/> security <unk w="and"/> supply .
So , in my opinion , the <unk w="action"/> plan and the third energy package is something that <unk w="needs"/> to <unk w="be"/> done .
The <unk w="main"/> questions are usually the ones I remember the best , so I will briefly respond to them , because they relate very clearly to the issues <unk w="we"/> <unk w="being"/> discussed .
One is whether we <unk w="can"/> give public funds to energy at all .
Well , a minority of countries still believes that it is <unk w="important"/> that the funding should <unk w="benefit"/> from industry , but this brings the problem that it is hard for industry to <unk w="carry"/> on very costly projects where returns are uncertain .
The <unk w="real"/> issue is ' a fair return for my country ' .
Well , I could point out that my country is not specifically <unk w="affected"/> by this recovery plan , so it <unk w="is"/> good that there were a lot of questions on this .
I explained that any <unk w="agreement"/> with <unk w="the"/> Baltic <unk w="as"/> a whole helps my country as well .
I <unk w="think"/> we are here <unk w=":"/> the first step towards European public funds supporting this type of development .
This could be the biggest difficulty , but I believe the Council <unk w="will"/> work hard really to approve of our proposal because I believe it is balanced , if <unk w="not"/> ideal for <unk w="the"/> <unk w="member"/> State .
On Nabucco , our preferred option is definitely transit <unk w="in"/> Turkey .
We are working now , we have started the intergovernmental conference with a view to concluding it in March with an intergovernmental agreement and a <unk w="full"/> support agreement .
That should give enough legal and regulatory clarity for investing <unk w="in"/> the Nabucco pipeline .
So there are <unk w="problems"/> , but <unk w="also"/> <unk w="is"/> our priority route and I think it is beneficial for Turkey as well .
As for gas storage , we are considering <unk w="this"/> , but 90 <unk w="%"/> should not be necessary for everyone , because it very much depends on <unk w="it"/> .
If a country produces gas it does not <unk w="reach"/> the same level of storage , so there should be a more fine-tuned proportion <unk w="and"/> gives enough security of supply <unk w="or"/> is <unk w="not"/> enough in case of <unk w="disease"/> .
Again I <unk w="would"/> like to <unk w="remind"/> you <unk w="this"/> this debate .
It was a very tough debate , but I believe that all elements <unk w="are"/> there and we just need to continue to <unk w="be"/> very vigorously to implement the ones that we have agreed on and <unk w="the"/> proposals that have been agreed in this House .
Again I would like to thank Parliament <unk w="for"/> its strong support for developing a <unk w="common"/> energy policy .
I agree that much , if not the majority , <unk w="if"/> the responsibility falls to our colleague who is responsible <unk w="for"/> energy .
However , everything that <unk w="we"/> have <unk w="been"/> calling for - energy <unk w="consumption"/> , <unk w="energy"/> efficiency , intelligent networks , decentralised networks , the supergrid , the micro grid , the <unk w="large"/> <unk w="of"/> plants - needs ICT to be run .
So it is essential that we make every effort <unk w="to"/> get this intelligent means , in order to put into <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="amendments"/> proposed by the committee on energy efficiency .
We are economically <unk w="very"/> technologically on <unk w="the"/> right path <unk w="and"/> it is also - and I must stress this - a unique business opportunity .
If <unk w="we"/> get the ICT to allow energy efficiency to go in the right direction , then we are creating many <unk w="times"/> , a lot of growth and <unk w="social"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
Only if we <unk w="are"/> , in practical terms , the possibilities shown to us by research , will we not only be less dependent because we will be more efficient , but we will also build a new industrial capacity .
<unk w="as"/> you know , we will be adopting the high-efficiency light-emitting diodes - the famous <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> - which , already today , will cut 30 % of energy consumption in lighting and up to 50 % by 2025 .
In <unk w="fact"/> , due to our European Framework Programme on Research , we delivered the OLEDs - <unk w="of"/> organic LEDs - with a supplementary efficiency of 50 % on the LEDs .
European research has brought about <unk w=","/> and it is now both <unk w="local"/> and regional <unk w="need"/> to put these results into practice .
I <unk w="have"/> heard some criticism that the euro recovery plan is <unk w="not"/> about efficiency .
Well , <unk w="when"/> I am reading <unk w="this"/> plan correctly , I see that EUR 1 billion is allocated to energy efficiency in buildings .
You have all pledged in this House that this is the <unk w="right"/> way to proceed .
EUR 5 billion <unk w="is"/> <unk w="to"/> clean cars , so that cars will no longer be dependent on petrol <unk w="than"/> they are today , and there is EUR 1 billion for smart manufacturing in order to use less time and less energy in our industries .
We are on the <unk w="same"/> path and I think that , with the help of Parliament <unk w=","/> with a lot of pushing in the national Member States , we will manage <unk w="not"/> only to secure <unk w="the"/> means but also to <unk w="the"/> <unk w="them"/> in practice .
Then energy efficiency will not only be <unk w="made"/> speeches but also about facts .
rapporteur . - ( <unk w="es"/> ) Mr President , Mrs Reding , Mr <unk w="president-in-office"/> , ladies and <unk w="gentlemen"/> , thank you <unk w="for"/> your exceptionally valuable contributions ; they <unk w="know"/> how vast this energy field is and that energy really <unk w="is"/> a <unk w="real"/> need .
In our debate and in the report , which moreover <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> the discussions that we have had among ourselves in the various political groups , I have noted a <unk w="few"/> <unk w="report"/> on the need to strengthen <unk w="the"/> networks and the interconnections , <unk w="to"/> use information and communication technologies to make the networks intelligent - as Mrs <unk w="peijs"/> just <unk w="said"/> - to strengthen relations with <unk w="third"/> countries and transit countries - that was in particular the aim <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="committee"/> on Foreign Affairs , with our <unk w="rapporteur"/> , Mr <unk w="costa"/> - and also to reach an agreement on energy efficiency , energy savings , and <unk w="the"/> development of <unk w="renewable"/> energies .
In <unk w="particular"/> , improving energy efficiency , developing renewable energies , diversifying our <unk w="view"/> and lines <unk w="of"/> supply , consolidating the dialogue with producer countries , but also ensuring that the 27 Member States speak <unk w="on"/> one <unk w="country"/> and , above <unk w="all"/> , that we effect a change in our lives is the consensus <unk w="that"/> we have achieved .
All these <unk w="berg"/> are vital ways to guarantee this <unk w="and"/> energy security <unk w=","/> we all <unk w="want"/> .
I should <unk w="like"/> to respond to my fellow Members <unk w="in"/> the Group of the <unk w="greens"/> / European Free Alliance and <unk w="parliament"/> also to other Members who have <unk w="come"/> out against <unk w="renewable"/> energy .
I believe that we have set some very ambitious targets for <unk w="this"/> .
Mention has been made of an 80 % reduction <unk w="in"/> CO2 emissions and of a 60 % share of renewable <unk w="energies"/> .
It <unk w="is"/> <unk w="therefore"/> <unk w="fact"/> that a large share has been allocated to all <unk w="the"/> <unk w="energy"/> sources .
In terms of nuclear energy , it is acknowledged in this report that it is part of the energy <unk w="sector"/> .
I should <unk w="like"/> to remind you that , in these <unk w="matters"/> that <unk w="have"/> been announced , we are talking about a 9 % share of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="%"/> , 54 % energy efficiency , 35 % renewables and 14 % geological <unk w="and"/> capture <unk w="and"/> storage .
Thus , nuclear energy is part of <unk w="the"/> mix , and coal too .
I for my part am not a fan of coal , I am not a <unk w="question"/> of nuclear , but we need <unk w="to"/> have the broadest possible range of energy sources .
I would not like to have to choose between coal and nuclear <unk w="and"/> 2050 .
<unk w="mr"/> <unk w="however"/> , <unk w="in"/> any case , that your energy is precious to Parliament .
The <unk w="debate"/> on <unk w="mr"/> Laperrouze 's report <unk w="will"/> take place tomorrow .
In accordance <unk w="with"/> Rule <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure , I have received one motion for a resolution at the end of the debate on the oral question by Mr Remek .
Solidarity between the European Union 's Member States in the energy sector must become a primary objective at European , <unk w="national"/> and bilateral level .
Indeed , the strategies adopted by each Member State at national level must not affect the <unk w="legal"/> interests of other Member States <unk w=","/> must be in the European Union 's general interest in terms of <unk w="social"/> security .
In this context , the task of improving the Community legislative framework aimed at energy interdependency <unk w="between"/> the EU and drafting a new <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> <unk w="of"/> regulatory acts intended to govern the European Union 's relations both with <unk w="the"/> suppliers <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="eu"/> and the transit states must act as an effective instrument in the process of drawing up a European security policy .
The new laws will have to provide for legal constraint mechanisms intended to consolidate cooperation in the <unk w="fisheries"/> sector and develop viable competition on the European energy markets .
It is essential <unk w="to"/> encourage the efforts aimed at increasing EU investments with regard to diversification of cross-border structures , incentives <unk w="are"/> generating <unk w="training"/> , non-conventional <unk w="incidence"/> of energy at local level and improvements <unk w="in"/> <unk w="the"/> infrastructure 's ability to facilitate connection to new energy sources .
The European Union must also seriously factor in the need to <unk w="use"/> the private energy sector in Member States , <unk w="which"/> is already <unk w="on"/> the consequences of the global economic crisis .
The more severe the winter the greater the certainty that the Russian Federation will turn off <unk w="the"/> gas supply to European <unk w="manufacturers"/> .
It is therefore all the more surprising , in the face of another gas conflict whose victims were <unk w="made"/> of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="third"/> countries , that Chancellor Angela Merkel is still pushing the proposal of building the <unk w="new"/> Stream gas pipeline with <unk w="community"/> funds .
What the European Commission should be doing <unk w="today"/> is preparing a plan for diversification of energy sources .
In one <unk w="of"/> the amendments which I tabled to the Laperrouze <unk w="and"/> <unk w="to"/> stress the significance of supporting ' the Nabucco gas pipeline , which is the only existing undertaking <unk w="which"/> will diversify energy sources and transit routes for gas ' without the involvement of Russia .
It should also be a priority to <unk w="verify"/> gas interconnectors enabling connections between systems and rapid transmission of gas reserves in the event of further crises .
However , our trade agreements should be based on the special ' energy security clause ' , which would be the <unk w="political"/> ethics of the sector .
<unk w="throughout"/> Europe and the rest of the world , which conduct business in a civilised manner , it is important that the Russian Federation ratifies the Energy Charter Treaty .
I think that only the cohesive and uncompromising position of a united <unk w="nations"/> will be <unk w="able"/> to persuade the Kremlin to make such a decision .
The gas crisis which the EU was confronted with in January <unk w="is"/> not the <unk w="day"/> in the history of the EU .
In Europe there are countries which are 100 % dependent on gas <unk w="from"/> Russia and these include Lithuania , which in December 2009 will shut down its nuclear power station .
<unk w="the"/> EU must take additional steps so that the crisis <unk w="is"/> not repeated .
The missing energy link must be created , and we must also strengthen the Directive on the security of gas supply and establish <unk w="an"/> EU coordinating <unk w="measures"/> designed to react to similar crises .
<unk w="it"/> is essential that there are sufficient reserves of energy <unk w="imported"/> in those Member States which are most dependent on energy supplies .
The crisis between Russia and Ukraine is not just a crisis of mutual trust , but a geopolitical <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> <unk w="criterion"/> .
Both countries must take responsibility for the fact that Member States <unk w="did"/> not receive gas .
Europe , for its part , must diversify energy sources and improve supply <unk w="policy"/> .
Europe must act decisively , as the solution of <unk w="the"/> energy crisis over <unk w="the"/> supply of gas from Russia is only temporary .
The EU must be ambitious in the battle against climate change , <unk w="which"/> means that the role of nuclear power and renewable energy sources cannot be <unk w="used"/> .
The process of creating a single market for electricity and natural <unk w="resources"/> must be <unk w="defined"/> .
It is <unk w="therefore"/> necessary to improve energy efficiency , especially in the new Member States .
In Romania , for example , there <unk w="is"/> huge potential for making savings and I would like <unk w="the"/> opportunity to be utilised .
I <unk w="welcome"/> the <unk w="commission"/> 's conclusion , including the point <unk w="of"/> signing an agreement between the EU , Russia and Ukraine .
However , I do not agree with the statement about <unk w="the"/> South Stream project being a vital project for the EU 's energy security to the same degree as Nabucco .
South <unk w="africa"/> is a rival project <unk w="for"/> <unk w=","/> and does <unk w="not"/> meet at all the needs to <unk w="make"/> energy supply sources in order to guarantee the EU 's energy security .
This is why I am <unk w="convinced"/> that in the future we need to <unk w="focus"/> more attention <unk w="to"/> the position given to <unk w="the"/> project in the various EP <unk w="areas"/> .
In the first few <unk w="years"/> of 2009 , EU Member States were treated as hostages by Ukraine , whose leaders initiated a supply settlement dispute with Moscow over the <unk w="age"/> of gas deliveries .
Kiev based its action on the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="process"/> , as a result <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> anti-Russian sentiment in Western and Eastern Europe , <unk w="it"/> would be <unk w="able"/> to gain the support of most EU Member States .
The EU needs to break out of <unk w="its"/> own vicious circle at last .
Just one part of this is the energy phobia according to which we need to put up with the Russians , or they will turn off the <unk w="european"/> tap .
If the European Union 's long-term goal is partnership <unk w="with"/> a Russia built on democracy , providing an enormous market which is developing and capable of further development , then it also <unk w="seems"/> to anticipate that the economic and political centres of gravity <unk w="will"/> legitimately shift to Russia .
The EU must actively and credibly convey <unk w="a"/> message that it is interested in seeing a modern Russia come into existence .
The lack of a <unk w="renewable"/> energy and foreign policy , squeezing the diversification of energy use into the <unk w="mediterranean"/> and prioritising certain historical <unk w="areas"/> and commercial advantages renders our Union vulnerable .
A united EU would give Moscow <unk w="a"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="opinion"/> , <unk w="and"/> it has never before seen such a thing .
In the face of countries engaging in capricious politics , however , an enormous country like Russia can easily <unk w="ignore"/> its will .
The <unk w="nuclear"/> Energy Review <unk w="gives"/> a good summary of all the steps that are indispensable <unk w="within"/> the European Union to reduce its dependence on external energy <unk w="policy"/> .
<unk w="we"/> <unk w="can"/> only agree with the need to <unk w="amend"/> the <unk w="new"/> regulation of gas reserves on new foundations .
In addition to imposing obligatory minimum stocks , it <unk w="is"/> important , <unk w="in"/> our view , to strengthen the mechanisms of <unk w="cooperation"/> with Community regulations , in harmony with the Lisbon Treaty .
<unk w="it"/> is commendable that the energy review <unk w="carried"/> out by the Commission names the infrastructures whose creation would be in the common interest of all Member States .
It is a welcome development <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="commission"/> <unk w="of"/> the interconnections of the Central and South-East European gas pipelines an important <unk w="step"/> in addition to <unk w="the"/> Southern Gas Corridor .
The significance <unk w="of"/> the initiative that was initially linked to <unk w="it"/> lies in the fact that the states involved will find <unk w="it"/> easier to assist one another rapidly in the event of disruptions to supply .
<unk w="but"/> the <unk w="commission"/> will also stimulate <unk w="competition"/> in the region .
What <unk w="is"/> less positive , however , is that the most vulnerable Member <unk w="states"/> are to receive a smaller portion of the financing for <unk w="the"/> infrastructure than they had wished .
However , the <unk w="financial"/> commitments can only be honoured by a more spectacular financial contribution and solidarity on the part of Community .
This old saying , none too complimentary to my compatriots , <unk w="it"/> <unk w="be"/> extended to cover the <unk w="entire"/> European Union .
<unk w="the"/> unpleasant experience of the Russo-Ukrainian gas conflict in January <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> was necessary for the question of energy security <unk w=","/> <unk w="is"/> a matter of <unk w="particular"/> importance for the entire European Community .
<unk w="we"/> cannot hide behind the fact that the Treaty of Lisbon , <unk w="what"/> does <unk w="not"/> <unk w="bring"/> about energy solidarity , has not <unk w="been"/> ratified .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="is"/> needed is the political will , supported by a <unk w="careful"/> analysis of the last crisis , in order to describe future scenarios <unk w=","/> to deliver the European Union from problems similar to those which <unk w="are"/> caused by the gas supply blockade via Ukraine .
Both the Commission communication and the Laperrouze report draw attention to ways of coping <unk w="with"/> emergency <unk w="measures"/> , such as increasing <unk w="competition"/> and creating a transmission network which will ensure technical availability .
It will be more <unk w="difficult"/> to agree a long-term strategy , which will have to include a <unk w="new"/> <unk w="debate"/> on Russia , because it is - currently - the main supplier <unk w="of"/> crude oil and gas to <unk w="europe"/> .
Mutual dependence , as we have <unk w="said"/> , does not guarantee continuity of supply and relations based on rational economic premises .
The <unk w="most"/> difficult thing in relations with our eastern neighbours <unk w="will"/> be to <unk w="stamp"/> out the tendency to make bilateral agreements , and that is the <unk w="only"/> measure of success or failure of Community energy security and energy solidarity policy !
I want to thank those who <unk w="have"/> the <unk w="commission"/> for their versatile efforts , and for bringing <unk w="together"/> is an important issue <unk w="at"/> the heart of the debate .
To guarantee energy security in Europe , the Union needs to invest in the <unk w="future"/> <unk w="of"/> a common main grid and a common energy market , and better coordination .
The report places too much emphasis on nuclear power as one of Europe 's major areas of investment in <unk w="the"/> future .
Considering the risks and <unk w="abuse"/> of <unk w="nuclear"/> power , this is a short-sighted and harmful policy .
A competitive Europe <unk w="depends"/> on <unk w="which"/> use must aim to increase the renewable energy share to <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> % by <unk w="the"/> year 2050 .
Many studies , including the German Aerospace Centre and the Heinrich-B√∂ll-Stiftung ERENE <unk w="parliament"/> , show that the effective introduction of new and clean forms of energy would be technically and economically <unk w="viable"/> .
Mrs Laperrouze 's report <unk w="is"/> <unk w="not"/> an issue that is particularly <unk w="important"/> to every European citizen , especially during the gas crisis which we faced recently .
We all need to make our contribution to successfully attaining <unk w="the"/> ambitious objectives which this Second Strategic Energy Review is proposing , namely <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> sustainability , competitiveness and security .
We <unk w="need"/> to support investments <unk w="in"/> infrastructure and <unk w="developing"/> new technologies with reduced energy consumption , so that we can successfully achieve the ' <unk w="enlarged"/> ' objectives .
Now more than ever , Member States must demonstrate their solidarity and cooperate in order <unk w="to"/> ensure the security of their energy reserves .
I would like to remind you of <unk w="the"/> geopolitical importance of Romania and the Black Sea region for energy security and diversification of energy supply resources .
- The next <unk w="step"/> is a short presentation of the report by Mr Schr√∂der , on behalf of the Committee on Development , on the <unk w="environmental"/> impact <unk w="of"/> Economic <unk w="trade"/> Agreements ( <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> ) .
' Economic partnership agreements ' really is <unk w="not"/> a mouthful , particularly in German .
<unk w="the"/> Cotonou Agreement states <unk w="that"/> economic partnership agreements <unk w="can"/> be concluded between the European Union and the <unk w="eu"/> ( <unk w="former"/> , Caribbean <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> ) States by the end of 2007 .
The background to this <unk w="is"/> that developing countries that were not , and are not , in the ACP Group of States <unk w="and"/> to the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) that the European Union was according the ACP States special privileges .
We have now <unk w="agreed"/> to set up , at least in part of the Caribbean , an economic partnership agreement of this type , which we hope will be a success .
<unk w="this"/> report <unk w="suggests"/> that this agreement will form a new basis for development cooperation : we are helping them to help themselves .
There has , of <unk w="course"/> , been a certain amount of friction , in particular here in Parliament between our committee , the Committee on Regional Development , <unk w="and"/> the Committee on International Trade , relating primarily <unk w="to"/> the compatibility of this agreement <unk w="and"/> the rules of <unk w="the"/> WTO and especially the issue of parliamentary <unk w="control"/> .
My report originally included two <unk w="points"/> - numbers 5 <unk w="and"/> 17 - relating to parliamentary scrutiny .
At the <unk w="moment"/> and on the advice of the chairman of the Committee on International Trade , I deleted both of those paragraphs completely and submitted an <unk w="annual"/> draft report with these paragraphs deleted , on which we will be voting on Thursday .
It sets <unk w="out"/> both the opportunities and the risks of the <unk w="euro-mediterranean"/> partnership agreements , but it particularly emphasises the <unk w="very"/> positive effects of these agreements on the people in those countries .
Before I <unk w="conclude"/> , <unk w="mr"/> President , I would just like to say one more <unk w="point"/> : some of our fellow Members have repeatedly claimed that people in the ACP States had too little time to conclude these agreements .
That is not true : <unk w="we"/> had from 2000 to 2007 ; then they had another year until 2008 ; and we still have time .
We are not , however , saying to people in these countries that they <unk w="can"/> do it <unk w="when"/> they like : time is running out .
It is <unk w="in"/> the interests of <unk w="the"/> people in the ACP States , and I therefore call on all Members of this House to vote in favour <unk w="of"/> my report on Thursday , including those who originally intended to vote against it .
This is not an argument between the left and <unk w="the"/> right ; it is about <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> in the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="sector"/> to become more self-confident and , in <unk w="the"/> foreseeable future , to become equal partners in international trade .
These interim <unk w="agreements"/> provide for a trade regime compatible with WTO rules and preserve important trade <unk w="unions"/> for <unk w="third"/> countries .
The interim agreements are only <unk w="different"/> in nature , as they will be replaced by full regional EPAs .
The pace of these negotiations <unk w="can"/> be set by the regions concerned <unk w="to"/> ensure those objectives and coverage match their own integration processes , capacity , needs and political priorities .
<unk w="in"/> parallel , the programming of the 10th <unk w="european"/> Development Fund has moved on .
In anticipation of the EPAs , these programmes include considerable support to help our African , Caribbean and Pacific ( ACP ) partners make the most of the <unk w="markets"/> : direct support for the <unk w="implementation"/> of the agreements and indirect support <unk w="to"/> build up <unk w="innovations"/> and productive capacity .
At the same time we welcome the fact that the report acknowledges that <unk w="rural"/> development <unk w="policy"/> and outcomes of the agreements <unk w="is"/> a much wider issue than just financial support .
We also recognise the essential role of reform in the ACP regions in reaching <unk w="its"/> development objectives , as set out in paragraph 14 <unk w="of"/> the report .
The reforms offset shifts <unk w="on"/> the tax base due to liberalisation and are <unk w="making"/> themselves valuable steps to ensuring sustainable public financing in the ACP .
Another <unk w="political"/> objective is to support regional economic integration in the ACP .
This is exactly why these agreements <unk w="are"/> only temporary <unk w="or"/> full <unk w="employment"/> .
Building up supply-side capacity to trade and engage in goods and service sectors <unk w="and"/> the economic value of a trade agreement .
However , we do acknowledge that protection - the legitimate use of measures to <unk w="the"/> sensitive sectors and emerging industry - is a valid and essential policy tool .
This is why the EPAs contain all sorts of <unk w="confusion"/> , and in particular exclusions and asymmetrical commitments for the ACP side , <unk w="which"/> called for in the report .
On the EU <unk w="side"/> , our markets are completely open for ACP <unk w="countries"/> , with increased <unk w="regard"/> to <unk w="the"/> technical and health standards and facilitate <unk w="this"/> .
ACP countries will only open their markets <unk w="first"/> , with the possibility to maintain exceptions .
The Commission does not see our <unk w="opposition"/> to the EPA process <unk w="going"/> on signature .
This is the start of a process of enhanced dialogue , careful implementation , <unk w="methods"/> , and evaluation of the effect , <unk w="especially"/> as regards the development impact .
The Commission therefore welcomes the report by Mr Schr√∂der and will provide a detailed reaction to the points <unk w="made"/> in due course .
<unk w="in"/> writing . - ( FR ) On <unk w="this"/> Parliament will give its verdict on Mr Schr√∂der 's report on Economic Partnership Agreements ( EPAs ) .
I would be extremely disappointed if our <unk w="parliament"/> 's first vote on this <unk w=","/> very technical and highly political subject ( <unk w="to"/> the whole future of our relations with the ACP States is at <unk w="present"/> ) were to result in the adoption of Mr Schr√∂der <unk w="'s"/> report .
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament will not vote in favour of this <unk w="report"/> , since it <unk w="in"/> no way reflects the concerns both of Europeans and <unk w="to"/> our ACP partners about the EPAs and the way in <unk w="which"/> they are negotiated .
In contrast to <unk w="the"/> rapporteur <unk w="'s"/> position , the PSE Group has tabled and will vote in favour of a motion for a resolution which puts development back at the heart of the EPAs ' priorities , which rejects the liberalisation of public services and any negotiation on the Singapore issues <unk w="and"/> on services against the <unk w="member"/> States ' wishes , which promotes regional integration , <unk w="and"/> <unk w="need"/> for huge financial support <unk w="to"/> bring the <unk w="member"/> States ' economies up to standard , and <unk w="it"/> takes account of the specific characteristics and fragilities of these countries , be they least <unk w="developed"/> countries or otherwise .
These <unk w="are"/> the conditions that would make <unk w="it"/> EPAs acceptable agreements .
<unk w="but"/> we are still a long way <unk w="preventing"/> from them .
- The next item is a short <unk w="debate"/> <unk w="of"/> the report by Mr Hegyi , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , <unk w="and"/> wilderness in Europe .
Around 46 % of the <unk w="country"/> 's land mass can be considered a natural environment , a wilderness untouched by human <unk w="beings"/> .
In Europe , however , wilderness makes up only 1 % of <unk w="the"/> entire territory .
We must <unk w="do"/> everything we can to ensure that at <unk w="least"/> the <unk w="european"/> wilderness , this 1 % , is <unk w="crucial"/> for the sake of future generations .
This is the aim of my report , <unk w="and"/> I hope that increased protection <unk w="and"/> wilderness <unk w=","/> will sooner <unk w="or"/> later be integrated into EU legislation .
There <unk w="is"/> a <unk w="new"/> perception of wilderness in European culture .
On the one hand , <unk w="it"/> is <unk w="just"/> as a place to fear and avoid , where monsters and unknown dangers lie in wait for us , as is <unk w="happening"/> in many folk <unk w="areas"/> .
On the other hand , it is seen as an attractive , pleasant <unk w="one"/> that gives us temporary refuge from <unk w="the"/> stress of <unk w="commercial"/> and industrial civilisation .
English-language literature on the topic makes a distinction between the concept of conservation , that <unk w="is"/> , the proper use of nature , and of preservation , in other words the protection of nature from <unk w="the"/> human use .
<unk w="these"/> philosophical debates lie beyond the scope of my report , but for the record I would <unk w="like"/> to point out <unk w="that"/> I consider sustainable development to be the ideal solution .
The wilderness cannot <unk w="be"/> locked up in a bank safety deposit box , like a necklace or a package <unk w="of"/> share certificates .
<unk w="but"/> we must protect nature , but by means of human use .
<unk w="the"/> territory of Europe is too small to have zones that are off-limits to its citizens .
Discovering nature and encountering conditions experienced by humanity before civilisation teaches respect <unk w="for"/> nature and can serve as <unk w="the"/> basis for high-quality tourism .
At the same <unk w="time"/> , these areas are extremely vulnerable to environmental changes caused by human beings - for instance as a result of motorisation , chemicals and climate change - and to the appearance of alien plant and animal species .
We need to be careful <unk w="when"/> visitors do <unk w="not"/> endanger the <unk w="union"/> , and therefore all forms of tourism should be placed under the oversight of conservation experts .
The <unk w="promotion"/> of sustainable tourism should be <unk w="compatible"/> with the protection of these <unk w="women"/> , and all proceeds should be devoted to wilderness protection .
The wilderness is a refuge for many species , such as the brown bear , the wolf and the lynx , which are <unk w="unable"/> to survive under even slightly altered conditions .
There are <unk w="so"/> many species <unk w="of"/> <unk w="countries"/> that are waiting to <unk w="have"/> discovered and described .
Most <unk w="of"/> these <unk w="countries"/> in the soil or in rotting timber and are highly sensitive to changes .
<unk w="such"/> zones are <unk w="a"/> part of the Natura 2000 network , but they <unk w="are"/> stricter <unk w="control"/> .
My report therefore calls upon the European Commission to work with <unk w="the"/> Member States to map the remaining wilderness regions in Europe and develop a strategy for their <unk w="social"/> protection .
The natural values of the still-untouched areas and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="lack"/> of <unk w="natural"/> habitats should be determined , and <unk w="the"/> further protection <unk w="must"/> be ensured .
Experts have advised me that we <unk w="do"/> not think in terms of new legislation , but rather introduce more specific and stricter protection for wilderness zones within the Natura 2000 <unk w="community"/> .
Since the financing of Natura 2000 is at any rate contradictory , and the source of much <unk w="more"/> <unk w="energy"/> , we <unk w="have"/> in any case have to make changes to <unk w="the"/> relevant regulations in the <unk w="european"/> parliamentary cycle but at the latest in the new budget .
This could also be a good opportunity <unk w="for"/> the legal definition and enhanced protection of wilderness .
An area <unk w="in"/> my own <unk w="country"/> , the dripstone cave of Aggtelek , is also <unk w="such"/> as wilderness .
I would be <unk w="very"/> happy if <unk w="you"/> and <unk w="the"/> conservationists could successfully collaborate to develop a Protected Area Network ( PAN ) <unk w="]"/> , since the network of PAN <unk w=","/> has developed a successful European-wide system of wilderness protection .
It is quite literally a <unk w="word"/> about the future of life <unk w="and"/> Earth .
But , despite <unk w="the"/> fundamental <unk w="nature"/> of <unk w="human"/> biodiversity , progress <unk w="to"/> date has been limited .
Despite the positive developments <unk w="that"/> have <unk w="been"/> made in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="case"/> - for instance the Natura 2000 network - the EU 's biodiversity is still <unk w="under"/> continuous pressure <unk w="due"/> to habitat destruction , pollution , <unk w="climate"/> change and the impact of invasive species .
The Commission 's conclusion was that we are highly unlikely to <unk w="achieve"/> our <unk w="ambitious"/> target of halting biodiversity decline - <unk w="and"/> that further intensive efforts will be required , both <unk w="in"/> Member State and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="commission"/> .
Against this background , the Commission welcomes the consistent support that Parliament has <unk w="made"/> to efforts <unk w="to"/> protect Europe 's rich and <unk w="our"/> natural heritage .
We <unk w="therefore"/> welcome the <unk w="report"/> of Mr Hegyi <unk w="in"/> producing this important resolution <unk w="on"/> wilderness in Europe .
I would like to start by making the general observation that many <unk w="of"/> the issues highlighted in the report are <unk w="now"/> being followed up by <unk w="the"/> Commission .
For example , <unk w="in"/> <unk w="in"/> 2008 , the Commission adopted a communication , ' <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> an EU Strategy on Invasive Species ' .
Issues such as improving implementation and the relationship between biodiversity <unk w="and"/> climate change must be explicitly considered .
It is also important <unk w="to"/> add one clarification <unk w="of"/> the report .
There is an ongoing assessment of the effectiveness of our nature legislation - the so-called Article 17 reports - <unk w="and"/> there are currently no <unk w="need"/> to amend our legislation , and <unk w="the"/> main focus <unk w="is"/> on more effective implementation .
Turning to the subject of wilderness , Europe is densely populated and <unk w="even"/> 1-2 % of <unk w="european"/> territory has not been affected by human <unk w="rights"/> .
<unk w="but"/> while these wilderness areas are <unk w="not"/> in area , they <unk w="are"/> of high value in both scientific and cultural terms .
They can even , as is the case in the <unk w="case"/> trans-border National Park of the German Bavarian and Czech Bohemian forests , be a symbol for European cooperation and integration .
Most <unk w="of"/> these areas are already a part <unk w="of"/> the Natura 2000 network .
However , this report provides the inspiration to look again at the wild and nearly wild areas in <unk w="the"/> EU and to see if there are instances where additional European actions can help protect these <unk w="public"/> places .
A conference will take place in Prague <unk w="in"/> May 2009 .
This Conference will offer a <unk w="view"/> to <unk w="all"/> the issues related to wilderness areas in Europe and identify measures <unk w="designed"/> to ensure their conservation .
Let <unk w="me"/> conclude by confirming that the Commission recognises that Europe 's landscape is the <unk w="result"/> of a long process of human intervention .
We certainly do not intend to re-convert our existing landscapes into wild nature , but we need to publicly <unk w="restrict"/> ourselves to <unk w="be"/> the last remaining wild areas of Europe .
It represents a very welcome input into the <unk w="intergovernmental"/> conference .
Mr President , on a point of order , I would <unk w="like"/> to protest <unk w="at"/> the overuse and the increasingly liberal use of Rule 45 ( 2 ) under which these most important debates are taken .
I rise at this point because I particularly would have liked to have spoken <unk w="about"/> the <unk w="question"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="in"/> Mr <unk w="galeote"/> 's report and indeed I have colleagues coming on on subjects which are not discussed in my main committee and other colleagues ' main committees , and I am being denied the right to contribute toward <unk w="this"/> in plenary .
In the PPE-DE Group we had a very vexed and heated argument <unk w="both"/> at working group and group level last week on the number of Rule 45 ( 2 ) items on our <unk w="agenda"/> this week .
I really <unk w="cannot"/> feel we need to urgently <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> this rule .
I <unk w="think"/> it is a rule <unk w="that"/> <unk w="is"/> set by Parliament and the Members themselves signed off on , but our good will , I <unk w="believe"/> , is being abused by the number of points on our <unk w="part"/> - the most important <unk w="report"/> on <unk w="the"/> <unk w="occasion"/> - that we are being increasingly disallowed to debate .
- Mrs Doyle , we will obviously gladly take note of your statement , but I would remind you that the use of Rule 45 is in the hands of the Conference of Presidents and that , within the latter , <unk w="there"/> are weighted , <unk w="that"/> is to say that the large groups , and your own <unk w="member"/> <unk w="too"/> , have a huge amount of power to decide on <unk w="what"/> should be allowed in plenary under such-and-such a rule .
I am a bit like you ; I must say that we <unk w="have"/> perhaps gone <unk w="into"/> a <unk w="matter"/> of being too tolerant to one of being too strict and that <unk w="it"/> <unk w="is"/> <unk w="is"/> definitely somewhere in between .
<unk w="i"/> should <unk w="also"/> refer to your group chairmen , ladies and <unk w="gentlemen"/> .
in writing . I was shadow rapporteur on this report on ' <unk w="colombia"/> in Europe ' and I would like to congratulate my colleague , Mr Gyula Hegyi , on his work .
First of all , <unk w="we"/> really need to proceed with the mapping of the last wilderness areas in Europe .
<unk w="in"/> <unk w="however"/> , this cannot be done without defining ' wilderness ' , therefore I urge the European Commission to take action in this field .
Secondly , I wish to speak <unk w="on"/> the key issue of this report , namely human presence and tourism .
Human presence should not be excluded ; on the contrary , people have to be introduced to the <unk w="internal"/> beauties of their country in order to preserve <unk w="them"/> better .
Therefore I join the request of the main <unk w="groups"/> in <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> and ask the European Commission to give some guidelines for <unk w="their"/> preservation in <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> .
I personally perceive wilderness as areas undisturbed <unk w="the"/> human <unk w="tragedy"/> , where natural processes are dominant .
On <unk w="the"/> other hand , I agree that sustainable tourism , if done properly , can provide an economic incentive for local communities to conserve the natural and cultural heritage .
But the increase in demand for wilderness tourism puts pressure <unk w="on"/> the very same values that the tourists <unk w="are"/> seeking <unk w="peace"/> can speed up the destruction of <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> ecosystems .
A solution would be <unk w="to"/> open a limited part of wilderness areas to high-quality sustainable <unk w="development"/> , which <unk w="does"/> not adversely affect the conservation objectives of the <unk w="directive"/> .
Tourism activities should be allowed under strict conditions , <unk w="to"/> <unk w="in"/> a limited number <unk w="of"/> tourists per day , and on the basis of a solid sustainable tourism plan that <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> conservation initiatives and promotes a <unk w="new"/> experience of wilderness .
The tourism plans and the activities of the operators should be evaluated by means <unk w="of"/> thorough <unk w="implementation"/> mechanisms , especially designed for wilderness areas .
<unk w="the"/> aim <unk w="is"/> to make tourists and operators <unk w="in"/> <unk w="that"/> wilderness entails not only freedom but also responsibility .
<unk w="in"/> this respect , Romania is <unk w="one"/> of the countries which possess a significant amount and variety of flora and fauna .
Consequently , the Commission <unk w="to"/> allocate larger sums <unk w="to"/> the Fund for Rural Development <unk w="and"/> environmental protection projects in the <unk w="european"/> agricultural sector , with a clear aim of financing wilderness <unk w="research"/> activities .
On the other hand , the <unk w="european"/> Commission should introduce a set of clear rules for providing financial support to local community projects in the vicinity of these areas , which allow controlled forms of tourism in the areas intended for conservation <unk w="to"/> generate economic benefits which can be enjoyed by the <unk w="various"/> local communities .
Europe 's biodiversity is the most precious legacy which we can leave future <unk w="now"/> .
I welcome <unk w="and"/> support this <unk w="report"/> <unk w="in"/> Europe 's wilderness areas .
I would like to draw attention to the alarming state of <unk w="the"/> area with <unk w="the"/> richest biodiversity in Europe , the Danube Delta .
The Delta is being constantly subjected to acts of aggression from poaching , <unk w="of"/> economic interests and , last but not least , <unk w="on"/> tourism .
One of <unk w="the"/> biggest sources of aggression affecting <unk w="human"/> Delta is rooted <unk w="in"/> the lack of awareness of the Delta 's populations and of rural populations living along the Danube 's tributaries flowing through Romania .
I would like to take this opportunity to call on the Commission and the Council , based on <unk w="this"/> report , to consider as <unk w="much"/> as possible specific measures aimed at : <unk w="setting"/> up a working party to examine <unk w="the"/> situation of the Danube Delta , <unk w="the"/> effective educational programmes about the <unk w="measures"/> targeted at the populations with a <unk w="significant"/> impact on the area 's biodiversity , and establishing biodiversity protection <unk w=")"/> .
At the same time , <unk w="the"/> conservation <unk w="in"/> the European Union , especially in the Danube Delta <unk w="process"/> , cannot <unk w="be"/> achieved without applying similar <unk w="conditions"/> in the countries neighbouring the EU .
Therefore , I urge the Commission <unk w="and"/> the Council to step up their dialogue and <unk w="a"/> <unk w="capable"/> of specific <unk w="activities"/> as part of <unk w="our"/> relations <unk w="with"/> these countries .
<unk w="bearing"/> in mind that it will not <unk w="be"/> possible to meet the <unk w="commitments"/> made in 2007 by adopting the resolution on halting the loss of biodiversity by 2010 , the protection of wilderness areas through promotion , development and financing <unk w="research"/> is becoming a priority in the <unk w="framework"/> of climate change and the negative impact of tourism .
The proposal to <unk w="create"/> a system for mapping Europe <unk w=","/> wilderness would help identify biodiversity and <unk w="in"/> areas which will <unk w="focus"/> more attention and a significant effort on the part of Member States <unk w="in"/> order to protect them .
Information campaigns <unk w="aimed"/> at raising the general public 's awareness of wilderness areas , the <unk w="development"/> of <unk w="the"/> sustainable tourism and the <unk w="protection"/> of the Birds and Habitats Directives <unk w=","/> just some of the instruments which will <unk w="help"/> us protect these areas .
There are <unk w="also"/> <unk w="and"/> national parks in Europe , including Retezat National <unk w="assembly"/> in Romania .
<unk w="the"/> parks are part of the Protected Area Network ( PAN ) .
This network is responsible for <unk w="the"/> wilderness <unk w="process"/> and brings together all the national authorities <unk w="and"/> local tourism <unk w="are"/> involved in ensuring the sustainable development of tourism .
The European Commission should support this initiative and <unk w="to"/> <unk w="to"/> this network with a view to exchanging information and good <unk w="practices"/> .
- The next item is a short presentation of the <unk w="report"/> by Mr Queir√≥ , on behalf of the Committee on <unk w="transport"/> and Tourism , on an agenda for sustainable future in general and business aviation .
Mr President , Commissioner , until now the general and business aviation <unk w="industry"/> has not been addressed specifically at <unk w="european"/> level .
The political significance of this <unk w="directive"/> therefore derives from <unk w="the"/> fact that this is the first time that the Commission and Parliament have examined this activity , at a time when it is recording accelerated growth both in volume and in economic importance .
The numbers <unk w="which"/> <unk w="women"/> themselves : in business aviation alone , <unk w="small"/> and medium-sized enterprises working in this field are multiplying , the number <unk w="of"/> aircraft is expected to <unk w="rise"/> to 3 500 in the next decade and annual turnover amounts <unk w="to"/> more than <unk w="eur"/> 25 billion .
Directly <unk w="or"/> indirectly , it <unk w="is"/> 154 000 jobs across Europe .
Together with general aviation , where it is calculated that <unk w="there"/> are between 30 000 and 50 000 aircraft , the sector represents around 9 % of all recorded air traffic and boasts the fastest growth in Europe , twice as high as that of all other traffic .
The business aviation segment offers important social and economic benefits : by providing flexible point-to-point transportation it increases citizens ' mobility , companies ' productivity <unk w="and"/> regional cohesion .
<unk w="the"/> general aviation sector provides essential services in very diverse areas , from search-and-rescue aviation to firefighting , traffic <unk w="management"/> , cartography and leisure and <unk w="civil"/> aviation .
It is also an important source of professional <unk w="charges"/> for the entire aviation sector .
I must also mention European industry in this sector , which has been showing continuous growth <unk w="on"/> its world market share , which currently hovers around 16 % and which it is therefore necessary to support .
The former relate <unk w="to"/> data collection <unk w="measures"/> are <unk w="based"/> on the necessity of providing political decision-makers with sufficient data and statistical information to give them a better understanding of the sector so that they can regulate it adequately .
The second point relates to the application of the principle of proportionality in <unk w="all"/> the <unk w="treaty"/> .
The key <unk w="question"/> is whether the rules designed to govern the <unk w="noise"/> of commercial aircraft will be <unk w="used"/> for <unk w="the"/> simpler and smaller , <unk w="more"/> single-engine aircraft .
We support <unk w="the"/> Commission <unk w="'s"/> its intention to apply the principle of proportionality both in drafting the rules and in their implementation , always bearing in mind the necessity of not compromising safety in general .
This is the case , for example , with the adaptation <unk w="of"/> certain airworthiness rules , already adopted by the European Aviation Safety Agency ( EASA ) , to operations with non-commercial aircraft , or the possible application of specific rules with regard to simplified security and <unk w="the"/> screening procedures in business aviation .
The third point concerns the problem <unk w="of"/> access <unk w="to"/> airports and <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
The diagnosis has been made : these aircraft generally have difficulty in accessing large airports and are starting to have the same problems <unk w="as"/> regional and secondary airports .
The solutions range from optimising the use of existing capacity to perhaps revising the regulations <unk w="on"/> slots .
It is also necessary to stimulate <unk w="interest"/> in small and medium-sized airports to provide increasing interconnections between the different European regions and cities .
As regards <unk w="the"/> question of airspace capacity , we stress the importance of reforms within the framework of the Single European Sky and the SESAR ( Single European Sky ATM Research ) Joint Undertaking and , once again , we come back to the need not to impose disproportionate demands on small aircraft in terms of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="protection"/> , while always complying with safety limits .
The fourth <unk w="and"/> <unk w="of"/> point refers to the environmental sustainability of this area <unk w="of"/> activity .
Although the CO2 emissions of small aircraft are lower , it is still necessary to promote research , development and innovation , not only within the framework of the Clean Sky and CESAR ( Cost Effective Small Aircraft ) initiatives , but also in the use of less <unk w="noise"/> engines and cleaner <unk w="alternatives"/> .
I would like to end , Mr President and Commissioner , by <unk w="expressing"/> the hope that this report represents a <unk w="new"/> framework for future legislative and regulatory measures which may be <unk w="set"/> up for the sector .
<unk w="what"/> is the <unk w="chairman"/> of the Committee <unk w="on"/> <unk w="transport"/> and Tourism when it calls on the Commission to report by the end of 2009 on the progress achieved on the issues <unk w="listed"/> in the report .
With tomorrow 's vote , my expectation is that this wish <unk w="to"/> be shared by a large majority of the Members of this House .
Member <unk w="states"/> the Commission . - Mr President , the Commission welcomes the report and thanks the rapporteur and the committee for their excellent work .
This was followed by a very positive Council conclusion in April 2008 , and now <unk w="that"/> this <unk w="particular"/> report of Parliament .
<unk w="business"/> and business aviation is <unk w="an"/> important sector <unk w="for"/> the EU <unk w="recycling"/> industry , worth about EUR 2.3 billion annually .
Over two thirds of all aircraft certified in the <unk w="uk"/> are in <unk w="this"/> sector .
The regulations need to be adapted <unk w="to"/> <unk w="a"/> specific nature , without , however , compromising safety or security .
We are <unk w="pleased"/> to see that this notion of proportionality <unk w="is"/> encouraged by Parliament in its report .
There are <unk w="two"/> main areas on which <unk w="we"/> will have to focus our efforts in the nearest future : development of common EU safety standards for general aviation ; integration of non-commercial aviation into the next generation of air traffic management ( ATM ) systems <unk w="in"/> Europe ; and reducing the negative environmental footprint of the sector .
As highlighted in your report , we have to <unk w="make"/> sure that they <unk w="are"/> not only providing for <unk w="an"/> adequate level of safety , but <unk w="it"/> also proportionate and do not impose unnecessary burden on operators .
<unk w="we"/> <unk w="will"/> also continue the development of the future ATM system for Europe <unk w="with"/> a clear understanding that <unk w="it"/> is a common good that should be accessible for all its users in a safe way .
<unk w="from"/> the perspective of general aviation , the Single European Sky and SESAR will be of the utmost importance for enhancing , in a safe way , access to airspace and aerodromes .
<unk w="new"/> technologies <unk w="must"/> open the way to new services , as yet unseen in Europe .
Last <unk w="but"/> not least , general and business <unk w="terms"/> , despite the ongoing technological advances , are also impacting <unk w="for"/> the environment and , <unk w="in"/> the wider airline industry , they <unk w="have"/> to contribute to reducing these impacts .
<unk w="this"/> <unk w="very"/> well , proportionality will be an important principle to follow .
The Commission is looking forward to working with Parliament along the lines of the report , <unk w="we"/> will report back on the progress made .
At <unk w="the"/> outset I would like to thank Lu√≠s Queir√≥ for his <unk w="work"/> on a subject so important to the future of transport in Europe .
I would like to emphasise the significance of the issue of developing general <unk w="to"/> business aviation and the aircraft manufacturing industry in this sector .
Although the solutions proposed by the Commission do not bring any radical legislative changes and may seem <unk w="too"/> little significance today , their influence on the future of aviation in the light of deregulation of the market and <unk w="that"/> of the air carriage sector <unk w=","/> <unk w="it"/> cannot be overestimated .
The Commission <unk w="'s"/> objective is to facilitate development of <unk w="the"/> aviation sector by <unk w="the"/> existing regulatory procedures , adapting provisions to new forms of air traffic management <unk w="and"/> revising them to ensure proportionality .
It is obvious that this initiative is <unk w="capable"/> of full support .
However , care should be taken that , in the processes <unk w="of"/> formulating and implementing policy , the needs <unk w="of"/> all categories <unk w="of"/> users of airspace and aviation infrastructure are given consideration in the planning and optimisation of capacity .
In order to facilitate further reform a basic <unk w=","/> data collection system should , however , be created for general and business aviation .
Ultimately it <unk w="is"/> also <unk w="be"/> necessary to facilitate the access of this sector to <unk w="the"/> markets , supporting the development of new , competitive technologies , but at the <unk w="same"/> time taking care that respect is maintained for the <unk w="health"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> environment protection .
in writing . - I <unk w="welcome"/> this report for it seeks to harmonize and bring more clarity to the rules on General and Business Aviation on a community level .
This is the fastest growing segment of civil aviation in Europe and <unk w="it"/> provides numerous social and economic benefits to Member States .
However , to <unk w="be"/> the most of it , we need to establish the proper regulation .
For <unk w="example"/> , currently there is a lack of reliable data on this sector and this deficiency must be quickly addressed for management , safety and security reasons .
The <unk w="eu"/> should make a clear distinction between large-scale commercial aircraft operations <unk w="and"/> privately owned airplanes .
The legislation should be proportional to the risks incurred by the different types of aviation <unk w="and"/> mindful in terms of <unk w="the"/> cost burden it places on them .
The future regulation should be stimulating and enhancing the <unk w="produces"/> instead of limiting it .
A cause for concern may be that most of the General <unk w="public"/> Business Aviation falls outside of the scope <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="framework"/> Directive to include aviation activities in the scheme for greenhouse gas emission <unk w="from"/> trading .
Considering the fast growth <unk w="side"/> of the sector , I think there is a need to offset its environmental impact in one form or <unk w="another"/> .
in <unk w="fact"/> . - ( <unk w="sv"/> ) At a time when we keep hearing the <unk w="word"/> ' crisis ' , it is not easy to talk about the stable future of general and business aviation .
I therefore thank Lu√≠s Queir√≥ for taking the trouble to prepare the report on this <unk w="matter"/> .
<unk w="however"/> . I am certain that <unk w="it"/> is air <unk w="travel"/> which can be a driving force , setting <unk w="the"/> world and <unk w="the"/> economy in motion .
We <unk w="know"/> that barely 106 years ago the Wright brothers made the world 's first powered , controlled flight ( although it was for <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> 40 metres ) <unk w="and"/> an aircraft .
Aviation also includes the whole complicated field of navigation and <unk w="quality"/> control , building a ground-based <unk w="of"/> infrastructure , a system of security , and so on .
We should be aware that in Europe about 50 000 aircraft are <unk w="on"/> use in general and business aviation , and almost four times as <unk w="for"/> small aircraft and gliders are <unk w="responsible"/> for <unk w="long"/> and recreation .
<unk w="in"/> this context , ensuring <unk w="the"/> capacity for <unk w="the"/> European airspace and for airports themselves is <unk w="an"/> extremely important issue .
I would like here to draw attention to the significance of regional airports for ensuring cohesion of communication in <unk w="the"/> EU .
Mr President , the debate on the aviation industry is frequently distorted : there <unk w="is"/> a biased focus on the problems of emissions from air traffic but <unk w="they"/> are not prepared <unk w="to"/> see its potential .
Obviously , aviation and air traffic cause emissions , but it is <unk w="just"/> as obvious that they represent the future .
Although EU internal market legislation has mainly addressed commercial <unk w="policy"/> <unk w="management"/> , it is <unk w="worth"/> noting that issues to do <unk w="with"/> general and business aviation are tending to crop up more and more in areas such as climate policy , protection of the environment and aviation safety .
When we take into <unk w="account"/> <unk w="the"/> growing importance of business aviation in particular , we definitely need to pay attention <unk w="to"/> these sectors and guarantee their competitiveness .
I wish to express a concern I have with <unk w="regard"/> to business conditions for aviation .
Small <unk w="and"/> medium-sized airports are crucial for both general <unk w="and"/> business aviation . Their establishment and <unk w="training"/> should be promoted and Member <unk w="states"/> encouraged to invest .
The <unk w="economic"/> growth in business aviation , however , is clogging up the airports in use more and more .
From the perspective of climate <unk w="change"/> , we can say that , although smaller aircraft <unk w="are"/> not included in the future Emission Trading System , a voluntary carbon-offset mechanism is <unk w="being"/> developed by the sector .
<unk w="this"/> is a sign of the development potential of air traffic <unk w="as"/> a whole .
The <unk w="commission"/> should do all it can to encourage research into more innovative and more <unk w="efficient"/> and environmentally friendly aircraft .
- <unk w="the"/> next item is a short presentation of the report by Mrs <unk w="lucas"/> , on <unk w="behalf"/> of <unk w="the"/> Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality , <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> non-discrimination based on gender and inter-generational solidarity .
May I first of all <unk w=","/> thank all <unk w="the"/> Members for their help with my own-initiative report .
<unk w="by"/> voting in the <unk w="committee"/> on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality was the result of much wide-ranging discussion and accommodation .
The men and women who are today involved in establishing inter-generational solidarity networks <unk w="and"/> recognition .
Their determination is an important contribution to national and European wealth and <unk w="in"/> the common good .
Unfortunately , <unk w="this"/> contribution is not included in national statistics <unk w="and"/> accounts .
This is the <unk w="reason"/> why men and women are being exposed to hidden <unk w="types"/> of discrimination .
Women and men are <unk w="subjected"/> to a free choice of suitable and comfortable activities .
The obligation on society is to guarantee this freedom of <unk w="movement"/> and not to discriminate against any activity simply <unk w="because"/> it does not fall within the usual scope <unk w="of"/> the formal labour market .
This is a brief summary of my own-initiative report on non-discrimination based on gender <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> solidarity .
The subject of this report <unk w="is"/> at the heart of discussions on the <unk w="issue"/> of <unk w="terrorism"/> and <unk w="parliament"/> in its Member States .
Although it is a rather technical <unk w="one"/> , it also has a human dimension .
There is something in it for all of us as each of us lives within <unk w="matters"/> of broader or narrower family and social relationships , in which we are personally involved .
Restricting <unk w="this"/> concept <unk w="of"/> inter-generational <unk w="addition"/> to just childcare is a mistaken interpretation .
Inter-generational solidarity also involves responsibility <unk w="for"/> <unk w="regard"/> to our parents and elders and care for dependents .
Human resources managers agree that human capabilities are comparable <unk w="to"/> university degrees .
<unk w="it"/> is therefore necessary <unk w="to"/> assess this value in <unk w="an"/> explicit and <unk w="transparent"/> manner .
The European Union must create a political framework in order to achieve <unk w="this"/> <unk w="success"/> .
Women are the <unk w="right"/> to contribute to inter-generational solidarity , thus participating in the creation of social relations .
This is why <unk w="this"/> report is devoted mainly to them .
<unk w="the"/> research by <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> and demographers suggests that women 's contribution <unk w="to"/> gross domestic product <unk w="would"/> be even <unk w="higher"/> if their unpaid work were factored in .
Ignoring this fact means maintaining the ideas of <unk w="the"/> past .
We must look <unk w="carefully"/> <unk w="in"/> order to <unk w="improve"/> the <unk w="conditions"/> for all women and men to become involved in inter-generational solidarity regardless of their social standing .
The European Union must act if <unk w="it"/> is serious about non-discrimination and equality of <unk w="rights"/> .
My political group , the Group of the European People <unk w="'s"/> Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , is proud of its support for a policy of non-discrimination which pursues the general good <unk w="and"/> respects the distinct characteristics and complementary nature of men and <unk w="women"/> .
Ladies and gentlemen , I should also like to point <unk w="out"/> that this report is <unk w="the"/> result of extensive consultations with numerous women 's non-governmental organisations .
In my report , I have also taken account of the opinions of three of our Parliament 's Intergroups : ATD <unk w="and"/> Monde , the Intergroup on Family and Protection of Childhood and the Intergroup on Carers .
The Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality <unk w="and"/> adopted <unk w="the"/> report unanimously .
Ladies and gentlemen , I should like to invite you to <unk w="ask"/> <unk w="you"/> to continue with this cooperation and to vote tomorrow for the FEMM <unk w="parliament"/> 's motion for a <unk w="resolution"/> .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I <unk w="congratulate"/> Ms Z√°borsk√° <unk w="'s"/> work is very important <unk w="on"/> the subject she is tackling is one <unk w="which"/> is of the utmost importance <unk w="for"/> our society .
The question of dependence will become more <unk w="and"/> more important in the future because of demographic ageing , but <unk w="the"/> <unk w="lack"/> of equality between men <unk w="and"/> women <unk w="and"/> the care of children and dependants is still carried out mostly by women .
<unk w="however"/> , we have to put into practice measures that <unk w="are"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="to"/> stay in the labour market by <unk w="the"/> family <unk w="and"/> conditions , especially those that facilitate a balance between professional <unk w="and"/> private life .
As specifically concerns the situation regarding <unk w="the"/> care of dependants , the Commission has already <unk w="proposed"/> the following actions on the table .
<unk w="the"/> Commission is also studying the quality of services for elderly dependent <unk w="women"/> and protection against ill treatment , as well as measures <unk w="which"/> could <unk w="be"/> taken at European level in <unk w="cooperation"/> with the Member States to speed up the development <unk w="and"/> modernisation of infrastructure and services .
The EU cohesion <unk w="fund"/> , through the European Social Fund , will continue to cofinance initiatives at national and local level .
The open method of coordination in the field of social protection and social inclusion pays particular attention to the modernisation of pension schemes to take greater account of new <unk w="forms"/> of work , career breaks and long-term care for dependent people .
We would like to congratulate <unk w="you"/> on the very important <unk w="work"/> done .
( EL ) Mr President , I should like to comment that , in this report which was adopted with an absolute majority <unk w="in"/> the Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality , there is also an alternative motion tabled by certain Members .
We shall be called on tomorrow to vote by choosing between this motion and <unk w="the"/> motion tabled <unk w="by"/> a parliamentary committee .
<unk w="we"/> cannot talk about this alternative motion in plenary , nor can we <unk w="also"/> <unk w="the"/> Members who tabled it and nor can we express an <unk w="opinion"/> on it .
It is a defect in the new rules <unk w="which"/> you need to bear in mind .
- Yes , Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou , what I said <unk w="earlier"/> to Mrs Doyle also applies here .
We are <unk w="under"/> Rule 45 which , in fact , provides a very strict framework for our speaking time , since only the rapporteur can take the floor .
We take our lead from <unk w="the"/> Conference of Presidents , which decided that this subject came under that particular Rule .
<unk w="the"/> Rules of Procedure certainly ought to be developed to allow <unk w="for"/> greater flexibility and richer debates , but , as you will understand , it <unk w="is"/> not <unk w="acceptable"/> to me to amend <unk w="the"/> Rules of Procedure this evening .
<unk w="but"/> based on gender <unk w="mainstreaming"/> still a reality , <unk w="however"/> , even in the European <unk w="union"/> Member States .
This fact is not only <unk w="possible"/> in the private sector , where men account for nine-tenths of the members of boards of directors in large companies , but also in the public sector where <unk w="they"/> are also <unk w="involved"/> .
However , the <unk w="lisbon"/> Strategy aims to ensure that 60 % of women able to <unk w="work"/> are in employment .
<unk w="apart"/> from this , we must not forget <unk w="that"/> one of the biggest challenges in Europe in the medium- and long-term is the demographic situation .
The European Union <unk w="is"/> facing a bigger rise in the average age of its population than other regions of the world , along with a population growth of just 0.4 % , which means that the European Union <unk w="will"/> need , <unk w="at"/> the same time , to face up to a fall in the population able to <unk w="reach"/> and an ageing population .
<unk w="secondly"/> , the choice between having a career and raising a family <unk w="could"/> not be definitive or mandatory and it must be possible to balance these two aspects of life .
One of the European <unk w="union"/> 's key values is to eliminate any form of discrimination .
Apart from eliminating discrimination , which also means between men and women , <unk w="which"/> have the responsibility to implement proactive measures to encourage professional careers for women .
In addition , they are not only underrepresented in numerical terms , but <unk w="even"/> within the management hierarchy : the higher the level in the <unk w="eu"/> , the lower the proportion of women .
In this way , society is depriving itself of the <unk w="full"/> potential of an important section of the population .
The highly competitive nature of <unk w="terrorism"/> , the inherent geographical <unk w="problems"/> associated with scientific work , along <unk w="by"/> establishing a career <unk w="for"/> a relatively late age all make this activity difficult to combine with family life .
I am taking advantage of the discussion of this <unk w="issue"/> to <unk w="increase"/> the need to introduce specific policies aimed at achieving equality between <unk w="men"/> and women in the academic profession .
These policies must take into account a set of good practices at <unk w="european"/> level , such as facilitating dual careers , encouraging universities and research institutes to invest in childcare centres , as well as fast-track access to academic posts for women .
The <unk w="member"/> States of the European Union must <unk w="promote"/> demographic renewal , <unk w="and"/> <unk w="the"/> action <unk w="and"/> the renewed Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs , in line with the policy <unk w="of"/> equality between men and women .
A balance in European societies depends on the sum total <unk w="of"/> solidarity <unk w="and"/> between the generations , which are more complex than ever <unk w="before"/> : young people continue <unk w="to"/> live <unk w="in"/> their parents ' home <unk w=","/> longer periods , while it is increasingly common for those parents <unk w="who"/> have to look after their aging relatives as well .
The burden that this represents rests primarily on the <unk w="internet"/> and middle-aged generation , and especially on women .
For this reason , equality between women and <unk w="women"/> , that is <unk w="to"/> say , equal opportunities in the broader sense , would seem to be a fundamental condition for bringing about new forms of inter-generational solidarity .
With regard <unk w="to"/> family obligations , that is , the reconciliation of family <unk w="reunification"/> and work , the question of equality between men and women is clearly very important if European families are <unk w="to"/> gain new impetus .
<unk w="it"/> is also of critical importance to guarantee <unk w="the"/> opportunity for childcare of appropriate quality and quantity for <unk w="people"/> who would like <unk w="to"/> take up paid employment alongside childrearing .
<unk w="the"/> Socialist Group in the European Parliament is <unk w="doing"/> everything it can to ensure that the goals of Barcelona Process are met , and notes with disappointment that this objective is visibly absent from <unk w="the"/> Czech Presidency 's programme .
<unk w="if"/> Europe wishes <unk w="to"/> <unk w="reverse"/> the trend <unk w="towards"/> <unk w="a"/> reduction , we must , through the <unk w="end"/> of the <unk w="commission"/> and the Member States , support families <unk w="in"/> all possible ways , <unk w="to"/> permit women and men to combine family life and work , but such that obligations connected with home and family are equally divided between men and women .
I wholeheartedly support the alternative <unk w="proposal"/> for a European Parliament <unk w="decision"/> on non-discrimination based on gender and inter-generational <unk w="rights"/> , <unk w="which"/> is <unk w="more"/> realistic than the preceding report .
I must particularly emphasise the objective of creating a care policy that <unk w="is"/> balanced between the genders .
<unk w="we"/> in the performance of caring is often <unk w="accompanied"/> by the absence of <unk w="information"/> , available and high-quality services in Member States , and women are <unk w="concerned"/> with the inevitability of sacrificing their opportunities to participate in <unk w="democracy"/> , <unk w="political"/> and political life .
All of this preserves the inequality in the <unk w="domain"/> of obligations <unk w=","/> with home and family between men and women , which generally forces women to <unk w="have"/> a more flexible organisation of labour or give up working , <unk w="which"/> in turn <unk w="out"/> their career , the <unk w="political"/> disparity between the wages earned by <unk w="women"/> and men , and pension rights .
I am cautious of the recommendation of the Czech Presidency to make childcare ' a fully valid <unk w="approach"/> to a professional career ' .
I <unk w="am"/> convinced that the implementation of this recommendation would perpetuate the traditional division of labour between <unk w="men"/> and women .
The measures planned in the framework of the Lisbon Strategy play an important role in establishing equality in the <unk w="division"/> of labour between <unk w="women"/> and men ; their objective , in addition to increasing employment , promoting innovation and raising productivity , must also be to eliminate in the EU the gender discrimination that has developed over time .
Ideal mothers who spent their <unk w="young"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> their children represent today the majority of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> female population and it is this childcare and homecare that is not reflected in <unk w="their"/> pensions .
Many of them do not receive an appropriate pension for this socially valuable work <unk w="in"/> their active life and this exposes <unk w="led"/> to a greater risk <unk w="of"/> poverty .
<unk w="there"/> is also a reason why young women are postponing motherhood and giving priority to a professional <unk w="debate"/> .
During my many speeches in the House , I have constantly emphasised that mothers and fathers who freely choose <unk w="to"/> bring <unk w="about"/> their children or to care for <unk w="children"/> or dependent family members must not <unk w="suffer"/> discrimination .
I know <unk w="the"/> <unk w="those"/> who have disabled relatives and carry out this demanding work with great courage despite the obstacles they <unk w="only"/> have to overcome .
In this speech , I should like to praise the proposals made <unk w="by"/> the rapporteur Mrs Anna <unk w="mollar"/> , which recommend recognition not only of traditional forms of gainful employment but also of <unk w="the"/> manifold <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> non-gainful employment <unk w="carried"/> out in families as part of inter-generational solidarity .
However , <unk w="this"/> is not the case <unk w="in"/> one <unk w="of"/> the parents carries out this work .
I believe that the report will <unk w="encourage"/> Member States to adopt measures to improve family policy within the EU .
At a time when Europe is facing a deep economic crisis whose final magnitude may be difficult to <unk w="implement"/> , it is only to be expected that the birth rate will feel the negative <unk w="effects"/> of the turmoil on the labour <unk w="market"/> , as many women will tend not to have children because they are terrified of the possibility of losing their job and <unk w="a"/> <unk w="a"/> reduction in the <unk w="human"/> resources required to care <unk w="for"/> and bring up their <unk w="lives"/> .
Against this background , it is the duty of every Member State to promote <unk w="humanitarian"/> activities , such as ' bridge-between-generation ' centres , where older adults are paid to <unk w="the"/> care of and bring up children .
These ' bridge-between-generation ' centres , <unk w="to"/> operate successfully in some Member States , would allow women who have had a child to return <unk w="their"/> work quite soon , while also making it easier for <unk w="the"/> retired people to return to employment .
Successfully balancing professional and personal life is starting to become a strenuous <unk w="priority"/> for women .
It is therefore now even more <unk w="difficult"/> for Member States to promote the birth rate and <unk w="to"/> pay proper attention to families .
In this area the EU could indirectly contribute and help Member States to modernise <unk w="its"/> policies .
I consider that recognition of ' unseen labour ' is one of the important steps <unk w="that"/> could be taken in this field .
We also <unk w="cannot"/> ignore the fact that ever more people of active age are looking after children and <unk w="the"/> elderly relatives at the same time , leaving them in a precarious position .
<unk w="that"/> is why it is particularly important <unk w="for"/> <unk w="the"/> Commission to introduce practical initiatives for the official recognition of <unk w="experience"/> gained from activities connected with looking after children and dependent people , and household management , so that these skills are taken into account when rejoining the labour market .
Today we need to think <unk w="about"/> the <unk w="impact"/> <unk w="of"/> all these mothers who <unk w=","/> after children , who <unk w="dream"/> the future of Europe , and protect them from the risk of <unk w="the"/> day receiving small pensions and being <unk w="in"/> an unequal position compared with other members of society .
Pre-commercial Procurement : Driving innovation <unk w="to"/> ensure sustainable high quality public services in Europe ( short presentation )
- The next item is a short presentation of the report by Mr Harbour , <unk w="on"/> behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market <unk w="and"/> Consumer Protection , on pre-commercial procurement : driving innovation <unk w="and"/> ensure sustainable high quality public services <unk w="in"/> Europe .
rapporteur . - Mr President , it is particularly appropriate that Mrs Reding is <unk w="not"/> for the <unk w="debate"/> tonight because my report is focused on a proposal that has been <unk w="taken"/> over a number of years <unk w="for"/> her services .
My first message to the Commissioner tonight is to thank her services for <unk w="your"/> leadership on this , but to say that I think this <unk w="debate"/> needs to be much better known .
It needs to spread out widely from <unk w="the"/> Information Society - <unk w="and"/> I think it is now starting to do - because <unk w="it"/> is <unk w="of"/> such importance , particularly in the economic times <unk w=","/> are in at the moment .
Well , the core <unk w="of"/> the issue is that public authorities in the European Union spend huge <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of public money on buying products and services .
It is estimated that <unk w="approximately"/> 1 800 billion is spent on public <unk w="funds"/> every year .
How much of that procurement is actually spent on investigating , researching and encouraging <unk w="the"/> development of new solutions to the big challenges that public authorities and indeed society face every day : a better health service , a better transport solution , dealing with climate change , more energy efficient buildings ?
EU procurement <unk w="is"/> linked to <unk w="research"/> and development is less than 1 % of that total procurement <unk w="tariffs"/> .
Bearing in mind that we <unk w="need"/> an explicit objective in the Lisbon Strategy to <unk w="improve"/> our R & D spending up towards <unk w="the"/> 3 % target , there is <unk w="a"/> potential here .
That is where the <unk w="un"/> mission of pre-commercial procurement comes in .
We want those intelligent customers to really think ahead , to be demanding , to think <unk w="about"/> the solutions for which no <unk w="longer"/> <unk w="as"/> yet exists , <unk w="and"/> where <unk w="there"/> are basically a range of solutions which can then <unk w="be"/> developed with the financial contribution from the public authority to do just that - to fund research <unk w="and"/> development , perhaps <unk w="in"/> a first competing stage of ideas , and then take <unk w="the"/> <unk w="appropriate"/> solutions <unk w="to"/> a next stage towards the viability of a product or service that <unk w="can"/> then be launched .
The benefits of having <unk w="been"/> <unk w="it"/> , for a <unk w="new"/> enterprise in particular , and giving that commercial support will be really important to that business .
Indeed , where this has been already rolled out , we see the experience where businesses , even if they do <unk w="not"/> produce <unk w="a"/> winning solution , have had <unk w="an"/> element of their research <unk w="and"/> development funded that they can then go on and use to develop other revenue-generating products .
This also ties in with the second initiative from the Commission covered <unk w="in"/> my report , the ' lead market initiative ' , where we are looking for public authorities to lead in a number of key technology areas around health and climate change in transport .
<unk w="there"/> are signs of <unk w="an"/> integrated policy emerging , but my report says that we need <unk w="more"/> training , we need more best practice , and <unk w="we"/> need more <unk w="information"/> and dissemination of <unk w="this"/> proposal .
I hope that <unk w="the"/> Commissioner , and indeed the College , will <unk w="be"/> <unk w="us"/> on this and that this Parliament will show it is right behind this solution .
In conclusion - <unk w="and"/> if you will allow <unk w="such"/> a short amount of extra time because this is , in a sense a point <unk w="of"/> order - I <unk w="want"/> to point out first of all to this empty House that I had two opinions for my report from Mr Sakalas from the Committee on Legal Affairs and Mrs Podimata from the Committee on Industry .
They are of course not allowed to present those opinions here , which seems rather a <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> since they made valuable contributions which I have added to my amendments .
I also want to thank <unk w="you"/> shadow , Mr Hasse Ferreira , for <unk w="dealing"/> with me , <unk w="and"/> he has also contributed extensively .
That is why it is so important and why , when we are looking to <unk w="the"/> <unk w="need"/> to continue <unk w=","/> in this time of economic crisis , this proposal is even more important than it was when I started this report a few month <unk w="ago"/> .
Member of the Commission . - Mr <unk w="president"/> , I could not agree more , because <unk w="public"/> procurement serves a <unk w="strategic"/> goal .
It improves the <unk w="provision"/> of <unk w="public"/> services , but most of <unk w="that"/> it opens up <unk w=","/> for <unk w="us"/> to take the lead in international markets .
So <unk w="it"/> is <unk w="all"/> very well spent , <unk w="but"/> all in a time of crisis when <unk w="we"/> need <unk w="to"/> help our industry to put into practice the results of research and to make the best use of technological solutions <unk w="and"/> innovations .
I <unk w="am"/> very glad that the rapporteur , Mr Harbour , together <unk w="with"/> the Commission , has supported <unk w="what"/> has been in the pipeline for quite a long time .
Indeed , triggering a strong public-sector demand <unk w="for"/> <unk w="the"/> development of new innovative products and services in Europe can make a difference , especially for our SMEs , and that is why I welcome the initiative .
What are <unk w="the"/> next concrete steps <unk w="we"/> will have to take ?
As an immediate response to the concrete recommendations in the report , I can confirm that the Commission <unk w="should"/> support actions to promote <unk w="the"/> sharing of experience <unk w="and"/> awareness-raising , <unk w="which"/> will explore the <unk w="need"/> to provide incentives for procurers across a number <unk w="of"/> Member <unk w="states"/> in order to <unk w="support"/> pre-commercial procurement projects jointly .
The Commission has already opened calls for proposals - in the INTERREG , CIP and <unk w="related"/> programmes - to support the establishment of networks of public authorities on pre-commercial procurement .
In the medium to long term , I <unk w="hope"/> that governments <unk w="in"/> Europe should incorporate <unk w="public"/> procurement in their strategic planning for public <unk w="interest"/> .
On the Commission <unk w="proposal"/> , I will emphasise this in a communication planned for early March this year , in which I will propose a strengthened strategy for ICT Research , Development and Innovation for Europe , <unk w="and"/> pre-commercial procurement will be included in this report .
In the coming months we hope <unk w="we"/> see more of those , and I invite the members of <unk w="the"/> committee , and also the Members of this House , to go back to their <unk w="right"/> and to talk to <unk w="the"/> ministers and the municipalities about pre-commercial procurement .
We can only make a <unk w="contribution"/> if we work together .
Thank you very much for giving a <unk w="answer"/> <unk w="answer"/> here .
Driving innovation and developing the <unk w="irish"/> economy are key in ensuring sustainable <unk w=","/> quality public services .
The US public sector <unk w="spends"/> USD 50 billion per year on research and development procurement , which <unk w="is"/> twenty times higher than in the EU , and therefore Member States must honour their commitment <unk w="to"/> invest 3 % of GDP in research <unk w="and"/> development .
Public procurement is a <unk w="new"/> instrument to achieve this goal .
The current practice in the EU is based on <unk w="sustainable"/> development , which <unk w="means"/> that each company retains the ownership rights in respect of the new ideas it generates .
Despite the fact that pre-commercial procurement <unk w="covers"/> some simplification , <unk w="the"/> whole process is very exacting .
Public <unk w="opinion"/> may be considerably <unk w="affected"/> by the participation of universities and research institutes .
Member States should <unk w="be"/> <unk w="borne"/> by the experiences <unk w="of"/> the European innovation agencies taking part in research and development .
I believe that , on <unk w="the"/> basis <unk w=","/> the suggestions in Malcolm Harbour 's report , <unk w="the"/> Commission will produce a comprehensive , easy-to-understand handbook to <unk w="portugal"/> in particular small and medium-sized enterprises and appropriate authorities <unk w="in"/> the field of public procurement with assistance <unk w="and"/> implementation .
It is only through close cooperation between EU Member States <unk w="in"/> the field of public procurement that we <unk w="shall"/> <unk w="be"/> able <unk w="to"/> drive innovation and ensure sustainable high quality public services .
Debates on cases of breaches of human <unk w="rights"/> , democracy and the rule of law ( announcement of motions for resolutions tabled ) : <unk w="""/> Minutes
Combating the sexual exploitation of <unk w="children"/> and child pornography ( debate )
The <unk w="next"/> item <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> report by Mrs Angelilli , on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , on a proposal <unk w="for"/> a European Parliament recommendation to the Council <unk w="on"/> combating <unk w="the"/> sexual exploitation <unk w="of"/> children and child pornography .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to begin <unk w="by"/> thanking my fellow Members <unk w="for"/> their excellent collaboration , which has enabled us , <unk w="in"/> my opinion , to draft a highly satisfactory text .
I am also grateful to <unk w="both"/> the NGOs and <unk w="those"/> that have followed our work closely .
We set out <unk w="the"/> two key objectives , the first being to check carefully <unk w="on"/> what extent the <unk w="new"/> framework decision is being implemented within <unk w="the"/> 27 Member States , and the second being to propose <unk w=","/> as necessary .
The fact is that the framework decision must be updated to increase the level of protection for minors , <unk w="in"/> light of the rise in new and disturbing cases of exploitation linked to new technologies .
The first of the <unk w="commission"/> identified is the <unk w="fight"/> against sex tourism , which worryingly is on the rise , partly because of lower travel costs .
<unk w="from"/> this point of <unk w="view"/> , extra-territorial cooperation should be improved and Member States should <unk w="be"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="to"/> rule out the principle of double criminality for crimes concerning the exploitation and abuse of children .
Secondly , <unk w="however"/> , that is to say online psychological manipulation with the aim of soliciting children for sexual purposes , should <unk w="be"/> considered a criminal offence in all Member States .
Among the proposals to <unk w="be"/> implemented <unk w="as"/> soon as possible is the launch of the missing <unk w="and"/> rapid alert system .
This system has already been <unk w="defined"/> and implemented , although by only a <unk w="large"/> number <unk w="of"/> Member States and so only at trial level , but has given excellent <unk w="support"/> .
We therefore need to roll it out across all 27 <unk w="member"/> States .
It is worth remembering , in fact , that <unk w="every"/> year in Europe , thousands and thousands of children disappear <unk w="to"/> trace .
I would like to highlight one further aspect : in general , national legislative authorities must commit to improving protection for child victims during investigations and before and after any court case in which <unk w="they"/> are involved .
This will prevent children from becoming victims <unk w="of"/> over , firstly victims of <unk w="war"/> , and then victims of media or legal violation .
Finally , we have <unk w="anticipated"/> the need for urgency in criminalising forced marriages , the majority of which concern children .
To conclude , Mr President , I <unk w="think"/> it is important to ask all Member States to ratify <unk w="as"/> soon <unk w="as"/> possible the most recent Council <unk w="of"/> Europe Convention on the <unk w="protection"/> of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse .
This is the convention of October 2007 , <unk w="a"/> benchmark representing the most innovative and up-to-date act on child protection .
<unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of the Commission . - ( FR ) Mr President , ladies <unk w="and"/> gentlemen , I would first <unk w="like"/> to thank Mrs Angelilli warmly for her <unk w="excellent"/> report .
I would also <unk w="like"/> to thank her for the way she <unk w="has"/> worked with <unk w="the"/> Commission on a very delicate , sensitive subject about which we feel so <unk w="far"/> .
Sexual abuse <unk w="permits"/> the various types of exploitation , especially child pornography , are despicable crimes with <unk w="terrorism"/> , long-lasting effects on its young victims .
Some sources say that between 10 and 20 % of children in <unk w="colombia"/> have suffered one form of sexual attack or another during their childhood .
The European Union <unk w="has"/> armed itself with legislation on the issue .
The framework decision <unk w="no"/> 2004 establishes a minimum level of <unk w="protection"/> for national legislations in respect of <unk w="law"/> and jurisdiction .
The development of the Internet is <unk w="due"/> to the proliferation <unk w="of"/> <unk w="death"/> threats for our children .
<unk w="child"/> pornography is one of these and others exist , such as child solicitation , <unk w="in"/> which Mrs Angelilli has alluded .
Sex tourism to third countries for the purposes of abusing children is a reality , whilst it is not unknown for <unk w="us"/> to be committed by individuals who <unk w="have"/> been convicted in other Member States .
At the end of 2007 , they negotiated a convention with <unk w="the"/> Council of Europe to introduce a very high standard of protection .
In its first year , 20 <unk w="of"/> the 27 Member States have <unk w="ratified"/> this convention .
That said , <unk w="there"/> is still <unk w="completely"/> satisfied , and Mrs Angelilli 's report is evidence of this .
Parliament demands better implementation and especially a substantial <unk w="increase"/> in the European <unk w="union"/> , with a set of <unk w="measures"/> to reinforce the fight <unk w="against"/> these crimes .
I have announced a review of the <unk w="current"/> European <unk w="union"/> on the issue <unk w="and"/> will submit a proposal for adoption by the Commissioners in March .
I want to <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> an <unk w="excellent"/> text on the <unk w="matter"/> that will deal not only with enforcement but also protection for victims and prevention .
The suggestions contained <unk w="in"/> the report will help us to implement this proposal .
Most of the report 's contents should find a place in the new framework decision , but <unk w="if"/> this proves not <unk w="to"/> be possible , for technical or legal reasons , we will try to identify the most suitable <unk w="means"/> to implement any proposals left out of this framework decision .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am pleased to note Parliament 's desire to move forward with the <unk w="definition"/> of ' kidnap warning ' mechanisms in <unk w="the"/> Member State .
I have to say , at <unk w="the"/> last meeting of the interior <unk w="of"/> justice <unk w="""/> , I argued with much determination that it was necessary <unk w="to"/> provide each of <unk w="the"/> Member States with a ' kidnap warning ' <unk w="system"/> .
To be fully effective , these systems would , <unk w="of"/> course , have to be interconnected .
Once again , I would like to thank the <unk w="european"/> Parliament for its determined commitment .
I also thank Mrs Angelilli , who <unk w="has"/> unquestionably given us a high quality report .
<unk w="draftsman"/> of the opinion of the Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality . - ( <unk w="es"/> ) Mr President , <unk w="ladies"/> and gentlemen , the <unk w="commission"/> proposal submitted by the <unk w="commission"/> is urgently needed .
The members of the <unk w="committee"/> on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality <unk w=","/> specific questions and suggestions relating to <unk w="the"/> proposal .
It is essential that <unk w="we"/> <unk w=","/> beyond <unk w="the"/> confines of the Daphne Programme and introduce legislative <unk w="measures"/> in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="of"/> child pornography .
For example , I believe that Europol <unk w="is"/> an important <unk w="policy"/> which , combined with an effective network of experts <unk w=","/> a special unit <unk w="that"/> members have had training on very specific issues , can be used to combat child pornography <unk w="and"/> prostitution .
We must also resolve the question of extraterritoriality by <unk w="adopting"/> a joint European approach .
We need more background information in the form of concrete studies on the social situation of the victims , because family members themselves are often responsible for <unk w="their"/> children <unk w="and"/> putting them on the net .
I hope that the Commission is prepared to work closely with the Committee on Women 's <unk w="rights"/> and Gender Equality <unk w="means"/> that we <unk w="must"/> resolve these questions together .
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Mr <unk w="president"/> , Europol 's organised crime report of 2006 stated that the advantages the Internet <unk w="implies"/> in terms of information and communication technology are extremely beneficial to organised crime .
According to experts , around 90 % of <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> to 17 year-olds chat on the Internet .
Besides classmates and games , they use ' unknown user ' networks via chat rooms on websites , which are perfect contact points for paedophiles using false identities to lure <unk w="the"/> victims .
According to Internet Watch Foundation , which processed more <unk w="than"/> 30 000 <unk w="tonnes"/> in 2006 , 91 % of victims were under 12 years old .
Eighty per cent were <unk w="concerned"/> , and child <unk w="pornography"/> domains totalled <unk w="more"/> than 3 000 .
Moreover , 55 % of all child abuse domains were hosted in the United States , <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> % in Russia and only 8 % in Europe .
It would be appropriate to put cooperation in the field of disabling websites abusing children on the agenda of <unk w="the"/> EU-US meeting .
We are witnessing a <unk w="new"/> international <unk w="conference"/> of <unk w="war"/> and organised crimes connected with the sex industry , as stated by Mrs Angelilli .
<unk w="it"/> is almost incredible that eight ratifications are still missing in the case of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children , child prostitution and child pornography ; four in the case of the <unk w="new"/> Protocol , which is the basic document for international <unk w="cooperation"/> in combating <unk w="trafficking"/> in human beings .
Slightly less than <unk w="one"/> of the Member States have still not <unk w="informed"/> the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime .
Therefore , it is time to send a strong and clear message to the Council to revise the <unk w="new"/> framework decision combating the sexual exploitation of children and <unk w="child"/> pornography .
Mr President , <unk w="the"/> Barrot , <unk w="ladies"/> and <unk w="gentlemen"/> , I would <unk w="like"/> <unk w="to"/> start by thanking <unk w="commissioner"/> Angelilli and everyone else for their very constructive cooperation .
You will surely remember how little was done at the beginning of this parliamentary term , but with the children 's strategy a <unk w="year"/> ago , the issue of children 's <unk w="rights"/> <unk w="in"/> a corner .
The <unk w="way"/> we are to <unk w="have"/> here <unk w="today"/> concerns a <unk w="country"/> 's right not to be sexually abused <unk w="by"/> the combating of child <unk w="abuse"/> .
I am , of course , particularly happy with the three <unk w="amendments"/> that I managed to get accepted in the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs and which I hope will be retained through the <unk w="commission"/> today .
The first proposal is that a <unk w="solution"/> should be classed <unk w="as"/> such until he or she is 18 years old .
It is very important to be able to protect both young girls and young boys against sexual crimes , sexual <unk w="abuse"/> and sexual exploitation <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="child"/> .
The second proposal is <unk w="to"/> protect children against child sex tourism by all Member States criminalising sexual crimes both within and outside the EU .
This means that those who commit crimes <unk w="are"/> never <unk w="be"/> able to be sex tourists <unk w="who"/> exploit the poorest and youngest children and young people in other countries because <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and punishment will await them <unk w="when"/> they arrive home , wherever that is in the EU .
The third proposal is that we should now seriously tackle the Internet and , <unk w="even"/> with the largest credit companies , develop <unk w="the"/> technical means , with the help of banks <unk w="to"/> exchange bureaux , Internet service providers and search engine providers <unk w="and"/> , of course , the travel industry , to close down payment systems when payment is made for sex crimes and <unk w="terrorism"/> or the sexual exploitation of children and young people .
<unk w="the"/> same opinions are found everywhere where people <unk w="are"/> striving to get websites closed down and that <unk w="will"/> that children come before confidentiality and that the abuse of <unk w="sportsmen"/> and young people must be reported .
With this report we can now sit back and <unk w="am"/> satisfied that , here <unk w="in"/> Parliament , we have taken the first step in respect <unk w="of"/> the rights of children , and when <unk w="we"/> get a new <unk w="round"/> of Lisbon , children <unk w="'s"/> rights will also be a legal basis and a goal within the EU , and this is not before time .
Mr <unk w="president"/> , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> legal systems of Member States make provision for sanctions against the sexual exploitation of children <unk w="and"/> child pornography , it is still necessary to <unk w="increase"/> the level of protection of our children .
It should <unk w="be"/> emphasised that children <unk w="can"/> use new technologies , and especially the Internet , are at risk of contact with <unk w="the"/> perpetrators of sexual <unk w="abuse"/> .
In connection <unk w="with"/> the danger which exists , Member States should be <unk w="called"/> upon to block access to Internet sites which contain child pornography .
There is also an urgent need to carry out a Europe-wide campaign to make <unk w=","/> and teenagers aware of <unk w="the"/> dangers of child <unk w="pornography"/> on the Internet .
It is <unk w="an"/> obligation to give the best possible protection to our children .
on behalf <unk w="of"/> the Verts / ALE Group . - Mr President , I should like to <unk w="thank"/> <unk w="mrs"/> Angelilli for this report .
I would echo what has been said by <unk w="my"/> colleague , Ms Bauer , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="one"/> of our own Member States taking <unk w="decisions"/> to sign <unk w="and"/> ratify some of the conventions and <unk w="principles"/> which are missing at the moment .
If we are <unk w="calling"/> for a common <unk w="approach"/> and a common approach , these are very key reference points which also help to send a signal from Member States that they , too , are concerned about these issues .
I think this is one of <unk w="the"/> key things <unk w="we"/> should be doing , and it would be interesting to know why certain Member States have not yet <unk w="been"/> <unk w="kept"/> up to the relevant conventions and protocols .
We welcome much of <unk w="this"/> report in terms of the <unk w="european"/> approach , which I would like to see <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> on and away from the view that it is only about criminal justice .
This is actually <unk w="both"/> the <unk w="convention"/> and the protection of children and young <unk w="people"/> .
We need those clear measures to support children who have been victims - whether through court <unk w="or"/> , where obviously the key issue is to find the <unk w="alternative"/> <unk w=","/> not in a way that <unk w="make"/> children more traumatised <unk w="than"/> they were at the beginning of <unk w="the"/> process , or through <unk w="a"/> collective work on identifying <unk w="them"/> .
However , the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="also"/> has to involve the children themselves .
<unk w="we"/> should encourage Internet <unk w="access"/> among children as well their <unk w="full"/> understanding of what the dangers are and what they should be looking for so that they , too , can play an active part in helping to combat these crimes .
<unk w="we"/> intend to <unk w="clarify"/> certain <unk w="of"/> the amendments this morning , <unk w="and"/> where we think <unk w="there"/> are certain principles which <unk w="are"/> tamper with at <unk w="the"/> peril - such as on double criminality and confidentiality in certain <unk w="sectors"/> - and one or two others where <unk w="we"/> think the concept perhaps needs further definition .
We are , <unk w="therefore"/> , generally very much in favour of this report and look forward to <unk w="any"/> further progress .
on behalf of <unk w="the"/> GUE / NGL Group . - ( SV ) This report has the support of the Confederal Group of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="european"/> United Left / Nordic Green <unk w="left"/> .
The sexual exploitation of children and <unk w="child"/> pornography <unk w="for"/> <unk w="of"/> crimes , the prevention of which requires <unk w="serious"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
<unk w="these"/> are violated by being <unk w="forced"/> to pose in sexual contexts , photographed or <unk w="women"/> and posted on <unk w="the"/> <unk w="ground"/> .
These films and images can be seen all <unk w="from"/> the world and <unk w="that"/> <unk w="regional"/> cooperation is therefore needed <unk w="to"/> stop these violations .
The United Nations estimates that 85 % of the victims of the sex slave <unk w="that"/> are children under the age of 18 .
We do not know how many children are bought and sold <unk w="and"/> commodities <unk w="and"/> be sexually exploited , but we do know that it <unk w="is"/> a <unk w="priority"/> , <unk w="and"/> we know that every child that is affected is one child too many .
<unk w="the"/> adult world must take responsibility for protecting our children from this , one of the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> crimes that a child can be subjected to .
In this debate , we must not forget that many of the crimes against children are committed within the family or within the family 's circle of friends and it is therefore important for society <unk w="to"/> <unk w="ensure"/> that children have <unk w="caused"/> adult contacts so that they have someone they can turn to <unk w="their"/> help .
<unk w="these"/> kinds of sexual abuse of children are criminal and must be seen <unk w="as"/> the crimes that they are in all <unk w="member"/> States .
All <unk w="those"/> who commit sexual crimes against children must be punished , regardless <unk w="of"/> whether the crime is committed within or outside the EU .
It is patently obvious <unk w="that"/> the sexual exploitation <unk w="of"/> children should be brought to an end .
The explosive <unk w="increase"/> in criminal activities via the Internet requires a coordinated approach .
We should , however , exercise <unk w="it"/> when it comes to prescribing detailed sentences for this abuse at European level .
Internet child <unk w="pornography"/> <unk w="also"/> need to <unk w="be"/> regulated in the Member States ' criminal law .
The Council should , in line with the prohibition against pursuing one 's <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , commit to closing the loopholes in the legal network , so that exploitation and transmission via the Internet do <unk w="not"/> move to countries where there is no adequate legislation .
I would have liked to hear from the Commission whether it would also be possible to discuss this with <unk w="third"/> countries , but the Council is <unk w="not"/> , unfortunately .
Moreover , I would like <unk w="to"/> argue <unk w="in"/> favour of strengthening cooperation with Europol and Eurojust .
The <unk w="use"/> <unk w="of"/> international child pornography networks <unk w="must"/> be given priority in their <unk w="fields"/> , as indeed , this enhances <unk w="the"/> scope <unk w=","/> <unk w="an"/> appropriate action outside of <unk w="the"/> European Union .
If we are <unk w="now"/> on the undesirability of <unk w="the"/> sexual exploitation of children , I suggest <unk w="and"/> also discuss the exploitation of adults .
<unk w="these"/> initiatives to reduce prostitution at large-scale events , such as <unk w="the"/> championships and <unk w="olympic"/> Games , <unk w="with"/> more support in this Parliament .
( IT ) <unk w="mr"/> President , ladies and gentlemen , paedophile organisations are a threat to citizens and , as such , should be treated <unk w="a"/> mafia or terrorist organisations , with special , severe laws .
It is an outrage <unk w="and"/> <unk w="for"/> <unk w="the"/> thousands of people who have been charged with child pornography offences and have spent not so much <unk w="on"/> a single day in prison .
I <unk w="would"/> also like to remind the rapporteur , Mrs Angelilli , the quality of whose work we have all admired , that in her city last year , there was a case known as ' <unk w="the"/> flower ' , involving 200 Roma <unk w="'"/> .
Once the case was over , these Roma children virtually disappeared ; no one knows whether they in fact went back to the same camps where the abuse took <unk w="place"/> .
All Member States must therefore be vigilant , special legislation must be introduced , and <unk w="the"/> outrage , this horrible threat <unk w="to"/> society , must be addressed with special and extremely severe laws .
( HU ) Mr President , <unk w="commissioner"/> , ladies <unk w="and"/> gentlemen , this House is debating a topic today which rightfully <unk w="in"/> all <unk w="kinds"/> of <unk w="political"/> will .
<unk w="we"/> condemn the phenomenon , and then <unk w=","/> that such trauma <unk w="can"/> only happen to other people 's children .
Yet all our children are in danger , as the <unk w="result"/> of the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography multiply .
We must ensure that the sanctions laid down <unk w="in"/> <unk w="national"/> legal systems are effectively <unk w="implemented"/> , and that daily practice reflects this struggle .
<unk w="member"/> States must do everything possible to eliminate demand entirely .
We must be particularly vigilant regarding the constant challenge posed by the <unk w="development"/> of new online technologies - web cams , mobile phones and , in particular , the use of the Internet - <unk w="in"/> this regard .
The introduction of technologies that block access can be one way of doing this , besides making families and children aware of the <unk w="problem"/> .
In any case , we must emphasise that these are serious crimes , and that in order to detect them , it is essential to <unk w="remove"/> any obstacles <unk w="in"/> <unk w="the"/> way of <unk w="the"/> smooth exchange of law <unk w="and"/> records among Member States , <unk w="to"/> allow <unk w="the"/> creation of centralised databases for information on offenders .
We must make sure <unk w="that"/> <unk w="the"/> safety <unk w="is"/> a central issue in all EU Member States .
( ES ) Mr <unk w="president"/> , sexual <unk w="exploitation"/> is a reality endured by boys and girls all over the world , since there <unk w="is"/> a supply of <unk w="an"/> sexual exploitation , particularly <unk w="the"/> poor countries , and a demand for <unk w="child"/> pornography and sex tourism on the part of rich countries .
With this recommendation , we advocate that real steps be taken : we request European <unk w="lists"/> of differences in the age of consent ; tougher punishments for sexual abuse ; and stronger , increased national intervention programmes and systems .
To achieve this , we must focus attention on Member States so that - as Spain has done , beyond transposing the Council 's framework decision on this matter , - we can develop and implement action plans in which interest groups are involved , including public awareness and social <unk w="security"/> programmes , without neglecting to work on international cooperation .
<unk w="finally"/> , I would like to <unk w="add"/> my voice to <unk w="those"/> urging Member States to sign , ratify and apply all the relevant international <unk w="regulations"/> so that we may guarantee that the rights of minors are respected .
( ET ) <unk w="mr"/> President , Mr Vice-President of the Commission , Mrs Angelilli , ladies and gentlemen , the rapid <unk w="pace"/> of information <unk w="and"/> communication technology has created a new channel for criminals <unk w="to"/> perpetrate or present their crimes .
The <unk w="measures"/> that are the subject of the report have been discussed <unk w="at"/> various global and European forums .
In 2003 , the Council of the European Union passed a binding framework resolution on the sexual exploitation of children <unk w="and"/> the struggle against child pornography , <unk w="and"/> the contents of that resolution have today largely been integrated into Member <unk w="states"/> ' legal systems .
However , <unk w="in"/> connection <unk w="with"/> the rapid development of IT , it needs to be brought up to date and , of course , we <unk w="must"/> <unk w="keep"/> our feet on this .
I am <unk w="convinced"/> that the commission <unk w="will"/> soon have completed a new updated framework resolution .
All Member States must define the concept <unk w="of"/> ' child pornography ' and declare the sexual solicitation of <unk w="children"/> through <unk w="the"/> Internet to be a <unk w="reality"/> .
Harassers operating <unk w="in"/> the Internet are difficult to catch , but it is not impossible .
Thus , surveillance cannot be used in the case of second-degree crimes , and data protection is also often <unk w="very"/> obstruction .
In my home country , there <unk w="have"/> been cases , even recently , where a minor committed suicide due to the activities of <unk w="the"/> Internet harasser .
We must <unk w="be"/> able to <unk w="protect"/> our children before they become victims .
( IT ) Mr <unk w="president"/> , ladies and gentlemen , the sexual exploitation <unk w="of"/> children is a terrible problem .
It is a <unk w="step"/> <unk w="of"/> today 's world and a <unk w="good"/> sign <unk w="of"/> our decline .
A sharp increase has been observed in recent times , due to the vertiginous spread of the Internet and of new and sophisticated <unk w="forms"/> to which children are exposed and to which they have access , <unk w="without"/> any limits , rules , controls or penalties .
These are now more urgently required than ever , <unk w="they"/> must be applied in an increasingly efficient and exemplary fashion .
Mrs Angelilli 's excellent report , on which I warmly congratulate her , <unk w="on"/> the specific recommendations that Parliament will make to the Commission , indicate and suggest measures that <unk w="we"/> genuinely curb the spread of child pornography , online grooming of children , sex <unk w="education"/> and all forms of child abuse .
Recent disturbing data , including a UN study on violence against <unk w="women"/> , indicate that sexual exploitation of children is rapidly increasing and <unk w="which"/> , together with people trafficking , <unk w="which"/> is becoming one of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="energy"/> sources of profit <unk w=","/> one of the fastest growing crimes at transnational level , with a yearly turnover of <unk w="approximately"/> USD 10 billion .
According to an estimate <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="international"/> Labour Organisation , more than 12 million people are victims of forced labour , of whom more than 1 million are involved in sexual exploitation and between 45 % and 50 % are children .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the proposal for a European <unk w="council"/> recommendation to the Council <unk w="on"/> combating the sexual exploitation of children and <unk w="child"/> pornography in <unk w="colombia"/> is <unk w="caused"/> by the <unk w="current"/> <unk w="series"/> of new telecommunication <unk w="technologies"/> .
Forms of online grooming of children have certainly increased , but I would like to take this opportunity to <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> the exploitation of images of women also .
In the majority <unk w="of"/> EU countries , an often disgusting view of womanhood is propagated , where the commercial aim is pursued not only with vulgarity but with a real contempt for women 's dignity , not to mention the use of subliminal advertising and also television programming - above all in my country , I have to say .
I agree <unk w="with"/> the rapporteur that <unk w="the"/> Framework Decision 2004 / 68 should be updated to increase the level of protection for children <unk w="to"/> <unk w="and"/> better combat sexual exploitation <unk w="in"/> general .
The ratification of the Council of Europe Convention is just as <unk w="important"/> , but we must not stop there : we <unk w="also"/> need to criminalise the online grooming of <unk w="freedom"/> and press for cross-border cooperation in <unk w="this"/> field .
In my opinion , Member States should be obliged to exchange the information contained in criminal records relating to sexual abuse convictions - and I believe that the ECRIS system is certainly a step forward on this front - in order to prevent those who have committed <unk w="such"/> crimes from having contact with children and therefore to improve protection <unk w="for"/> victims , <unk w="not"/> just during investigations , but <unk w="also"/> after trials have been concluded .
I would <unk w="like"/> to close <unk w="by"/> emphasising that forms <unk w="of"/> child exploitation unfortunately encompass <unk w="more"/> than just sexual abuse , and I would like to see a greater commitment from our institutions on those <unk w="important"/> areas .
( EL ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , <unk w="first"/> of all , I should like to <unk w="congratulate"/> Mrs Angelilli on her exceptional work on such a sensitive issue which concerns us all .
The sexual exploitation of children <unk w="is"/> a phenomenon which continues to shock society in the Member States of the European Union and elsewhere .
Child pornography on the Internet is a worsening problem if you think that , between 1997 and 2007 , the number of websites <unk w="and"/> the sexual exploitation of <unk w="the"/> increased one thousand per <unk w="year"/> .
Reinforced cooperation with the private sector could make <unk w="an"/> effective contribution towards limiting the number of websites hosting child pornography .
For example , cooperation <unk w="should"/> be promoted with credit card companies to fight child pornography on the <unk w="roads"/> at European level by using their systems for <unk w="access"/> to commercial <unk w="and"/> selling photographs <unk w="and"/> children .
In addition , the new Community programme to protect children using the Internet <unk w="and"/> help to promote a <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> online environment .
The Council of <unk w="europe"/> Convention <unk w="signed"/> by 20 Member States of the European Union is the first international legal act qualifying the various forms of sexual exploitation <unk w="of"/> children as a criminal offence .
In order to deal <unk w="quickly"/> with <unk w="this"/> phenomenon , Member States need to criminalise every form of coercion of children to take part in sexual activities .
Finally , I <unk w="find"/> it very important to take account of paedophile registers and to prohibit them from accessing jobs or <unk w="the"/> work which brings them into direct contact with minors .
( HU ) Thank you very much , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , around the world , some 40 million <unk w=","/> under the age of 12 are the victims of some form of violent act .
Given <unk w="that"/> the new technologies and , in particular , the constant development of the Internet and the new online methods used by paedophiles , <unk w="it"/> is of paramount importance <unk w="to"/> the level of child protection <unk w="has"/> increased .
According to Eurobarometer , 74 % of underage children use <unk w="the"/> Internet on a daily basis , and <unk w="how"/> many of them are exposed <unk w="to"/> <unk w="unacceptable"/> or pornographic elements .
In the interests of effective protection , I <unk w="would"/> like to <unk w="highlight"/> the introduction of the so-called <unk w="'"/> family information packages in Europe .
These are already widely used by certain European Internet service providers , and I believe that others can also become partners <unk w="in"/> this effort .
The packages address four basic safety topics - safety and communication , entertainment , <unk w="education"/> , and virtual violence , and , <unk w="in"/> a playful <unk w="state"/> , offer families help <unk w="to"/> the <unk w="better"/> use of the Internet .
I further recommend that these packages contain a free , child-friendly Internet browser <unk w="which"/> could serve <unk w="as"/> a web filter , to keep children away <unk w="an"/> undesirable content on the World Wide Web .
We <unk w="must"/> be sure that our children are safe , not <unk w="only"/> on the Internet , but in <unk w="public"/> and private institutions as well .
Therefore , it is of paramount importance that <unk w="countries"/> whose work involves regular contact with children be <unk w="prepared"/> to report any situation in which sexual abuse has occurred .
( RO ) Sexual exploitation of children and child pornography are very <unk w="serious"/> crimes .
Although legislation in many European Union countries is sufficiently stringent , there are still many measures which need to be taken to guarantee children <unk w="'s"/> protection .
All Member States should ratify the Council of Europe Convention and implement in full the framework decision in order to establish a united approach <unk w="the"/> European Union <unk w="policy"/> .
Illegal material <unk w="on"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="it"/> should be removed from <unk w="the"/> Internet at source and <unk w="it"/> should be <unk w="done"/> by providers .
Indeed , the telecom legislation review which we are debating at the moment in the <unk w="european"/> Parliament , along with the Council and Commission , offers a <unk w="good"/> opportunity to improve the legislation .
Perpetrators of sexual abuse should be denied <unk w="the"/> opportunity to pursue professional activities <unk w="and"/> involve contact with children .
Finally , I believe that the European Commission and Member States <unk w="must"/> provide financial and logistical support for <unk w="information"/> campaigns aimed at parents and children .
( PL ) Mr President , I am very pleased that <unk w="it"/> has taken up <unk w="the"/> question of combating <unk w="the"/> sexual exploitation of children and child pornography seriously .
I am especially pleased because , until now , many <unk w="political"/> groups in Europe have been fighting <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> greatest possible sexual <unk w="exploitation"/> , while not giving <unk w="rise"/> to the consequences of this course of action in relation to <unk w="it"/> .
There have <unk w="therefore"/> been attempts to form paedophile political parties .
This <unk w="will"/> fill every decent citizen of the European Union with horror .
Taking the opportunity of this discussion , attention should be drawn to the violation of children 's rights <unk w="and"/> the sexual <unk w="exploitation"/> of children of immigrants from outside Europe .
The fact that it is <unk w="not"/> in their home countries is one thing , but when they are living in the countries of <unk w="the"/> European Union , <unk w="we"/> must rigorously comply with the prevailing law or leave Europe .
There cannot be some laws for the traditional peoples of Europe and <unk w="especially"/> for immigrants .
( CS ) Mr President , ladies and <unk w="gentlemen"/> , this is undoubtedly an important issue requiring effective cooperation by all Member States .
I would like to <unk w="point"/> out that the protection of children from abuse in a modern society has weakened in many respects .
The reasons range from increasing family <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and the growing number of children brought up in single-parent families , to greater mobility of citizens and the spread of modern information technologies .
<unk w="that"/> is why I am strongly in favour of the report .
