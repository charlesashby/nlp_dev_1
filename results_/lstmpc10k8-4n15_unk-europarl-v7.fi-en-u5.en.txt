<unk w="however"/> , in <unk w="view"/> of the shortage of <unk w="all"/> credit , there <unk w="is"/> a threat of energy and food crises .
In order to maintain at least the current level of energy production , there will be a need by 2030 for worldwide investment of about USD 26 billion in reconstruction and the development of new oil and gas fields and also <unk w="on"/> the production and distribution of all types of energy .
At <unk w="the"/> same time it will be necessary to integrate the flows of oil , gas and electricity so as to create an efficient and highly diversified system .
This <unk w="means"/> must help to overcome consequences of local political disputes and also consequences of any natural disasters and to provide for a functioning energy supply in a Europe-wide context .
<unk w="the"/> Slovak Republic itself has had the opportunity in recent weeks to experience the complexity of such a situation when , as a result <unk w="of"/> the conflict between Ukraine and Russia , not a single cubic metre of gas reached Slovakia for several days .
The experience <unk w="of"/> Slovakia and also of other European countries has shown that vigorous support is needed for <unk w="the"/> European Union 's priority of interconnecting and integrating the <unk w="new"/> energy markets in Europe .
<unk w="finally"/> , I must mention that the enforced and premature decommissioning of two reactors at the Jaslovské Bohunice nuclear power plant has been found to be an imprudent mistake in the current situation .
( EL ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the battle against climate change and the need for energy security and <unk w="to"/> strengthen <unk w="the"/> competitiveness of our economy are taking us <unk w="along"/> <unk w="the"/> road of the third industrial revolution , towards an era in which we wean <unk w="better"/> off mineral fuels .
It is a real revolution which will bring about huge <unk w="structural"/> changes to the model of production and consumption and , <unk w="hence"/> , to our very way of life .
In order for that to happen , we shall <unk w="continue"/> to make every possible effort to limit the energy intensity of the economy in all sectors .
<unk w="more"/> incentives are needed in order for us to make use of these technologies , so that <unk w="we"/> increase the energy efficiency of the European Union by 20 % by 2020 , within the framework of the <unk w="future"/> target .
The motion which we are being called on to adopt in a couple of <unk w="years"/> ' time and which relates to the strengthening of energy efficiency through ICT places particular <unk w="emphasis"/> on research and development of pioneering technologies , such as nano-technologies and photonic technology , which <unk w="is"/> high <unk w="results"/> to improve energy efficiency , and on designing policies to strengthen the take-up of these technologies .
Finally , the motion provides for incentives for <unk w="innovative"/> and integrated energy management systems in our cities and for smart traffic management systems with more <unk w="small"/> road behaviour and transport systems .
It is clear from what I have said that , although it is not <unk w="possible"/> , this motion which we shall vote <unk w=","/> in a couple of days ' time is highly important , because it essentially <unk w="makes"/> ICT one of the main indicators of sustainable development in the European Union .
( DE ) Mr President , we are , I hope , all clear on what the priorities are here : energy efficiency , energy saving <unk w="and"/> renewable energy .
Nevertheless , we cannot get round the fact that <unk w="we"/> will need to worry about our gas supplies for many more years yet .
So , what <unk w="else"/> can we learn from the dispute between Ukraine and Russia , and from the crisis that arose from that dispute ?
<unk w="in"/> my view - and I am sorry to have to say this , Commissioner - it seems to me that we will be no better , or at least not much better , prepared <unk w="the"/> next <unk w="year"/> this happens .
Neither can it <unk w="be"/> said that the crisis is over , <unk w="and"/> I have seen little sign that a strategy <unk w="is"/> really being developed , or that any conclusions have been drawn from this dispute between Ukraine and Russia .
Certain Members of this House believe <unk w="that"/> we should conclude bilateral agreements with Ukraine , but <unk w="it"/> should be pointed out that Ukraine has to bear at least some of the blame for the situation that arose recently , and I would really rather not make myself dependent on arguments between Mr Yushchenko and Mrs Tymoshenko , <unk w="and"/> Mr Yanukovych , or whoever .
Ukraine would , quite naturally , clearly much rather buy the gas from Russia and then sell it on to us , naturally for an <unk w="absolute"/> charge , <unk w="which"/> would Turkey in <unk w="order"/> to Nabucco , but I will return to that later .
If , then , we want our gas to be just as insecure , but more <unk w="importantly"/> , we should make a bilateral agreement <unk w="there"/> , if we want to find a real solution , we need to make a <unk w="clear"/> agreement encompassing Russia as the supplier , Ukraine as the transit country and <unk w="germany"/> , and come to an agreement in this <unk w="domain"/> , particularly with regard to <unk w="transport"/> and infrastructure .
With regard to investments in infrastructure , if we look to the east , there are basically three <unk w="things"/> up for discussion : Nord Stream , South Stream and Nabucco .
South Stream may also solve a transit problem , <unk w="once"/> again will not reduce our dependency on Russia .
On top of that , if one looks at the costs involved , South Stream is actually somewhat more expensive than Nabucco , at least <unk w="according"/> to a number of studies , which suggests that we need to invest massively in Nabucco .
When I consider - and I have mentioned this on a few previous occasions as well , Commissioner - how quickly the United States constructed the <unk w="olympic"/> oil pipeline and how long we are taking over the <unk w="overall"/> gas pipeline , I really do think it is <unk w="a"/> <unk w="that"/> little Europe has achieved : <unk w="there"/> is a sign <unk w="of"/> our weakness .
<unk w="we"/> need to <unk w=","/> quickly , not just <unk w="with"/> regard to Azerbaijan or Turkmenistan - which we will be discussing shortly - but also <unk w="in"/> relation to Iraq .
The fact that gas there is simply being released into the air as exhaust , with no consideration being given to how <unk w="it"/> could be transported <unk w="to"/> the Nabucco pipeline , really is a big mistake .
I would ask you , Commissioner , <unk w="to"/> negotiate quickly and clearly with Turkey , in order to ensure <unk w="that"/> we also get their agreement to this .
We will , of course , also <unk w="try"/> to convince Cyprus to <unk w="be"/> blocking the energy chapter : their insistence that we cannot even negotiate on this chapter shows a lack of solidarity , because it quite naturally causes difficulties with Turkey .
You are nodding , Commissioner ; I <unk w="believe"/> that we are in full agreement here .
Turning finally to nuclear energy , there are some <unk w="very"/> different opinions on this subject in this House .
Unfortunately , I <unk w="too"/> cannot vote in favour of the Laperrouze report , for example because it is too one-sided in this respect .
That is not the way to <unk w="tackle"/> the problem , particularly with regard to <unk w="guinea"/> .
We will need <unk w="to"/> <unk w="do"/> a lot more energy and brainpower to solving the problem of waste <unk w="and"/> disposal .
This crisis shows that we should stake everything on the building of an independent infrastructure which will <unk w="enable"/> us to independent sources of the raw materials for energy in Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan .
The crisis shows that we should strike the northern gas pipeline off the list <unk w="of"/> European Commission priorities in order to avoid a Russian monopoly in Europe .
Solving the energy problem will be a critical moment <unk w="on"/> the entire integration process .
The EU has the chance to show its <unk w="interest"/> and to gain new <unk w="information"/> .
( ES ) Mr President , I would like to talk about the need to fuse the information technology revolution of the information society with the energy revolution , <unk w="which"/> has been the subject <unk w="of"/> an excellent resolution of the House .
We need consumption that is managed in <unk w="of"/> with production .
This smart consumption <unk w="can"/> only <unk w="be"/> provided <unk w="by"/> the Internet and only by the fusion of all electrical networks with the information coming from houses , factories , buildings and so on .
In this way we could be much <unk w="more"/> autonomous , much more <unk w="importantly"/> , and Europe could take a leading role in this essential global issue so that there would not have to be dozens of unnecessary power stations as is the case today .
<unk w="in"/> this way <unk w="we"/> could also cooperate with neighbouring countries in the Mediterranean .
This <unk w="would"/> be an excellent opportunity for cooperation on technology transparency .
Let me make a few points on the Strategic Energy Review and the last energy crisis <unk w="management"/> , which are closely linked .
My first point : in our report , which calls on the Member States to speak with a single European voice on energy issues , we have explicitly stated what all Europeans have seen in the past weeks <unk w="to"/> be the reality , namely that damaging energy supply in the Member States afflicts the European Union as a whole .
<unk w="this"/> is the basis of European solidarity and a basis for developing emergency response measures .
My second point is <unk w="that"/> the report mentions CCS <unk w=","/> as having the potential to meet our environmental targets while exploiting a source of energy - coal - that <unk w="is"/> largely available in Europe .
By developing CCS , Europe can <unk w="be"/> a world leader in advanced technologies , which will contribute to our global competitiveness and strengthen our economies .
The same is true for coal gasification technology , which is very important as an additional source of gas <unk w="costs"/> - it means diversification of gas supply .
Infrastructure projects <unk w="will"/> receive support at EU level should first and foremost contribute to the real diversification of sources and routes of supplies to the Member States and to the EU as a whole .
<unk w="the"/> reason for such a step on our part is very simple .
It has ratified the Energy Charter Treaty and , therefore , plays by transparent <unk w="means"/> .
It means a working internal market in energy for the European <unk w="union"/> ; it means solidarity and support on <unk w="both"/> sides .
After all , our energy networks were built to <unk w="meet"/> the needs of the Cold War and for those political circumstances . Now they have improved and <unk w="has"/> been patched up here and there , but this has caused us a problem that we will have to return to again later on .
As the need for energy has grown dramatically while the economy has developed at a huge rate , <unk w="in"/> the price , <unk w="health"/> and environmental problems have also changed .
It is therefore important that we involve the United States and <unk w="the"/> developing countries in a common energy process .
We need energy diplomacy for the simple reason that these are such big issues that there have been wars over <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> before and there will be again in the future .
It is also quite obvious that we need <unk w="a"/> energy mix comprising various energy sources that is as broadly based as possible , because that will stabilise the energy situation and as a result each nation 's diversity , and Europe 's too , will come into its own .
Luckily , smart technology has developed <unk w="not"/> just the same time .
People and companies do not know about the energy they <unk w="are"/> consuming without smart technology .
Consequently , information and communication technologies ( ITC ) are the <unk w="possibility"/> that will help <unk w="to"/> reach targets and keep us in order .
They are therefore like a good teacher , but also a good hired hand because intelligence is not just needed for the network , <unk w="but"/> also for equipment , <unk w="recycling"/> and cars .
Everywhere there <unk w="is"/> human activity , intelligence is needed to control energy consumption .
In this connection , I would stress in particular the importance of the small and medium-sized enterprise sector and the innovations that come from this , <unk w="but"/> <unk w="it"/> can be truly inventive .
We find <unk w="it"/> odd that Ukraine is a transit country .
Madam President , in all the discussions on the energy crisis , there is <unk w="one"/> aspect which my colleague , Anne Laperrouze , does mention , but which generally receives <unk w="more"/> attention .
We talk about energy efficiency in the context of climate change and of fuel poverty , but energy efficiency is <unk w="one"/> of huge strategic importance .
Controlling demand takes pressure off the supply side and is crucial to <unk w="renewable"/> energy independence in Europe .
I <unk w="wish"/> to make two specific points in the context of the oral question on the use of information and communication technologies .
First , I am concerned that the roll-out of smart meters is not going ahead with the degree of commitment <unk w="made"/> by the Energy End-Use Efficiency and Energy Services Directive and called for in the Morgan report .
In some countries , digital displays are available to show <unk w="just"/> how much energy they are using - which is helpful - but a proper smart meter does much <unk w="more"/> than that .
It allows two-way communication , detailed analysis of consumer demand and proper measurement <unk w="of"/> payment of electricity supplied by micro-renewables .
They are crucial to the <unk w="process"/> of transforming <unk w="information"/> from being energy consumers into being net energy producers .
Secondly , with regard to lighting , I trust we are about to go ahead with taking the most inefficient domestic lighting off the <unk w="ground"/> , and the same <unk w="thing"/> <unk w="will"/> happen for office and street lighting .
We should , however , <unk w="also"/> be looking forward to the next technological steps , <unk w="such"/> as wider use of smart lighting systems using sensors , which <unk w="provide"/> movement and the degree of natural light so that lighting can be reduced - or indeed switched off when necessary .
There is a lot more <unk w="of"/> energy-efficient lighting than compact fluorescents , and it is time for the public sector - and that includes the European institutions - to take the lead on using ICT for energy efficiency .
( LV ) <unk w="mr"/> President , Commissioners , I <unk w="would"/> firstly like to thank Mrs Laperrouze for her extremely comprehensive report .
<unk w="we"/> <unk w="will"/> provide the opportunity to take important decisions that may crucially change our values and policies .
I <unk w="find"/> reason to believe that the <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> gas crisis has opened the eyes of politicians in relation to the vulnerability of <unk w="all"/> parts of Europe with regard to energy supply .
Not only the recovery plan <unk w="and"/> the Second Strategic Energy Review prepared by the Commission <unk w="but"/> also this report all give us hope that there will be a unified European energy policy , and that includes the hope that the isolated energy islands of Europe will at last be eliminated , including that of the Baltic States .
These could indeed become an alternative to supplies of Russian gas <unk w="in"/> many locations , but only on condition that national governments are able to withstand the pressure , and not create them as extra capacity for the export of Russian gas , but solely as import terminals .
( DE ) <unk w="mr"/> President , Mr Piebalgs , Mrs Reding , <unk w="ladies"/> and gentlemen , we need investment now .
We <unk w="need"/> to make an <unk w="effort"/> to invest as <unk w=","/> and as well as possible , <unk w="and"/> therefore we cannot but say ' yes ' to the construction not only of pipelines but also of LNG ships .
The pipelines should not compete with each other ; rather , the construction of <unk w="the"/> new pipeline is a win-win situation , as is the <unk w="case"/> <unk w="of"/> LNG terminals .
If we could give every citizen <unk w="an"/> allowance of EUR 10 <unk w="million"/> a year that they could offset against tax , we could make an immediate start on investing in energy <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> energy ; with regard to the latter , progressive depreciation , in other words the immediate inclusion of costs on the balance sheet , would be a particularly valuable tool .
If we could set a three-year limit <unk w="for"/> this , it would be a great success for all of us .
We could get a better <unk w="debate"/> on employment and energy .
One point which particularly exercises us in this programme is , quite naturally , the nuclear industry : it is <unk w="necessary"/> to ensure the safety and security of nuclear power <unk w="stations"/> , <unk w="and"/> to do so to the very best of our ability .
It is not possible <unk w="to"/> set the bar too high here : quite simply , we need people to trust in the European Union that the appropriate steps <unk w="can"/> be taken , that further security research will be conducted and that there will be legally binding requirements allowing dangerous nuclear power stations to be removed from the grid immediately following a ruling by a court or regulator .
The people of Europe have a right to safety in this field , so that we can go forward into a <unk w="situation"/> in which energy generation <unk w="has"/> not put us in danger and we can sleep soundly .
Ultimately , however , it will also be up to the Council , in the group responsible for nuclear safety , to <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> up to <unk w="their"/> responsibilities and not to go down a path that the citizens will not appreciate , by blocking proposals from the European Parliament and the Commission .
( ES ) Madam President , Commissioners , the recent situation concerning <unk w="russia"/> and Ukraine and the gas <unk w="sector"/> has clearly shown that more than ever before we need to diversify our supply and improve connections between Member States and with producer countries .
The Commission 's proposals are heading in this direction , but in the interests of greater efficacy these <unk w="policies"/> should also include , and I was glad to <unk w="hear"/> the Commissioner mention it today , the potential in the south of our continent and in particular <unk w="in"/> my <unk w="country"/> , Spain .
Spain is the Member State with the greatest diversification of <unk w="energy"/> , both in terms of the number of countries - <unk w="that"/> gas is imported from 10 different countries - as well as in the range of formats .
The supply is achieved both through the gas pipeline <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> Algeria as well as by liquefied natural gas in similar volumes to that of Nabucco , but at a lower cost and with better delivery times .
If the Iberian peninsular clearly suffers from isolation in energy terms , islands such as the Balearic Islands , where I am from , <unk w="with"/> a double isolation .
I sincerely request , Mr Piebalgs , that <unk w="we"/> consider the particular situation of island territories when taking decisions and establishing priorities .
( SV ) Madam <unk w="president"/> , Commissioner , the EU has had to learn the hard way what it means to be far too dependent on a single energy supplier .
We know that Russia <unk w="is"/> ruthless when dealing with its neighbours , but when freezing Slovakians and Bulgarians were taken hostage in the quarrel between Russia and Ukraine it was , hopefully , a wake-up call for all of us , including us here in this Parliament .
<unk w="it"/> needs the support of the EU , and the <unk w="lack"/> of <unk w="electricity"/> with gas from Azerbaijan , among others , must now get underway .
The <unk w="eu"/> must now demonstrate an ability <unk w="to"/> take action , precisely <unk w="the"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> for by Mr Swoboda .
We know that Russia is pressing for Nord Stream , the gas pipeline <unk w="and"/> the Baltic Sea .
The Baltic Sea is one of our <unk w="most"/> sensitive inland seas .
I am pleased to see that the report maintains that nuclear <unk w="energy"/> needs to be an important part of Europe 's future energy mix .
If we are to meet the emissions <unk w="and"/> requirements of the <unk w="railway"/> package we need modern European nuclear energy .
Firstly , the European Union does <unk w="not"/> have an energy strategy .
Secondly , the EU has succumbed to <unk w="genetic"/> manipulation <unk w="of"/> the form of intimidation with global climate warming due to CO2 emissions .
With regard to those who are spreading this theory and intimidating us with global <unk w="interest"/> , it would be <unk w="an"/> investigating in whose interests they are acting .
Thirdly , the EU requires an energy strategy based on the principle of the weakest link , <unk w="in"/> <unk w="other"/> words help in the form of financial aid and investment in those countries which are most dependent on one supplier , like the Baltic States <unk w="and"/> Poland .
Fourthly , the EU needs to apologise and <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> hard coal and brown coal to favour , because it has plentiful supplies of these and they are cheap .
( DE ) Madam <unk w="president"/> , ladies and gentlemen , first <unk w="of"/> all I would very <unk w="much"/> like to thank Mrs Laperrouze and Mr Piebalgs for all the documents they have presented .
As has been said , one might not agree with every single point , but the report is generally correct , contrary to <unk w="what"/> Mr Turmes just suggested .
<unk w="mr"/> <unk w="however"/> , it is wrong to believe that <unk w="there"/> is a simple answer , a single answer to this <unk w="question"/> , complicated problem .
Politicians always try to give a <unk w="clear"/> , simple answer that satisfies everybody , but that is just not possible .
We cannot make people promises and act <unk w="quickly"/> if <unk w="we"/> have a solution and everything is magically going to be fine ; quite apart from anything else , the people <unk w="of"/> one day be bitterly disappointed when they realised that it does not work that way .
This nuance means that there is not just a single energy source , but rather that we will continue <unk w="for"/> a long time to work with several sources .
It is part of <unk w="the"/> solution : not the <unk w="only"/> solution , of course , but <unk w="it"/> should be realised that it has a contribution to make .
I would also caution against staking too much on gas : we <unk w="have"/> just heard a great deal about the dependency that entails .
I also think that <unk w="we"/> need to realise that <unk w="we"/> cannot just <unk w="just"/> give up on coal - an energy source that we have in our country and in many other places in Europe - and say ' coal produces CO2 , so it is not an option ' .
As <unk w="mr"/> Rübig just said , there is <unk w="not"/> one single answer for a pipeline : it <unk w="would"/> be a mistake to just opt for one ; instead , we need to open up a variety of routes and options .
In <unk w="this"/> respect , the path we need to take is <unk w="to"/> say ' yes ' to intelligent solutions .
The answer is investing in research and being open to solutions that we currently cannot see at all , and not casually ruling <unk w="from"/> one option or another .
It would be a fatal mistake - and <unk w="this"/> is one made in some energy <unk w="policy"/> decisions - to give those who actually have to invest the money , namely companies , too little room for manoeuvre and too little support .
Does anybody really believe that we , the Member States , the <unk w="council"/> or the Community will be able to solve the problem of investment ?
( BG ) Madam President , Commissioners , first of all I would like to highlight the constructive debate in the Committee on <unk w="trade"/> , Research and Energy on the report by Mrs Laperrouze , and <unk w="to"/> point out her role in <unk w="such"/> an objective and all-encompassing report .
I want to especially concentrate on the <unk w="points"/> included in <unk w="the"/> report which have been made with the aim of reflecting the problems faced by those <unk w="countries"/> which are most deeply affected <unk w="by"/> external energy source suppliers , in particular gas .
First of all , the importance of the European Parliament actively participating in <unk w="pilot"/> projects for new energy links , in particular between Member States ' gas and energy supply networks , has been noted .
However , it <unk w="is"/> with regret that I point out that <unk w="the"/> EUR <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> million has been set aside for the Commission 's project for the Republic of Bulgaria and its links with Greece , despite Bulgaria being one of the most seriously affected countries .
The gas field in Chiren , for example , which will solve the problems <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> crisis with minimum supplies , has not been mentioned at all .
Secondly , <unk w="the"/> possibilities for constructing the southern gas corridor have been included , in other words , in addition to the Nabucco project , the South Stream and TGI projects are also noted .
Thirdly , the importance of liquefied gas terminals being constructed in the European Union is emphasised , and also that they should be accessible to all Member States on the basis of the <unk w="principles"/> of solidarity .
This is <unk w="once"/> again particularly important for the joint use of such terminals by <unk w="portugal"/> and Greece .
Fourthly , I <unk w="call"/> upon the Commission to look into expanding the energy community in South East Europe and other neighbouring countries with the aim of forming a single market for the whole region .
It is clear <unk w="that"/> politically based decisions like those taken in relation to Kozloduy cannot <unk w="be"/> long-term ones in the current development <unk w="of"/> energy <unk w="production"/> in the European Union .
I <unk w="hope"/> that Member States will be in the position , based on objective criteria , to reconsider the issue about the closed reactors .
The excruciating and <unk w="the"/> experience of our countries in the South in January , like the forecasts that threaten us with a significant energy shortage over the next two decades , all point towards the need for energy policy to be a key part of <unk w="european"/> foreign policy .
Its sources of supply in Azerbaijan risk being seized by its rival , which makes it a precarious and dubious <unk w="way"/> .
<unk w="in"/> this way the Union is probably going to lose the unique opportunity of diversity <unk w="and"/> greater security ...
( HU ) Madam President , the Second Strategic Energy Review could not be more <unk w="effective"/> .
In order to be able truly to guarantee security of supply , we need to learn <unk w="the"/> lessons of the gas dispute .
By this I mean first of all the diversification of the energy types used , the <unk w="security"/> of supply and delivery routes .
According to calculations , Europe uses 500 billion m ³ of gas per <unk w="year"/> , and this demand may grow , according to certain analyses , by as <unk w="much"/> as 30 % in the next 20 years .
The Nord Stream pipeline transporting Russian gas to Europe is already under construction , and the Blue Stream in Turkey is ready ; agreement has been reached by <unk w="the"/> interested parties on the building of South Stream , Ukraine has undertaken the creation of White Stream , and then there is the much talked-about Nabucco , albeit with uncertain sources or financial backing .
Many may say that , <unk w="at"/> the moment , we can trust that the negotiations of the European Commissioners and the Russian delegation at the Moscow summit will bring substantive results and lead to significant progress as regards the gas pipelines , and that in future it will not be the Russian gas monopoly alone that dictates prices .
This is possible , but for my part , in addition to all this - and indeed before all else - I believe that the way <unk w="forward"/> is to use less and cleaner energy .
This is precisely why I maintain that there is a need for a European <unk w="union"/> ' New Deal ' , in other words , <unk w="and"/> that aims at sustainable growth while stimulating and utilising innovation in environmental industry .
Increasing numbers of people are recognising that , in order to <unk w="move"/> from the global crisis , a fresh driving force is necessary , with an engine running on new organisational principles .
More and more people are recognising the need <unk w="for"/> a paradigm <unk w="solution"/> .
The green ' New Deal ' , in other <unk w="words"/> a new logic for economic organisation based on innovations in <unk w="digital"/> technology and supported by international capital markets , will become the cornerstone of increasing numbers of economic rescue and stimulus <unk w="for"/> , including among the European Union <unk w="member"/> States .
<unk w="we"/> need this stimulus because last year the number of <unk w="million"/> unemployed in Europe grew by 1.7 million .
<unk w="the"/> European green ' New Deal ' , should it receive the green light , will have a fundamental effect on Europe 's future energy policy .
The Union 's dependence on imports of conventional sources of energy and on a limited number of suppliers represents a serious threat to our <unk w="peace"/> , stability and prosperity .
In the internal market there is a need for a clear and stable legal framework and , above all , a need to complete the integration of our <unk w="community"/> <unk w="and"/> throughout the <unk w="whole"/> of the European Union .
The clause on mutual solidarity <unk w="will"/> remain <unk w="in"/> an empty phrase <unk w="unless"/> we do not connect these <unk w="legal"/> systems .
There is <unk w="also"/> a need to strengthen the use of all domestic energy sources , from conservation by increasing <unk w="the"/> proportion of renewable sources to greater use of safe nuclear energy .
There <unk w="is"/> no need <unk w="to"/> emphasise that financial investment in our domestic energy industry will also provide a return in the form of a resumption <unk w="of"/> economic growth .
As far as <unk w="economic"/> relations in the field of energy are concerned , this aspect too requires far greater diversification than before .
There is a need for a more intensive dialogue with producer <unk w="countries"/> , transit countries and other consumer <unk w="organisations"/> .
Cooperation should be <unk w="compatible"/> with the countries of the <unk w="middle"/> East , the Mediterranean region and North Africa .
The dialogue should also include <unk w="a"/> candidate country Turkey and , in my view , it is also essential to look for a far more effective approach to countries like Iran .
In conclusion I should like to congratulate our rapporteur Mrs Laperrouze on , I believe , a <unk w="fair"/> and balanced <unk w="solution"/> .
( LT ) Although we started talking about the need <unk w="for"/> a common energy policy as far back as 2006 , each individual EU State is responsible for ensuring a <unk w="future"/> energy supply .
However , solidarity among the Member States is essential for the survival of <unk w="the"/> EU itself .
I am delighted that among the infrastructure projects set to become EU energy security priorities <unk w="and"/> an interconnection plan for the <unk w="countries"/> around <unk w="the"/> Baltic Sea , which would eliminate the insecure energy islands still existing in the EU .
I would <unk w="like"/> to ask the Commission for all kinds of support in the construction of the energy <unk w="sector"/> between Lithuania <unk w="and"/> Sweden and the Lithuanian-Polish energy bridge .
We are debating the Third Energy Package , involving the <unk w="establishment"/> of an EU internal electricity and gas market with an <unk w="opportunity"/> for the Cooperation of <unk w="national"/> Regulators .
How is this consistent with <unk w="the"/> Member State solidarity , the common energy policy and energy security ?
Not only did the last gas conflict between Russia and Ukraine <unk w="and"/> huge economic losses in many EU countries , but with a kind of permission from the EU it once again pushed Ukraine into a clear economic dependence on Russia .
For it is difficult to imagine that the Ukrainian economy will be able to function <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="price"/> of gas <unk w="consumption"/> over USD 400 per 1 000 cubic metres .
Thirdly and finally , the European <unk w="union"/> , by using its own <unk w="land"/> means and also the European Investment Bank , should <unk w=","/> first and foremost <unk w="through"/> investments which really diversify <unk w="the"/> supply of gas to the EU , and so which create a real capability to import gas from countries other than Russia , such as <unk w="the"/> Nabucco <unk w="in"/> pipeline .
Madam President , we will never achieve either energy security or the 80 % reduction in our carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 if we continue to effectively ignore both <unk w="the"/> issue of energy security and the critical importance of pan-European high-voltage direct current ( HVDC ) interconnection .
That includes an HVDC line to North Africa : smart electrical networks over <unk w="europe"/> and North Africa .
Having had the opportunity last week to experience first <unk w="of"/> the exciting solar thermal operations in Grenada and Seville , and having read over the weekend Harvard professor Michael McElroy 's views on freeing the United States from <unk w="approximately"/> USD 750 billion annual bill for importing oil , winning the energy security battle in the US and at the same time saving the planet , I ask myself : what are we still debating ?
If the wind is not blowing off the Irish west coast , the sun will be <unk w="killed"/> in Spain , or the wind <unk w="would"/> be blowing off the <unk w="french"/> coast of North <unk w=","/> as well as the sun shining there .
In short , what the sun <unk w="responded"/> to Spain , wind is to the west coast of Ireland .
Our national regulators will <unk w="be"/> <unk w="it"/> as their only job as of now if to keep the lights on and our homes and offices heated at peak demand .
Wind energy is <unk w="increasing"/> with coal , oil and gas , and the fuel is free .
I conclude : the glib expression ' to <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> the earth ' which we - English-language speakers anyway - use figuratively with gay abandon now needs to be taken literally .
( BG ) Madam President , as shadow rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs , I would like to congratulate Mrs Laperrouze on this report , which gives a wide perspective on the European Union 's problems in <unk w="the"/> field of <unk w="education"/> , <unk w="and"/> the need <unk w="for"/> a common energy policy .
The report also very clearly indicates the actions which need to be implemented <unk w="so"/> that we can face the challenges of energy security .
On the other <unk w="hand"/> , for the future we need to continue working towards more alternative corridors , <unk w="air"/> corridors , and not just one corridor at <unk w="the"/> expense of another .
In <unk w="the"/> last year I noticed here , in this <unk w="chamber"/> , that the Nabucco energy project was still ' smoke without fire ' .
<unk w="i"/> can now say that <unk w="community"/> action is being taken by the Commission in this direction .
However it needs to be clear that , despite the actions and measures taken on the road to achieving ever greater energy security , much more effort is needed , <unk w="a"/> serious political activity , so that we can see the light at <unk w="the"/> end of the <unk w="day"/> .
I would like to tell <unk w="you"/> that Bulgaria would have been doomed had it not had capacity for at least 20 days ' reserve supplies at the gas storage facility in Chiren , which last year , as if the government knew what was coming , was <unk w="caused"/> by one-third of its <unk w="terrorism"/> .
Therefore , for the second time today , I would stress my <unk w="the"/> lack of understanding why the Commission has completely ignored the project proposed by <unk w="parliament"/> for <unk w="the"/> expansion of this storage facility .
( PL ) Madam President , the gas crisis and the financial crisis are forcing us to take rapid and pragmatic <unk w="action"/> which is above individual interests and ideas <unk w="which"/> are economically unjustified , such as the Nord Stream pipeline .
The Second Strategic Energy Review does <unk w="not"/> give the desired added value .
The citizens and the economy of the <unk w="union"/> require <unk w="different"/> and specific decisions and action which will ensure relatively low and stable energy costs over the next 15 years : decisions which will lead to the most significant savings possible in industry , transport <unk w="and"/> homes ; decisions which will in large measure reduce the dependence of the EU economy <unk w="and"/> the import of hydrocarbons and ensure their correct supply ; decisions which <unk w="can"/> lead as quickly as possible to the development of a <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and plan of specific research-based measures and how to finance and implement them .
As a result of these economic <unk w="and"/> CO2 emissions will be reduced , and the bureaucratic trading of emissions - so good for the traders , but not for the economy - will not be necessary .
Madam President , I am touched by the words ' smart ' and ' intelligent ' , which are <unk w="the"/> much part of this debate , because <unk w="the"/> solutions we try and use in our house to reduce energy consumption are <unk w="not"/> <unk w="to"/> working and they are neither smart nor very intelligent .
I wish it were , as it would <unk w="say"/> that I was in control .
So we do need all of the things that others have <unk w="spoken"/> about : sensors and other technological advancements <unk w="that"/> will make everybody 's life easier in terms <unk w="of"/> achieving our energy efficiency objectives .
<unk w="today"/> 's debate <unk w="is"/> a massive one : it is about our climate change agenda , security of supply , solidarity between Member States and also economic growth - and that is an issue for us at the moment - and how we can achieve a better use of our energy resources .
Ireland 's dependency is extremely high : 91 % <unk w="of"/> our needs are imported .
That is quite a staggering <unk w="one"/> , and while <unk w="we"/> have not experienced the gas problems that other colleagues have spoken about , or the cold <unk w="of"/> the horror <unk w="and"/> caused for other Member States , we did <unk w="not"/> , from watching that , how critical it is that we do something about our energy mix and our energy insecurity .
But this <unk w="is"/> a key issue : getting the balance right between food production and fuel production .
The European Union 's dependence <unk w="on"/> oil imports indirectly increases our <unk w="influence"/> on politically unstable countries or those which as <unk w="the"/> energy partners <unk w="and"/> major geostrategic tensions , as we have seen recently with Russia .
For these reasons , it is strategically important to redirect the demand for alternative energy sources to oil , but it is also geographically important to look more carefully at the South American <unk w="north"/> African markets , which are currently expanding and to which the development of the European Union-Brazil and European Union-Africa partnerships could contribute greatly .
Only through the adoption of a global and coordinated <unk w="framework"/> between Community policies and national policies , namely in the areas of cohesion , agriculture and transport , will we be able to outline a strategy that conveys a long-term vision .
The link between energy and territorial cohesion is indisputable in that it affects possible long-term <unk w="support"/> for all the regions of the European Union , including the most isolated and outermost regions .
We are hardly in a position yet to say how much European countries and <unk w="is"/> lost from the gas <unk w="sector"/> .
The direct losses <unk w="of"/> the Bulgarian economy <unk w="itself"/> , which was <unk w="not"/> severely affected by the dispute between Ukraine and Russia , amount to over EUR 230 million , without any compensation .
<unk w="however"/> , the big issue of energy dependence comes to a <unk w="time"/> whenever a political crisis and political antagonism between Russia and Ukraine occur .
Then we had a pledge of a common European energy policy , but three years <unk w=","/> it seems like nothing has changed .
<unk w="have"/> we done enough to interconnect the European gas supply networks among Member States or are we becoming less and less inclined to set aside reserves for crisis situations ?
How are we working on Nord and <unk w="a"/> Stream , and on Nabucco ?
It is not coincidental that at the height of the crisis the Bulgarian Parliament asked its European partners to revive the debate on <unk w="combating"/> the closed reactors at Kozloduy , which have <unk w="been"/> proved safe by the competent <unk w="authority"/> .
Only a few days ago , when the European Commission allocated resources from <unk w="the"/> European Development Plan , the country which was worst affected received the least amount of resources .
This evening I have not heard any mention from you about Bulgaria <unk w=":"/> in the list of 100 % -dependent countries in need of special assistance .
I would find them difficult <unk w="to"/> explain to Bulgarian and to European citizens .
As a member of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection , I have worked a great deal on protecting energy supplies for consumers , but please <unk w="not"/> , it is more important to secure the energy in the first place .
( RO ) I want <unk w="to"/> stress the European Union 's need for an external energy policy so that the <unk w="individual"/> Member States can speak with a single voice during negotiations with major producers .
Diversification of energy supply sources must be one of <unk w="the"/> European Union 's major goals .
Furthermore , the huge costs involved in building this gas pipeline would end up increasing <unk w="the"/> price of gas , a price which European consumers would be obliged to pay .
This is why , in my view , the European Union needs to urgently take action to include in future agreements with Russia and Ukraine some comprehensive clauses <unk w="and"/> energy interdependency , which will set out clear obligations and effective mechanisms for rapidly resolving any problems .
We see the need for a common EU energy policy in the light of the recent developments regarding gas supplies in central and <unk w="eastern"/> Europe but , whilst it is one <unk w="of"/> the key innovations of the Lisbon Treaty , I regret to point out that this point was not highlighted sufficiently in the debates surrounding the Treaty 's ratification .
In <unk w="fact"/> we have 12 days of gas supply at any one time .
The inclusion by the Commission of the electricity interconnection between Ireland and the UK as a priority area for funding under the European economic recovery package is a <unk w="most"/> welcome development in this regard .
It <unk w="therefore"/> emphasises that <unk w="in"/> all 27 <unk w="member"/> States work together we can bring about the change that is required to ensure security of energy <unk w="policy"/> .
Madam President , the two important documents we are discussing today - the Commission 's plan of action and the report on it - are separated in time by the recent interruption of <unk w="projects"/> due to the usual winter quarrel <unk w="in"/> Russia and Ukraine .
Consequently , the report is more attuned to reality , trying to increase our internal solidarity and expedite the implementation of the plan in front <unk w="of"/> us , thus capitalising on the lessons of the last crisis .
Personally , apart from support for the diversification of transport routes for the import of gas , I consider the appeal to expedite <unk w="the"/> achievement of internal market energy in the current legislature and the necessity to revisit the entire problem of gas storage as major contributions of the <unk w="commission"/> .
However , the <unk w="need"/> to fully open the Nabucco <unk w="approach"/> to Russia is questionable since everyone knows that Nabucco <unk w="is"/> conceived as an alternative to Russian gas and that , consequently , Russia <unk w="is"/> already doing everything <unk w="possible"/> to <unk w="do"/> it .
( SK ) Ladies and gentlemen , the recent gas crisis has shown <unk w="the"/> <unk w="lack"/> of a common EU energy policy .
In <unk w="fact"/> , Slovakia has found out what 100 % dependence on Russian gas means .
Hundreds of companies <unk w="have"/> to cease production and pay their employees just 60 % of their wages .
If we had <unk w="not"/> received an emergency transfer <unk w="of"/> gas from Germany through the Czech Republic to Slovakia , households would also have been at risk .
I am convinced that the need to ensure a constant supply <unk w="of"/> energy is a fundamental universal priority .
Meeting the need predominantly from non-renewable sources of <unk w="energy"/> is beginning to outweigh environmental acceptability .
In Europe we are not in a bad situation as far as location is <unk w="concerned"/> .
We <unk w="are"/> almost surrounded by <unk w="imports"/> of gas : North Africa , the Near <unk w="future"/> , Central Asia and Russia .
I would like to point out that in the United States <unk w="we"/> do have a unified market , and the price there for 1 000 cubic metres <unk w="of"/> gas is below USD 200 .
<unk w="it"/> is high time that we gave this the right priority and engaged our financial means so that it finally materialises .
<unk w="we"/> <unk w="are"/> also considering , within the southern corridor , the White Stream ( Caspian-Georgia-Black Sea-Ukraine-Romania ) project ?
Secondly , in the <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> Gas Directive , would you consider a mandatory 90 days of reserves for gas storage for <unk w="all"/> the Member States ?
Do you foresee any obstacles <unk w="to"/> that in the <unk w="future"/> ?
Because it has still to be accepted in the Council : I have heard about four Member States <unk w="""/> .
( RO ) The <unk w="current"/> crisis which we recently faced was <unk w="in"/> Ukraine and Russia , but unfortunately it affected some of the European Union <unk w="member"/> States .
As a result , I feel that developing partnerships with Russia is beneficial to the whole of the European Union , but at the same time , I believe that the European Union must immediately initiate projects which can allow alternative solutions <unk w="to"/> be found , with the precise aim of averting the consequences of crises which could occur <unk w="again"/> in the near or more distant future .
In this case , I am <unk w="referring"/> to the fields in the North Sea and those which are supposed to be on the Black Sea continental shelf .
Given that , over time , all kinds of deposits are going to run out , I believe that we need to invest in scientific projects capable of discovering alternative <unk w="forms"/> of energy , thereby also guaranteeing <unk w="the"/> development of future generations .
( <unk w="fr"/> ) The recent gas <unk w="facility"/> refocuses attention even more sharply on the importance of developing <unk w="transport"/> routes and sources of energy by developing transport infrastructures and establishing interconnections .
In the current climate , the Nabucco project needs to be speeded up as <unk w="it"/> has the potential to help achieve the <unk w="european"/> Union 's objectives of diversifying not only routes , but especially supply sources from third countries .
Transit routes <unk w="to"/> neighbouring countries must be encouraged by completing the projects which involve connecting the network in Romania with those in Hungary and Bulgaria .
At the same <unk w="time"/> , I feel that the South Stream project <unk w="should"/> be regarded as <unk w="having"/> <unk w="for"/> any benefit to Europe , precisely due to the fact that it does not use an alternative source , as requested <unk w="by"/> the report 's strategic review .
One micro-hydroelectric <unk w="which"/> is not viable or effective , but hundreds of thousands of hydroelectric plants from the Alps right to the <unk w="country"/> or from the Balkans <unk w="or"/> to the Tatras or Pyrenees mean energy independence .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , this has been a really fascinating debate <unk w="and"/> has reflected all the diversity of views on energy and the importance that this issue deserves .
Again I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for really going through the process of ensuring that all opinions are reflected in the report , while at the same time clearly supporting <unk w="the"/> Commission 's second strategic energy review .
Supergrid is <unk w="a"/> tool that was seen as a magical solution .
Well , it is true that it has a <unk w="number"/> of potential , but with a grid we have a challenge .
<unk w="it"/> needs to pay for the grid , and , as you know , we are looking for a balance between <unk w="freedom"/> , security of supply and sustainability .
<unk w="however"/> , if we really want to move towards this supergrid , the recovery plan is the first small step in the right direction .
The recovery plan can lead to a vicious circle where we say : ' Well , we need this , we need that , but it should <unk w="be"/> done by industry ' .
On the third internal market <unk w="afternoon"/> , I would just say what it does for Europe .
<unk w="these"/> two issues are crucially related to security of supply , while at the same time not taking away national sovereignty over energy .
So if <unk w="this"/> package is adopted now , we will achieve a lot of momentum .
If it is postponed , we will lose a lot of momentum <unk w="and"/> security of supply .
So , in my opinion , the recovery plan and the third <unk w="millennium"/> package is something that needs to <unk w="be"/> done .
One is whether <unk w="we"/> should give public funds to energy at all .
The second issue is ' a <unk w="good"/> return for my country ' .
Well , I could <unk w="point"/> out that my country is not specifically covered by this recovery plan , so it is good that there <unk w="is"/> a lot of <unk w="emphasis"/> on this .
I explained that any <unk w="agreement"/> with the Baltic as a whole helps my country as well .
So this <unk w="proposal"/> <unk w="has"/> still looked at very much from a national perspective : ' my fair return ' .
I believe we are here taking the first <unk w="step"/> towards European public funds supporting <unk w="this"/> type of development .
This could be the biggest difficulty , but I believe the Council will <unk w="find"/> hard <unk w="not"/> to approve of our proposal because I believe it is balanced , if <unk w="not"/> ideal for every Member State .
We are working now , we have <unk w="at"/> the intergovernmental conference with a view to concluding <unk w="matters"/> in March with an intergovernmental agreement and a project support agreement .
As for gas storage , we <unk w="are"/> considering this , but 90 days should not be necessary for everyone , because it very much depends on imports .
So we are still looking at what the fine-tuning of the gas <unk w="electricity"/> proposal could look like .
Again I would like to thank <unk w="you"/> for this debate .
It was a very tough debate , <unk w="and"/> I believe <unk w="that"/> all elements are there and we just need to continue to work very vigorously to implement the ones that we have agreed on and the proposals that have been agreed in this House .
Again I would like to thank Parliament <unk w="for"/> its strong support for developing a <unk w="common"/> energy policy .
<unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of the Commission . - Mr President , we <unk w="have"/> had a very fascinating debate .
I agree that much , if not the majority , of the <unk w="committee"/> falls to our colleague who is responsible for energy .
However , everything that you have been calling for - energy security , more efficiency , intelligent networks , decentralised networks , the supergrid , the micro <unk w="union"/> , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> power plants - needs ICT to be run .
<unk w="but"/> it is essential that we make every effort to get this intelligent means , in order to put into practice the policy proposed by the committee on energy efficiency .
If we get the ICT to allow energy efficiency to go in the right direction , then we are creating many industries , a lot of growth <unk w="in"/> many jobs .
That <unk w="is"/> also the reason why we have to go ahead with smart building , smart lighting and smart transport .
Only if we apply , in practical terms , the possibilities shown to us by research , will we not only be less dependent because we will be more efficient , but we will also build a <unk w="large"/> industrial capacity .
As you know , we will <unk w="be"/> adopting the high-efficiency light-emitting diodes - the famous LEDs - which , already today , will cut 30 % of energy consumption in lighting and up to 50 % by 2025 .
We have already , <unk w="according"/> to European research , gone one step forward .
In 2007 , due to our European Framework Programme on Research , we <unk w="support"/> the OLEDs - the organic LEDs - with a supplementary efficiency of 50 % on the LEDs .
European research has brought <unk w="the"/> results and it is now both national and regional policy to put these results into practice .
Well , if I am reading <unk w="this"/> plan correctly , I see that EUR 1 billion is allocated to energy efficiency <unk w="and"/> buildings .
EUR 5 billion goes to clean <unk w="up"/> , so that cars will no longer be dependent on petrol as they are today , and there is EUR 1 billion for smart manufacturing <unk w="in"/> order to use less time <unk w="and"/> less energy in our industries .
We are <unk w="not"/> <unk w="the"/> right path and I think that , with the help of Parliament and with a lot of pushing in the national Member <unk w="states"/> , we will manage not only to secure these means but also to apply them in practice .
<unk w="renewable"/> energy efficiency <unk w="will"/> not only be about speeches but also about facts .
rapporteur . - ( FR ) Mr President , Mrs Reding , <unk w="mr"/> Piebalgs , ladies and gentlemen , thank you for your exceptionally valuable contributions ; they show how vast this energy field is and that energy really is a basic need .
In our debate and in the report , which moreover reflect <unk w="the"/> discussions <unk w=","/> we have had among ourselves in the various political groups , I have noted a broad consensus on the need to strengthen the networks and the interconnections , to use information and communication technologies to make the networks intelligent - as Mrs Reding just explained - to strengthen relations with producer <unk w="countries"/> and transit countries - that was in particular the aim of the Committee on Foreign <unk w="affairs"/> , with our rapporteur , Mr Dimitrakopoulos - and also to reach an agreement on energy efficiency , energy savings , and the development of renewable energies .
In conclusion , improving energy efficiency , developing renewable energies , diversifying our sources and lines of <unk w="view"/> , consolidating the dialogue with producer countries , but also ensuring that the 27 Member States <unk w="speak"/> with one voice and , above all , that we effect a change in our lives is the consensus that we have achieved .
The differences of course relate to the composition of the energy <unk w="sector"/> .
I <unk w="believe"/> <unk w="that"/> we <unk w="have"/> set some very ambitious targets for 2050 .
Mention has been <unk w="more"/> of an 80 % reduction in CO2 <unk w="emissions"/> and of a 60 % share of renewable energies .
In terms of <unk w="renewable"/> energy , it is acknowledged in this report that it is part of the energy mix .
In this regard , I should like <unk w="to"/> conclude by simply reminding you of the objectives : a CO2 concentration of 450 ppm , which has been <unk w="adopted"/> in order to guarantee this limit of a 2 ° C rise .
I should like to remind you that , in these efforts that have been announced , we are talking about a 9 % share <unk w="of"/> nuclear energy , 54 % energy efficiency , 35 % renewables <unk w="by"/> 14 % geological carbon capture and storage .
I for my part am not a fan of coal , I am not a fan of nuclear , but we need to have the <unk w="greatest"/> possible range of energy sources .
In accordance with Rule 108 ( 5 ) of <unk w="the"/> Rules of Procedure , I have received one motion for a resolution at the end of the <unk w="debate"/> on the oral question by Mr Remek .
Indeed , the strategies adopted by each Member State <unk w="at"/> national level must not <unk w="support"/> the energy interests of other Member States and <unk w="must"/> be in the European Union 's general interest in terms of energy security .
In this context , the task of improving the Community legislative framework aimed at energy interdependency within the EU and drafting a new generation of <unk w="legal"/> acts intended to govern the European Union 's relations both with energy suppliers outside the EU <unk w="and"/> the transit states must act as an effective instrument in the process of drawing up a European security policy .
The new laws will have to provide <unk w="the"/> legal constraint mechanisms intended to consolidate cooperation in the energy sector and develop viable competition <unk w="in"/> the European energy markets .
It is essential to encourage the efforts aimed at increasing EU investments with regard to diversification of cross-border structures , incentives for generating alternative , non-conventional forms of energy at local <unk w="level"/> and improvements in the infrastructure 's ability to facilitate connection to new energy sources .
The European Union must also seriously <unk w="participate"/> in the need to stimulate the private energy sector in Member States , which is already feeling <unk w="the"/> consequences of the global economic crisis .
It could be said <unk w="that"/> the January energy crisis is slowly starting to turn into an <unk w="individual"/> ritual .
The more severe the winter the greater the certainty that the Russian <unk w="authorities"/> will turn off the gas supply <unk w="of"/> European countries .
It is therefore all the more surprising , in the face of another gas conflict whose victims <unk w="are"/> citizens of European Union countries , that Chancellor Angela Merkel is still pushing the proposal of building the Nord Stream gas pipeline with Community funds .
What the European Commission should be doing now is preparing a plan for diversification <unk w="and"/> energy sources .
It should also be a priority to create gas interconnectors enabling connections between systems and rapid transmission of gas reserves in <unk w="the"/> event of further crises .
However , our trade agreements should be based on the special ' energy security clause ' , <unk w="it"/> would be the business ethics of the sector .
For Europe and the rest of the world , which conduct business in a civilised <unk w="world"/> , it is important that the <unk w="russian"/> Federation ratifies the Energy Charter Treaty .
I think that only the cohesive and <unk w="realistic"/> position of a <unk w="fortress"/> Europe will be able to persuade the Kremlin to make such a decision .
The gas <unk w="protocol"/> which the EU was confronted with in January <unk w="is"/> not the first in the history of the EU .
The missing energy link must be created , and <unk w="we"/> must also strengthen the Directive on the security <unk w="of"/> gas supply and establish an EU coordinating mechanism designed to react to similar crises .
The crisis between Russia and Ukraine is not just a crisis <unk w="of"/> mutual trust , but a geopolitical crisis too .
Both countries must take responsibility for the <unk w="fact"/> that Member States did not receive gas .
Europe must act decisively , as the solution of this energy crisis over the supply <unk w="of"/> <unk w="aid"/> from Russia is only <unk w="possible"/> .
I would like to thank Mrs Laperrouze for this report and say that I support the <unk w="conclusions"/> of its conclusions .
The EU must <unk w="be"/> ambitious in the battle against climate change , which means that the role of nuclear power <unk w="from"/> renewable energy sources cannot be discounted .
I therefore welcome the <unk w="european"/> Commission 's proposal to allocate EUR 1.5 billion to interconnection projects .
In <unk w="addition"/> , the criteria established in Barcelona for <unk w="peace"/> must be met by all Member States .
In Romania , for example , there is huge potential for making savings and I would like <unk w="the"/> opportunity to be utilised .
The Russia-Ukraine crisis has highlighted once again <unk w="the"/> need for a common EU approach .
I support the report 's conclusion , including <unk w="the"/> point about signing an agreement between the EU , Russia and Ukraine .
However , I do not agree with the statement about the South Stream project being a vital project for the EU <unk w="'s"/> energy security to the same degree as Nabucco .
South Stream is a rival project to Nabucco <unk w="or"/> does not meet at all the needs to diversify energy supply sources in order to guarantee the EU 's energy security .
In the first few weeks of 2009 , EU Member States were treated <unk w="as"/> hostages <unk w="in"/> Ukraine , whose leaders initiated a supply <unk w="of"/> <unk w="agreement"/> with Moscow over <unk w="the"/> price of <unk w="the"/> deliveries .
Kiev based its action on the hope that , as a result of the traditional anti-Russian sentiment in Western and Eastern Europe , it would be <unk w="possible"/> to gain the support of most EU Member States .
Just one part of this is the energy <unk w="sector"/> according to which we need to put up with the Russians , or they will turn off the gas tap .
The lack of a common energy <unk w="on"/> foreign policy , squeezing the diversification of energy use into <unk w="the"/> background and prioritising certain historical injuries and commercial advantages renders our Union vulnerable .
A united EU would give Moscow pause <unk w="for"/> thought , for it has <unk w="been"/> before seen such a thing .
In the face of countries engaging in capricious politics , however , an enormous <unk w="issue"/> like Russia can easily assert its will .
The Strategic Energy Review provides a good summary of all the steps that are indispensable for the European Union to reduce its dependence on external energy <unk w="policy"/> .
In addition to imposing obligatory minimum stocks , it is important , in our view , to strengthen <unk w="the"/> mechanisms of solidarity with Community regulations , in harmony with the Lisbon Treaty .
<unk w="it"/> is commendable that <unk w="the"/> energy review carried out by the Commission names the infrastructures whose creation would be in the <unk w="public"/> interest of all Member States .
The significance of the <unk w="directive"/> that was initially linked to MOL <unk w=","/> in the <unk w="way"/> that the states involved will find it easier to assist one another <unk w=","/> in the event <unk w="of"/> <unk w="access"/> to supply .
We consider the European Commission <unk w="'s"/> decision to redirect a portion of unused EU funds to energy infrastructures a good one .
What is less positive , however , is that the most vulnerable <unk w="member"/> States are to receive a smaller portion of the financing for their infrastructure <unk w="that"/> they had wished .
However , the emphatic commitments can only be honoured by a more spectacular financial contribution and solidarity on <unk w="the"/> part of Community .
The unpleasant experience of the Russo-Ukrainian gas conflict in January <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> was necessary for the question of energy security to become a matter of primary importance for the entire European Community .
We cannot hide behind the fact that the Treaty <unk w="of"/> Lisbon , which does include statements about energy solidarity , has <unk w="not"/> been ratified .
All <unk w="this"/> is needed is the political will , supported by a cold analysis of the last crisis , in order to <unk w="clarify"/> future scenarios and to deliver <unk w="the"/> <unk w="european"/> Union from problems <unk w="arising"/> to those which were caused by the gas supply blockade via Ukraine .
Both the Commission <unk w="proposal"/> and the Laperrouze report draw attention to ways of coping with emergency situations , such as increasing reserves and creating a transmission network which will ensure technical availability .
It will be more difficult to agree a long-term strategy , which will have to include a realistic position on Russia , because it is - currently - the <unk w="current"/> supplier of crude oil and gas <unk w="in"/> Europe .
Mutual dependence , as we have learned , does not guarantee continuity of supply and relations based on <unk w="the"/> economic premises .
The most difficult thing in relations with our eastern neighbours will be to root out the tendency <unk w="to"/> make bilateral agreements , and that is the real measure of <unk w="success"/> or failure of Community energy security and energy solidarity policy !
Like the rapporteur , I think it is very important for the Union in its energy strategy to commit <unk w="a"/> common , long-term <unk w="orientation"/> .
To guarantee <unk w="social"/> security in Europe , <unk w="the"/> Union needs to invest in the establishment <unk w="of"/> a common main grid and a common energy market , and better coordination .
The report is not ambitious enough <unk w="as"/> regards renewable energy sources .
A competitive Europe built on sustainable use must aim to increase the renewable energy <unk w="markets"/> to 80 % by the year 2050 .
Many studies , including the German Aerospace Centre and <unk w="the"/> Heinrich-Böll-Stiftung ERENE studies , show that the effective introduction of new and clean forms of energy would be <unk w="environmentally"/> and economically possible .
Mrs Laperrouze 's report refers to an issue that is particularly important <unk w="for"/> every European citizen , especially during the gas crisis which we faced recently .
We all need to make our contribution <unk w="to"/> successfully attaining the ambitious <unk w="objectives"/> which this Second <unk w="nuclear"/> Energy Review is proposing , namely energy supply sustainability , competitiveness and security .
I <unk w="wish"/> to emphasise the importance of improving the security of our energy resources .
We need to support investments in infrastructure and in new technologies with <unk w="the"/> <unk w="energy"/> consumption , so that we can successfully achieve the ' 20-20-20 ' objectives .
At the same time , this new strategy needs to lay the foundations for economic <unk w="growth"/> in the EU .
I would like to remind you of the geopolitical importance of Romania and the Black Sea <unk w=","/> for energy security and diversification of energy supply resources .
- The next item <unk w="is"/> a short presentation of the <unk w="report"/> by Mr Schröder , on behalf of the Committee on Development , on the development impact of Economic Partnership Agreements ( EPAs ) .
' Economic partnership agreements ' really is quite a <unk w="disproportionate"/> , particularly in German .
The Cotonou Agreement <unk w="stipulates"/> that economic partnership agreements should be concluded between the European Union and the ACP ( African , Caribbean Pacific ) States by the end of 2007 .
We have now managed to set up , at <unk w="least"/> in part of the Caribbean , an economic partnership agreement of this type , which we hope <unk w="will"/> be a success .
My report states that this agreement will form a <unk w="legal"/> basis for development cooperation : we are helping them to help themselves .
There has , of course , been a certain <unk w="amount"/> of friction , in particular here in Parliament <unk w="in"/> our committee , the Committee on Regional Development , and the Committee on International Trade , relating primarily to the compatibility of this agreement with the rules of the WTO and especially the issue of parliamentary scrutiny .
It sets out both the opportunities and the risks of the economic partnership agreements , but it particularly emphasises the potential positive effects of <unk w="these"/> agreements on the people in those countries .
Before I finish , Mr <unk w="president"/> , I would just like to say one more thing : some of our fellow Members have repeatedly claimed that people in the ACP States had too little time to conclude these agreements .
That <unk w="is"/> not true : they had from 2000 to 2007 ; then they had another year until 2008 ; and we still have time .
We are not , however , saying to people in these <unk w="matters"/> that they can do it whenever they like : time is running out .
It is in the interests <unk w="of"/> the people in the ACP States , and I therefore call on all Members of this House to vote in favour of my report on Thursday , including those who originally intended to <unk w="vote"/> against it .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , the Commission welcomes the report by Mr Schroeder , which represents a balanced overview of the diversity of opinions surrounding the development impact of the Economic <unk w="fisheries"/> Agreements ( EPAs ) .
We have signed a full Economic Partnership Agreement with <unk w="the"/> Caribbean region , whilst we have negotiated interim agreements with countries and regions in Africa and the Pacific .
These interim EPAs provide for a trade regime compatible with WTO <unk w="rules"/> and preserve important trade preferences for these countries .
The interim agreements are only transitory in nature , as they will be replaced by full <unk w="market"/> EPAs .
The pace of <unk w="these"/> negotiations will be set by <unk w="the"/> regions concerned to ensure those objectives and coverage match their own <unk w="budget"/> processes , capacity , needs and political priorities .
In parallel , the programming of the 10th European Development Fund has moved <unk w="forward"/> .
In anticipation of the EPAs , these programmes include considerable support to help our African , Caribbean and Pacific ( ACP ) partners make the most <unk w="of"/> the agreements : direct support for the implementation of the agreements and indirect support to build up infrastructure and productive capacity .
At the same time we welcome the fact that <unk w="the"/> report acknowledges that the development objectives <unk w="are"/> outcomes of the agreements are a much wider issue than just financial support .
We also <unk w="consider"/> the essential role of reform in the ACP <unk w="countries"/> in reaching the development objectives , as set out in paragraph 14 <unk w="of"/> the report .
The reforms offset <unk w="borne"/> in the tax base due to liberalisation and are in <unk w="fact"/> valuable steps to ensuring sustainable public financing in the <unk w="future"/> .
The interim agreements do not yet include <unk w="candidate"/> ACP countries .
This is exactly why these agreements are only temporary <unk w="and"/> full agreement .
This is why the EPAs contain all sorts of flexibilities , and in particular exclusions and asymmetrical <unk w="need"/> for the ACP side , as called for in the report .
On the EU side , our markets are completely open <unk w="to"/> ACP products , with increased cooperation to meet technical and health standards and facilitate trade .
ACP countries will only open their markets <unk w="efficiently"/> , with <unk w="the"/> possibility to maintain exceptions .
The Commission does not see our commitment to the <unk w="peace"/> process ending on signature .
This is the start of a process of enhanced dialogue , careful implementation , monitoring , and evaluation of the effect , especially as regards the <unk w="environmental"/> impact .
All of this will use the institutions established to implement <unk w="an"/> agreement to ensure transparency and the participation of parliamentarians and civil society .
The Commission therefore welcomes <unk w="the"/> report by Mr Schröder and will provide a detailed reaction to the <unk w="issues"/> raised in due <unk w="course"/> .
in writing . - ( FR ) On Thursday Parliament will give its <unk w="opinion"/> on Mr Schröder <unk w="'s"/> report on Economic Partnership Agreements ( EPAs ) .
The Socialist Group in the <unk w="european"/> Parliament will not vote in favour of this text , since it in no way reflects the <unk w="interests"/> both of Europeans and of our ACP partners about the EPAs and the way in which they are negotiated .
In contrast to the rapporteur 's <unk w="vote"/> , the PSE Group has <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and will vote in favour of a motion for a resolution which puts development back at the heart of the EPAs ' priorities , which rejects the liberalisation of public services and any negotiation on the Singapore issues or on services against the ACP States ' wishes , which promotes regional integration , which calls for huge financial support to bring the ACP States ' economies up to standard , and <unk w="it"/> takes account of the specific characteristics and fragilities of these countries , be they least developed countries or otherwise .
These <unk w="are"/> the conditions that would make the EPAs acceptable agreements .
- The next item is a short presentation of the report by Mr Hegyi , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food <unk w="safety"/> , on wilderness in Europe .
We must do everything we can to ensure that at least the remaining wilderness , this 1 % , is preserved for the sake of future <unk w="cooperation"/> .
There is a dual perception of <unk w="interference"/> in European culture .
On the one hand , it is viewed as a place to fear and avoid , where monsters and unknown dangers lie in wait for us , as <unk w="a"/> evoked in many folk tales .
On the other hand , it is seen as an <unk w="important"/> , pleasant place that gives us temporary refuge from the stress of urban and industrial civilisation .
English-language <unk w="report"/> on the topic makes a distinction between the concept of conservation , that is , the proper use of nature , and of preservation , in other words the protection of nature from all human use .
The territory of Europe is <unk w="relatively"/> small to have zones that are off-limits to its <unk w="effects"/> .
Discovering nature and encountering conditions <unk w="pursued"/> by humanity before civilisation teaches respect for nature and can serve as the basis for high-quality tourism .
At the same time , these areas are extremely vulnerable to environmental changes caused by human beings - for instance as a result of motorisation , chemicals and climate <unk w="change"/> - and to the appearance of alien plant and animal species .
We need to be careful that visitors do not endanger the wilderness , and therefore all forms of tourism should be placed <unk w="on"/> the oversight of conservation experts .
The development of <unk w="european"/> tourism should be combined with the protection of these areas , and all proceeds should be devoted to wilderness protection .
The wilderness is a refuge for many <unk w="people"/> , such as the brown bear , the wolf and the lynx , which are unable to survive under even slightly altered conditions .
These <unk w="two"/> areas are well-suited to the study of <unk w="globalisation"/> , of natural changes occurring in nature .
Wilderness zones are generally part <unk w="of"/> the Natura 2000 network , <unk w="because"/> they require stricter protection .
My report <unk w="therefore"/> calls upon the European Commission <unk w="to"/> work with the Member States <unk w="and"/> map the remaining wilderness regions in Europe and develop a strategy for their increased protection .
The natural values of the still-untouched areas and <unk w="the"/> characteristics of the habitats should be determined , and their further protection should be ensured .
<unk w="you"/> have advised me that we should not think in <unk w="terms"/> of new legislation , but rather introduce more specific and stricter protection for wilderness zones within the Natura 2000 regulations .
Since the financing of Natura 2000 is at any rate contradictory , and the source of much legitimate criticism , we will in any case have to make changes to the relevant <unk w="legislation"/> in the next parliamentary cycle but at the latest in the new budget .
I would be very happy if Hungarian and Slovak conservationists <unk w="would"/> successfully collaborate to develop a Protected <unk w="european"/> Network ( PAN ) Park , since the network of PAN Parks has developed a successful European-wide system of wilderness protection .
It is quite literally a <unk w="word"/> about the future of life on Earth .
But , despite the fundamental importance <unk w="of"/> preserving biodiversity , progress to date has been limited .
Despite the positive developments that have been made in recent years - for instance the Natura 2000 network - the EU 's biodiversity is <unk w="due"/> under continuous pressure due to habitat destruction , pollution , climate change and the impact of invasive species .
The Commission 's conclusion was that we are highly unlikely to meet our 2010 <unk w="objectives"/> of halting biodiversity decline - and that further intensive efforts will be required , both at Member State and EU levels .
We greatly welcome the initiative <unk w="of"/> Mr Hegyi for producing this important resolution on wilderness in Europe .
I would like to start by making the general observation that many of the issues highlighted <unk w="in"/> the report are already being followed up by the Commission .
For example , in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> , the Commission adopted a <unk w="declaration"/> , ' Towards an EU Strategy on Invasive <unk w="country"/> ' .
We are also launching an overall reflection on the future of EU biodiversity policy and look forward <unk w="to"/> the input of the European Parliament on these questions .
Issues such as improving implementation and the relationship between biodiversity and <unk w="climate"/> change must be explicitly considered .
There is an ongoing assessment of the effectiveness of our nature legislation - the so-called Article 17 <unk w="treaty"/> - but there are currently no plans to amend our legislation , and the main focus is on more effective implementation .
Turning to the subject of wilderness , Europe is densely populated and only <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> % of the territory has not been affected by human intervention .
But while these wilderness areas are small in area , they are of high value <unk w="for"/> both scientific and cultural terms .
They can even , as is the case in the common trans-border <unk w="and"/> Park of the German Bavarian and Czech Bohemian forests , be a symbol for European cooperation and integration .
Most of these areas are already a part of the <unk w="natura"/> 2000 network .
However , this report provides the inspiration to look again at the wild and nearly wild areas in the EU and to see if there are instances where additional European actions can <unk w="help"/> protect these <unk w="new"/> places .
This Conference will <unk w="take"/> a platform <unk w="to"/> consider the issues related to wilderness areas in Europe and identify measures needed to ensure their conservation .
The concept of a <unk w="european"/> landscape that <unk w="is"/> the needs of nature with the needs <unk w="of"/> man is the basis of the thinking that underpins Natura 2000 .
We certainly do not intend to re-convert our existing landscapes into wild nature , but we need to publicly commit ourselves to preserving the last <unk w="few"/> wild areas of Europe .
It represents a very welcome input into the <unk w="intergovernmental"/> conference .
Mr President , on a point <unk w="of"/> order , I <unk w="would"/> like to protest <unk w="at"/> the overuse <unk w="of"/> the increasingly liberal use of Rule 45 ( 2 ) under which these most important debates are <unk w="concerned"/> .
I rise at this point because I <unk w="too"/> would have liked to have spoken on the excellent work of Mr Hegyi 's report and indeed I have colleagues coming on on subjects which are not discussed in my main committee and other colleagues ' main committees , and I am being denied the right <unk w="to"/> contribute toward them in plenary .
In the PPE-DE Group we had a <unk w="very"/> vexed and heated argument both at <unk w="the"/> group and group level last week on the number of Rule 45 ( 2 ) items on our <unk w="agenda"/> this week .
I know it is a rule that was set by Parliament and the Members themselves signed off on , but our good will , I feel , <unk w="be"/> being abused by the number of points on our agenda - the most important points on our agenda - that we <unk w="are"/> being increasingly disallowed to debate .
- Mrs Doyle , we will obviously gladly take note of your statement , but I would remind you that the use of Rule 45 is in the hands of the Conference of Presidents and that , within the latter , votes are weighted , that is to say that the large groups , and your own in particular , have a huge amount of power to decide <unk w="exactly"/> what should be allowed in plenary under such-and-such a rule .
I <unk w="am"/> a bit like you ; I must say that we have perhaps gone from a phase of being <unk w="completely"/> tolerant to one of being too strict and that the truth is definitely somewhere in between .
<unk w="i"/> should also refer to your group chairmen , ladies and gentlemen .
Of course , this cannot be <unk w="done"/> without defining ' wilderness ' , therefore I urge the European Commission to take action in this field .
Secondly , I wish <unk w="to"/> speak on the key issue of this report , namely human presence and tourism .
Therefore I join the request of the main NGOs in the field and <unk w="by"/> the European Commission to give some guidelines for wilderness preservation in Europe .
But the increase in demand for wilderness tourism puts pressure on the very same values that the tourists are seeking <unk w="and"/> can speed up the destruction of fragile ecosystems .
Tourism activities <unk w="must"/> be allowed under strict conditions , such as a limited number of tourists per day , and on the basis of a solid sustainable tourism plan that supports conservation initiatives and <unk w="as"/> a responsible experience of wilderness .
The tourism plans and the activities of <unk w="social"/> operators should be evaluated by means of thorough assessment mechanisms , especially designed for wilderness areas .
The aim is to make tourists and operators aware that wilderness entails not <unk w="only"/> freedom but also <unk w="democracy"/> .
In this respect , Romania is one of the countries which possess a significant amount and variety <unk w="of"/> flora and fauna .
To achieve this goal , however , the Europe Union must extend the use of Community funds earmarked <unk w="for"/> financing wilderness conservation activities .
Consequently , the <unk w="eu"/> should allocate larger sums through the Fund for Rural Development to environmental protection projects in the European agricultural sector , with a clear aim of financing wilderness conservation activities .
On the other <unk w="hand"/> , the European Commission <unk w="will"/> introduce a set of clear rules <unk w="for"/> providing financial support to local community projects in the vicinity of these areas , which <unk w="are"/> controlled forms of tourism in the areas intended for conservation and generate economic benefits which can be enjoyed by the relevant local communities .
In addition , the Commission <unk w="must"/> encourage cross-border cooperation between Member States for conservation projects targeting wilderness areas situated in the territory of two or more countries .
Europe 's biodiversity is the most precious legacy which <unk w="we"/> can leave future generations .
I welcome and <unk w="support"/> this report <unk w="on"/> Europe <unk w="in"/> wilderness areas .
I would like to draw attention to the alarming state of the area <unk w="of"/> the richest biodiversity in Europe , the Danube Delta .
<unk w="one"/> of the biggest sources of aggression affecting the Delta is rooted <unk w="in"/> the lack of awareness of the Delta 's populations and of rural populations living along the Danube 's <unk w="irish"/> flowing through Romania .
I would like to take this opportunity to call on the Commission and the Council , based on this report , to consider <unk w="as"/> soon as possible specific measures aimed at : setting up a working party to examine the situation of the Danube Delta , devising effective educational programmes about the environment targeted at the populations with a direct impact on the area 's biodiversity , and establishing biodiversity protection standards .
At the same time , wilderness conservation in the European Union , especially in the Danube Delta area , cannot be achieved without applying similar measures <unk w="to"/> <unk w="third"/> countries neighbouring the EU .
Therefore , I urge the Commission and the Council to step up their dialogue and the implementation of specific measures as part of their relations with <unk w="the"/> <unk w="countries"/> .
Bearing in mind that it will not be possible to meet the commitments made in 2007 by adopting the resolution on halting the loss <unk w="of"/> biodiversity by 2010 , the protection of wilderness areas through promotion , development and financing activities is becoming a priority in the light of climate change and the negative impact of tourism .
<unk w="the"/> proposal to create a system for mapping Europe 's wilderness would help identify biodiversity and unspoilt areas <unk w="which"/> will <unk w="focus"/> more attention and a significant <unk w="impact"/> on the part of Member States in order to protect them .
<unk w="information"/> campaigns aimed at raising the <unk w="european"/> public 's awareness of wilderness areas , the implementation of high-quality <unk w="product"/> tourism and the enforcement of the Birds and Habitats Directives <unk w=","/> just some of the instruments which will help us protect these areas .
There are already eight national parks in Europe , including Retezat National Park in <unk w="colombia"/> .
These parks are part <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="european"/> Area Network ( PAN ) .
The European Commission should support <unk w="the"/> initiative and cooperate with this network with a view to exchanging information and good practice .
- The next item is a short presentation of the report by Mr Queiró , on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism , <unk w="on"/> an agenda for sustainable future in general and business aviation .
The political significance of this report therefore derives from the <unk w="fact"/> that this is the first time that the Commission and Parliament have examined this activity , at a time <unk w="when"/> it is recording accelerated growth both in volume and in economic importance .
The numbers speak for themselves : in business aviation alone , small and medium-sized enterprises working in <unk w="this"/> field are multiplying , the number of aircraft is <unk w="subject"/> to double to 3 500 in the next decade and annual turnover amounts to more than EUR 25 billion .
Directly or indirectly , it generates <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> 000 jobs across Europe .
Together with general aviation , where it is calculated that there are between 30 000 <unk w="or"/> 50 000 aircraft , the sector <unk w="is"/> around 9 % of all recorded air traffic and <unk w="that"/> the fastest growth in Europe , twice as high as that of all other traffic .
The general aviation sector <unk w="is"/> essential services in very diverse areas , from search-and-rescue aviation <unk w="sector"/> firefighting , traffic regulation , cartography and leisure and sports aviation .
I must also mention European industry <unk w="in"/> this sector , which has been showing continuous growth in its world market share , which currently hovers around 16 % and which it is therefore necessary to support .
Looking at the report itself , I agree , as rapporteur , with the need emphasised by the Commission in its communication to examine <unk w="the"/> specific needs of the sector <unk w="to"/> identify its central <unk w="role"/> .
The former relate to data collection and are based on the necessity <unk w="of"/> providing political decision-makers with sufficient data and statistical information to give them a better understanding of the sector so that they <unk w="can"/> regulate it adequately .
The second point relates to the <unk w="application"/> of the principle of proportionality in regulating the sector .
The key question is whether the rules designed to govern the operation of commercial aircraft will be adequate <unk w="and"/> operating simpler and smaller , often <unk w="by"/> aircraft .
We support the Commission in its intention to apply the principle of proportionality both in drafting the rules and in their implementation , always bearing in mind the necessity of not <unk w="adequate"/> safety in general .
This is <unk w="the"/> case , for example , with the adaptation of certain airworthiness rules , already adopted by the European Aviation Safety Agency ( EASA ) , to operations with non-commercial aircraft , or the possible application of specific rules with regard to simplified security and passenger screening procedures in business <unk w="transactions"/> .
The diagnosis has been made : these aircraft generally have <unk w="invested"/> in accessing <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> and are starting to have the same problems in regional and secondary airports .
The solutions <unk w="resulting"/> from optimising the use of existing capacity to perhaps revising the regulations on slots .
It is also necessary to stimulate investment in small <unk w="and"/> medium-sized airports to provide increasing interconnections between the different European regions and cities .
As regards the question of airspace <unk w="management"/> , we <unk w="appreciate"/> the importance of reforms within the framework of the Single <unk w="european"/> Sky and the SESAR ( Single <unk w="european"/> Sky ATM Research ) Joint Undertaking and , once again , we come back to the need not to impose disproportionate demands on small aircraft in terms of navigation equipment , <unk w="and"/> always complying with <unk w="emission"/> limits .
Although the CO2 emissions of small aircraft are lower , it is still necessary to promote research , <unk w="research"/> and innovation , not only within the framework of the Clean Sky and CESAR ( Cost Effective <unk w="and"/> Aircraft ) initiatives , but also in the use of less polluting engines and cleaner fuels .
That is the <unk w="purpose"/> of the Committee on Transport and Tourism <unk w=","/> it calls on the Commission <unk w="'s"/> report by the end of <unk w="november"/> on the progress achieved on the issues raised in the report .
With tomorrow 's vote , my expectation is that this wish will <unk w="be"/> shared <unk w="by"/> a large majority of the Members of this House .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , the Commission welcomes the report and thanks the rapporteur <unk w="and"/> the committee for their excellent work .
In January 2008 the Commission for the first time published a communication on general <unk w="to"/> business aviation .
<unk w="this"/> was followed by a very positive Council conclusion in April 2008 , and now by this important report of Parliament .
It invests <unk w="investment"/> in research and development , and is growing fast .
General and business aviation mainly comprises small and medium-sized <unk w="enterprises"/> .
The regulations need to be adapted to this specific nature , without , however , compromising safety or <unk w="health"/> .
The Commission <unk w="believes"/> in the coming year to propose a number of EU implementing rules ensuring a <unk w="high"/> level of safety of non-commercial aviation .
As highlighted in your report , we have to make <unk w="sure"/> that they are <unk w="not"/> only providing for an adequate level of safety , <unk w="they"/> are also proportionate and do not impose unnecessary burden on operators .
We will also continue the development <unk w="in"/> the future ATM system for Europe with a clear understanding that airspace is a common good that <unk w="must"/> be accessible for all its users in a safe <unk w="way"/> .
From the perspective of <unk w="european"/> aviation , the Single European Sky and SESAR will be of the utmost importance for enhancing , in a safe way , access to airspace and <unk w="services"/> .
These technologies will open the way to new services , as <unk w="it"/> unseen in Europe .
Here as well , proportionality <unk w="must"/> be an important principle to <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
The Commission is looking forward to working with Parliament along the lines of <unk w="this"/> report , and will report back on the progress made .
At the outset I would like to thank Luís <unk w="parish"/> for his report on a subject so important to the future of transport in Europe .
I <unk w="would"/> like to emphasise the significance of the issue of developing general and business aviation and the aircraft manufacturing industry in this sector .
Although the solutions <unk w="proposed"/> by the Commission do not bring any radical legislative changes and may seem of little significance today , their influence on the future of aviation <unk w="in"/> the light of deregulation of the market and development of the air carriage sector in Poland cannot be overestimated .
The Commission <unk w="'s"/> objective is to facilitate development of this aviation sector by simplifying existing regulatory procedures , adapting provisions to new forms of air traffic management and revising them to ensure proportionality .
It is <unk w="clear"/> that this initiative is worthy of full support .
However , care should be taken that , in the processes of formulating and implementing policy , the needs of all categories of users of airspace and aviation infrastructure are given consideration in the planning and optimisation of <unk w="training"/> .
In order to facilitate further reform a basic European data collection system should , however , be created <unk w="in"/> general and business aviation .
Ultimately it <unk w="is"/> also <unk w="be"/> necessary to facilitate the access of this sector to foreign markets , supporting the development of new , competitive technologies , but at the <unk w="same"/> time taking care that respect is maintained for the principles of <unk w="the"/> environment protection .
in writing . - I welcome this report for <unk w="which"/> seeks to harmonize and <unk w="give"/> more <unk w="access"/> to the rules on General and Business Aviation on a community level .
However , to <unk w="be"/> the most of it , we <unk w="need"/> to establish the proper regulation .
For example , currently there is a <unk w="lack"/> of reliable data on this sector and this deficiency must be quickly addressed for management , safety and security reasons .
The Commission <unk w="must"/> make a clear distinction between large-scale commercial aircraft operations and privately owned airplanes .
The legislation <unk w="must"/> be proportional to the risks incurred by the different types of aviation and mindful in <unk w="terms"/> of the <unk w="financial"/> burden it places on them .
in writing . - ( <unk w="sv"/> ) <unk w="at"/> a time when we keep hearing the <unk w="word"/> ' crisis ' , it <unk w="is"/> not easy to talk about the stable future of general <unk w="to"/> business aviation .
We should be <unk w="aware"/> that in Europe about 50 000 aircraft are in use in general and business aviation , and almost four times as many small aircraft and gliders are used for sport and recreation .
In this context , ensuring proper capacity for the European <unk w="union"/> and <unk w="the"/> airports themselves is an extremely <unk w="sensitive"/> issue .
I would like here to draw attention to the significance of regional airports for ensuring cohesion of <unk w="workers"/> in the EU .
Mr President , the <unk w="debate"/> on the aviation industry is frequently distorted : there is a biased focus on the problems of emissions from <unk w="air"/> traffic but people <unk w="are"/> not prepared to see its potential .
This is true of <unk w="the"/> air transport and business and general aviation .
Although EU internal market legislation has mainly addressed commercial air transport , it is worth noting that issues to do with general <unk w=","/> business aviation are tending to crop up more and more in areas such as climate <unk w="change"/> , protection of <unk w="the"/> environment and aviation safety .
I wish to express a concern I have with regard to business <unk w="and"/> for aviation .
Small and medium-sized airports are crucial for both general and business aviation . Their establishment and modernisation should be promoted <unk w="by"/> Member <unk w="states"/> encouraged to invest .
From the perspective of climate protection , we can say that , although smaller aircraft <unk w="are"/> not included in the future Emission Trading System , a voluntary carbon-offset mechanism is being developed by the sector .
The aim must be nothing less than emission-free <unk w="freight"/> traffic .
- The next item is a short presentation of the <unk w="report"/> by Mrs Záborská , on behalf of the Committee on Women 's <unk w="rights"/> and Gender Equality , on non-discrimination based on gender and inter-generational <unk w="rights"/> .
The voting <unk w="in"/> the Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality was the result of much wide-ranging discussion and accommodation .
Their determination is an important contribution to national and European wealth and to the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> good .
This is the reason why men <unk w="and"/> women are being exposed to hidden forms of discrimination .
The obligation on society is to guarantee this freedom of choice and <unk w="freedom"/> to discriminate against any activity simply because <unk w="it"/> does not fall within the usual scope of the formal <unk w="internal"/> market .
This is a brief summary <unk w="of"/> my own-initiative report on non-discrimination based on gender and inter-generational solidarity .
Although it is a <unk w="very"/> technical report , it also has a human dimension .
There is something in it for all of us <unk w="and"/> each of us lives within networks of broader or narrower family and social relationships , in which we are personally involved .
Restricting the concept of inter-generational solidarity <unk w=","/> just childcare is a mistaken interpretation .
Inter-generational solidarity <unk w="also"/> involves responsibility with respect to our parents and elders and care for <unk w="them"/> .
It is the basis for the future of Europe <unk w="and"/> the common good of its inhabitants .
Human resources managers agree that human capabilities <unk w="are"/> comparable to university degrees .
Women are the first <unk w="to"/> contribute to inter-generational solidarity , thus participating in the creation of social relations .
Economists use mathematical models to highlight the value of <unk w="consumers"/> .
Longstanding research by economists and demographers suggests that <unk w="parliament"/> 's contribution to gross domestic product could be even higher if their unpaid work were factored in .
We must look forward in order to create the conditions for <unk w="protecting"/> women and men to become involved in inter-generational solidarity regardless of their social <unk w="rights"/> .
The European Union must act if it is serious about non-discrimination <unk w="and"/> equality of opportunity .
My political group , the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , is proud of its support for a policy of non-discrimination which pursues the general good and respects the distinct characteristics and complementary nature <unk w="of"/> men and women .
<unk w="in"/> my report , I have also taken account of the opinions of three of our Parliament 's Intergroups : ATD Quart Monde , the Intergroup on Family and Protection of <unk w="women"/> and the Intergroup on Carers .
Ladies and gentlemen , I <unk w="would"/> like to invite you to allow us to continue with this cooperation and to vote tomorrow for the FEMM Committee 's motion for a resolution .
Member of the Commission . - Mr <unk w="president"/> , I think Ms Záborská 's work is very important because the subject she is tackling is one which is of the utmost importance in our society .
The <unk w="level"/> of dependence will become more and more important in the future because of <unk w="the"/> ageing , <unk w="but"/> also because of equality between men and women as the care of children and <unk w="who"/> is still carried out mostly by women .
Therefore , we have to put into practice measures that help women enter or stay in the <unk w="world"/> market by improving family life conditions , especially those that facilitate a balance between professional and private life .
As specifically concerns the situation regarding the care of dependants , the Commission <unk w="has"/> already put the following actions on the table .
Filial leave to care for dependent family members was included in the consultation of <unk w="the"/> European social partners on the reconciliation of work , private and family life .
The Commission is also studying the quality of services <unk w="and"/> elderly dependent people and protection against <unk w="equal"/> treatment , as well as measures which <unk w="can"/> be taken at European level in cooperation with the Member States to speed up the development and modernisation of infrastructure and services .
The EU cohesion policy , through the European Social Fund , <unk w="will"/> continue to cofinance initiatives at national and local level .
The open method of coordination in the field of social protection and social inclusion pays particular attention to the modernisation of pension schemes to take greater account of new forms of work , career breaks and long-term care for dependent <unk w="purposes"/> .
We are working on this , and really look forward to <unk w="working"/> very closely with parliamentarians .
<unk w="i"/> would like to congratulate Parliament on the very important work done .
( EL ) Mr President , I <unk w="would"/> <unk w="like"/> <unk w="to"/> comment that , in this <unk w="report"/> which was adopted <unk w="by"/> an absolute majority in the Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality , there is also an alternative motion tabled <unk w="by"/> certain Members .
It is a defect in the new rules which <unk w="we"/> need to bear in mind .
We are applying Rule 45 which , <unk w="in"/> fact , provides a very strict framework for <unk w="the"/> speaking time , since only the rapporteur <unk w="will"/> take the floor .
Our Rules of <unk w="procedure"/> certainly ought to be developed to allow for greater flexibility and richer debates , but , as you will understand , <unk w="it"/> is not up to <unk w="us"/> to amend these Rules of Procedure this evening .
Apart from this , we must not forget that one of the biggest challenges in Europe in the <unk w="future"/> and long-term is the demographic situation .
The European Union is facing a bigger rise in the average age of its population than <unk w="the"/> regions of the world , along with a population growth of just 0.4 % , which means that the European Union will need , at the same time , to face up to a fall in the population able to work and an ageing <unk w="population"/> .
<unk w="citizens"/> of the European Union 's key values is to eliminate any form of discrimination .
Apart from eliminating discrimination , which also means between <unk w="sportsmen"/> and women , we have <unk w="a"/> responsibility to implement proactive measures to encourage professional careers for women .
<unk w="irrespective"/> of the fields in which women are hugely underrepresented is scientific research .
The highly competitive nature of research , <unk w="the"/> inherent geographical mobility associated with scientific work , along with establishing a career at a relatively late age all make this activity difficult to combine with family life .
I am taking advantage of the discussion of this topic to highlight the need to introduce specific policies aimed <unk w="at"/> <unk w="promoting"/> equality between men and women in the academic profession .
These policies must take into account a set of good practices at European level , such as facilitating dual careers , encouraging universities and research institutes to invest in childcare centres , as <unk w="well"/> as fast-track access to academic posts for women .
The <unk w="member"/> States of the <unk w="european"/> Union must support demographic renewal , incorporating their action into the renewed Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs , in line with the policy of equality between men and women .
A balance <unk w="between"/> European societies depends on the sum total of solidarity relations between the generations , which are <unk w="more"/> complex than ever before : young people continue to live in their parents ' home for longer periods , while it is increasingly common for those parents to have to look after their aging <unk w=","/> as well .
<unk w="the"/> burden that <unk w="therefore"/> represents rests primarily on the young and middle-aged generation , and especially on women .
For this reason , equality between women <unk w="and"/> men , that is to say , equal opportunities in the broader sense , would seem to be a fundamental condition for bringing about new forms of inter-generational solidarity .
With regard to family obligations , that is , the reconciliation of family life and work , the question of equality between <unk w="sportsmen"/> and women is clearly very important if European families are to gain new impetus .
It is also of critical importance to guarantee the opportunity for childcare of appropriate quality <unk w="and"/> quantity for those who would like to take up paid employment alongside childrearing .
The Socialist Group in <unk w="the"/> European Parliament is doing everything it can <unk w="to"/> ensure that the goals of Barcelona Process are met , and notes <unk w="my"/> disappointment that this objective is visibly absent from the Czech Presidency 's programme .
I wholeheartedly support the alternative <unk w="proposal"/> for a European Parliament <unk w="decision"/> on non-discrimination based on gender and inter-generational <unk w="exploitation"/> , which is more realistic than the preceding <unk w="year"/> .
Inequality in <unk w="the"/> performance of caring is often caused by the absence of affordable , available and high-quality services in Member States , and women are faced with the inevitability of sacrificing their opportunities to participate in <unk w="political"/> , economic and political life .
I am convinced <unk w="that"/> the implementation of this recommendation would perpetuate the traditional division of labour <unk w="between"/> men and women .
The measures planned in the <unk w="wake"/> of the Lisbon Strategy play an important role in establishing equality in the division of labour between women and men ; their objective , in addition to increasing employment , promoting innovation and raising productivity , must also be to eliminate in the EU the gender discrimination that has developed over time .
Ideal mothers who spent their youth caring for their <unk w="people"/> represent today the majority of <unk w="the"/> elderly female population and it is this childcare and homecare that is not reflected in their pensions .
Many <unk w="countries"/> <unk w="will"/> do not receive an appropriate <unk w="response"/> for this socially valuable work during their active life and this exposes them to a greater risk of poverty .
This is <unk w="also"/> a reason why young women are postponing motherhood and giving priority to a professional career .
<unk w="in"/> my many speeches in the House , I have constantly emphasised that mothers and <unk w="women"/> who freely choose to bring up their children or to care for elderly <unk w="people"/> <unk w="and"/> family members must <unk w="not"/> suffer discrimination .
In this speech , I should like to praise the proposals made <unk w="by"/> the rapporteur Mrs Anna Záborská , which recommend recognition not only of traditional forms of gainful employment but also of the manifold forms of non-gainful employment carried out in families as part of inter-generational solidarity .
However , it is not the case if one of the parents carries <unk w="out"/> this work .
At a time when Europe is facing a deep economic crisis whose final magnitude may be difficult to estimate , it is only to be expected that the birth rate will feel the negative repercussions of the turmoil on <unk w="the"/> labour market , as many women will <unk w="do"/> not to have children because they are terrified of the possibility of losing their job and of the reduction in the material resources required to care for and bring up their children .
These ' bridge-between-generation ' centres , <unk w="to"/> operate successfully in some Member States , <unk w="which"/> allow women who have had a child to return to work quite soon , while also making it easier for elderly retired people <unk w="to"/> return to employment .
In the last few decades <unk w="of"/> <unk w="terrorism"/> in the Member States of the European Union has increasingly aged .
This is why it is particularly important for the Commission to introduce practical initiatives for the official recognition of skills gained from <unk w="those"/> connected with <unk w="children"/> after children and dependent people , and household management , so that these skills are taken into account when rejoining the <unk w="internal"/> market .
Today we need to think about the <unk w="importance"/> of all these mothers who <unk w=","/> after children , who are the future of Europe , and protect them from the risk of one day receiving small pensions and being <unk w="in"/> an unequal position compared with other members of society .
Pre-commercial Procurement : Driving innovation to <unk w="ensure"/> sustainable high quality public services in Europe ( short presentation )
- The next item <unk w="is"/> a short presentation of the report by Mr Harbour , on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , on pre-commercial procurement : driving innovation to ensure sustainable high quality public services in Europe .
rapporteur . - Mr <unk w="president"/> , it is particularly appropriate <unk w="that"/> Mrs Reding is responding for the Commission tonight <unk w="that"/> <unk w="this"/> report is focused <unk w="on"/> a proposal that <unk w="has"/> been developed over a number of years with her services .
My first message to the Commissioner tonight is to thank her services for their leadership <unk w="in"/> this , but to say that I think this <unk w="debate"/> needs to be much better known .
Well , the core <unk w="of"/> the issue is that public authorities in the European Union spend huge <unk w="emphasis"/> <unk w="on"/> public money on buying products and services .
How much of that procurement is actually spent <unk w="on"/> investigating , researching <unk w="is"/> encouraging the development of new solutions to the <unk w="new"/> challenges that public authorities and indeed society face every day : a <unk w="new"/> <unk w="public"/> service , a better transport solution , dealing with climate change , more energy efficient buildings ?
Bearing in mind that we have an explicit objective in the Lisbon <unk w="strategy"/> to move our R & D spending up towards the 3 % target , there is huge potential here .
Essentially , <unk w="what"/> we are looking for are intelligent , research-focused public authorities to generate a demand <unk w="for"/> innovative solutions and then work with innovative companies large and small - but <unk w="also"/> small enterprises who really can benefit from this - to fulfil those requirements .
We want those intelligent customers to really think ahead , to be demanding , to think about the solutions for which no commercial solution yet exists , but where there are basically a range of solutions which can then be developed with the financial contribution from the public authority to <unk w="ensure"/> just that - to fund research and development , perhaps through a first competing stage of ideas , and then take those development solutions to a next stage <unk w="in"/> the viability of a product or service that can then be launched .
The benefits of having that backing , <unk w="as"/> a small enterprise in particular , and giving that commercial support will be really important to that business .
Indeed , where this <unk w="has"/> been already rolled out , we see the experience where businesses , even if <unk w="they"/> do not produce the winning solution , have had an element of their research and development funded that they can then go on and use <unk w="and"/> develop other revenue-generating products .
This also ties in with the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> initiative from the Commission covered in my report , the ' lead market initiative ' , where we are looking for public authorities <unk w="to"/> lead in a number of key technology areas around health and climate change in transport .
There are signs of an integrated policy <unk w="too"/> , but <unk w="the"/> report says that we need more training , we need more best practice , and we <unk w="need"/> more dispersion and dissemination of this proposal .
I hope that the Commissioner , and indeed the College , will pick up on <unk w="time"/> and that this Parliament will show it is right behind this solution .
In conclusion - and if you will allow me a short amount of extra time because this is , in a sense a point of order - I want to point out first of all to this <unk w="the"/> House that I had two opinions for my report from Mr <unk w="bushill-matthews"/> <unk w=","/> the Committee on Legal Affairs and Mrs Podimata from the Committee on Industry .
They are of course not allowed to present <unk w="their"/> opinions here , which seems rather a shame since they made valuable <unk w="contributions"/> which I <unk w="have"/> added to my amendments .
I also want to thank <unk w="you"/> shadow , Mr Hasse Ferreira , for working with me , and he has also contributed extensively .
<unk w="according"/> to wind up , this is a solution where everyone will be <unk w="represented"/> : society , citizens , public authorities , business , innovators and the European economy .
That is why it is so <unk w="important"/> and <unk w="that"/> , when we are looking to public authorities to continue investment <unk w="in"/> this time of economic crisis , this proposal is <unk w="much"/> more important than <unk w="it"/> was when I started <unk w="to"/> report a few <unk w="years"/> ago .
Member of the <unk w="commission"/> . - Mr President , I <unk w="do"/> <unk w="to"/> agree more , because pre-commercial procurement serves a twofold goal .
So <unk w="this"/> is money very well spent , above all in a time of crisis when we need to help our industry to put into practice the results of research and <unk w="to"/> make the best use of <unk w="alternative"/> solutions and innovations .
I am very glad that the rapporteur , Mr Harbour , together with the Commission , has supported what <unk w="has"/> been in the pipeline for quite a long time .
But there is a difference between being in the <unk w="eu"/> and <unk w="is"/> put into practice .
I <unk w="therefore"/> hope that Parliament 's report will become a trigger and an important element to add to our research <unk w="and"/> innovation policy .
What <unk w="will"/> the next concrete steps we will have to take ?
As an immediate response to the concrete <unk w="proposals"/> in the report , I can confirm that the Commission will support actions to promote the sharing of experience and awareness-raising , and will explore the means to provide incentives for <unk w="training"/> across a number of Member States in order to implement pre-commercial <unk w="these"/> projects jointly .
The Commission has already opened calls for proposals - in the INTERREG , <unk w="research"/> and FP7 programmes - to support the establishment of networks of public authorities on pre-commercial <unk w="ground"/> .
In the medium to long term , I believe that governments in Europe <unk w="are"/> <unk w="have"/> pre-commercial procurement in their strategic planning for public investments .
I think that <unk w="this"/> recovery packages <unk w="must"/> be a good place to start .
On <unk w="the"/> Commission side , I will emphasise this in a communication planned for early March this year , in which I will propose a strengthened strategy for ICT Research , Development and Innovation for Europe , so pre-commercial procurement will be included in this <unk w="directive"/> .
As you know , some Member States have already <unk w="gone"/> experimenting with <unk w="public"/> procurement pilot projects .
We can only make a difference if <unk w=","/> work together .
Driving innovation and developing the knowledge economy are key in ensuring <unk w="the"/> high quality public <unk w="service"/> .
The US public sector spends USD 50 billion per <unk w="year"/> on research and development procurement , which is twenty times higher than in the EU , and <unk w="the"/> Member States must honour their commitment to <unk w="only"/> 3 % of GDP in research and development .
There are today numerous European research programmes , the results <unk w="of"/> which have not yet been exploited by public <unk w="operators"/> through public procurement .
The <unk w="best"/> practice in the EU is based <unk w="on"/> exclusive development , which means that each company retains the ownership rights in respect of the new ideas it generates .
<unk w="the"/> authorities may be considerably assisted by the participation of universities and research <unk w="programmes"/> .
<unk w="member"/> States should be inspired by the experiences of the European innovation agencies taking part in research and development .
I believe that , on the basis of the <unk w="situation"/> in Malcolm <unk w="commission"/> 's report , the Commission will <unk w="have"/> a comprehensive , easy-to-understand handbook to provide in particular small and medium-sized enterprises and appropriate authorities in the field of public procurement with assistance in implementation .
It is only <unk w="through"/> close cooperation between EU Member States in the field <unk w="of"/> public procurement that we shall be <unk w="able"/> to drive innovation and ensure sustainable high quality public <unk w="service"/> .
The next item is report by Mrs Angelilli , on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties , <unk w="justice"/> and <unk w="home"/> Affairs , on a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on combating the sexual exploitation of children <unk w="and"/> child pornography .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to begin by thanking my fellow Members for their excellent <unk w="work"/> , which has enabled us , in my opinion , <unk w="to"/> draft a highly satisfactory text .
We set out with two key <unk w="points"/> , the first being to check carefully to what extent the 2003 framework decision is being implemented within <unk w="the"/> 27 Member States , and <unk w="the"/> second being to propose improvements <unk w="are"/> necessary .
The fact is that the framework decision must be updated to increase the level of protection for minors , <unk w="in"/> light of the rise in new and disturbing cases <unk w="of"/> exploitation linked to new technologies .
From this point of view , extra-territorial cooperation should <unk w="be"/> improved and Member States should be asked to rule out the principle of double criminality for crimes concerning the exploitation and <unk w="exploitation"/> of children .
The aim of this is to categorically eliminate the <unk w="way"/> that perpetrators of <unk w="such"/> abuse could hold jobs that involve contact with children .
This system has already been trialled and implemented , although by only a small number of Member States and so only at trial level , <unk w="has"/> <unk w="has"/> given excellent results .
It is worth remembering , in fact , that every year in <unk w="italy"/> , thousands and thousands of children disappear without trace .
I would <unk w="like"/> to highlight <unk w="one"/> further aspect : in general , national legislative authorities must commit to improving protection for child victims during investigations and before and after any court case in which children are involved .
<unk w="however"/> , we have highlighted the need for urgency in criminalising forced marriages , the majority of which concern children .
To conclude , Mr President , I believe it is important to ask all Member States to ratify as soon as possible the most recent <unk w="council"/> of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse .
Vice-President of the <unk w="commission"/> . - ( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would first like to thank Mrs Angelilli warmly for her remarkable report .
I would also like to thank her for the <unk w="commitment"/> she has worked with the Commission on a very delicate , sensitive subject about which we feel so strongly .
Sexual abuse and the various types of exploitation , especially child pornography , are despicable crimes with deep-seated , long-lasting effects <unk w="of"/> its young victims .
Some sources say that between 10 and 20 % of children in Europe have suffered one form of sexual attack <unk w="on"/> another during their childhood .
The framework decision of 2004 establishes a minimum level of harmonisation for national <unk w="sovereignty"/> in respect of criminalisation and jurisdiction .
Despite the incompleteness of the information , the Commission considered , in a 2007 report , that the framework <unk w="directive"/> had , in general , been satisfactorily implemented .
The development of the Internet is contributing to the proliferation <unk w="of"/> new threats for our <unk w="citizens"/> .
Sex tourism to third countries for the <unk w="benefit"/> of abusing children is a reality , whilst it is <unk w="completely"/> unknown for abuse to be committed by individuals who have <unk w="been"/> convicted in other Member States .
At the end <unk w="of"/> 2007 , they negotiated a convention with the Council of Europe to introduce a very high <unk w="level"/> of protection .
Parliament demands better <unk w="information"/> and especially a substantial improvement in the European framework , with a set of features to reinforce the fight against these crimes .
I have announced a review of the existing European legislation on the issue and will submit a proposal for adoption by the <unk w="council"/> in March .
I want to put an <unk w="forward"/> text on the table that will deal not only with enforcement but also protection for victims and prevention .
Most of the report 's contents should find a place in the new framework decision , but if this proves not to be <unk w="used"/> , for technical or legal reasons , we will try to identify the most suitable tools to implement any proposals left out of this framework decision .
We will see if there is a possibility for political initiatives , particularly to use dialogue with third countries , or even to provide ourselves with financial instruments , as is the case for the existing <unk w="directive"/> .
Mr President , <unk w="ladies"/> and gentlemen , I am pleased to note Parliament 's desire to move forward with the adoption of ' kidnap warning ' mechanisms in each Member State .
I have to say , at the last meeting of the interior and justice <unk w="minister"/> , I argued with much determination that it was necessary to provide each of the Member States with a ' kidnap warning ' system .
To be <unk w="more"/> effective , these systems would , <unk w="of"/> course , have to be interconnected .
Once again , I would like to thank the <unk w="european"/> Parliament for its <unk w="constructive"/> commitment .
I also <unk w="recall"/> <unk w="mrs"/> Angelilli , <unk w="he"/> has unquestionably given us a high quality report .
The members of <unk w="the"/> Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality have specific questions and suggestions relating to the proposal .
Of course , <unk w="it"/> is also the responsibility of the users , but the states must take action .
For example , I believe that Europol is an important tool which , combined with <unk w="an"/> effective network of <unk w="education"/> and a special unit whose members have had training <unk w="and"/> very specific issues , can be used to combat child <unk w="abuse"/> and prostitution .
We must also resolve the question of extraterritoriality <unk w="and"/> taking a joint European approach .
We need more background information in the form of concrete studies on the social situation of the victims , because family members themselves <unk w="are"/> often responsible for abusing children and putting them on <unk w="the"/> net .
I hope that the Commission is prepared to work closely with <unk w="the"/> Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality so that we can resolve these questions together .
on <unk w="behalf"/> of the PPE-DE Group . - Mr <unk w="president"/> , Europol 's organised crime report of 2006 stated that the advantages the Internet offers in terms of information and communication technology are extremely beneficial to organised crime .
There is no doubt , in this regard , that <unk w="they"/> are the most vulnerable group .
Besides classmates and games , they use ' unknown user ' networks via chat rooms on websites , which are perfect contact points for paedophiles using false identities to lure <unk w="the"/> victims .
According to Internet Watch <unk w="management"/> , which processed more than 30 000 reports in 2006 , 91 % of victims were under 12 years old .
Eighty per cent were female , <unk w="a"/> child abuse domains totalled more than 3 000 .
Moreover , 55 % <unk w="of"/> all child abuse domains were hosted in the <unk w="member"/> States , 28 % in Russia and only 8 % in Europe .
It would <unk w="be"/> appropriate to put cooperation in the field of disabling websites abusing children on the agenda of an EU-US meeting .
We are witnessing a well-organised international network of paedophiles and organised crimes <unk w=","/> with the sex industry , as stated by Mrs Angelilli .
It is almost incredible that eight <unk w="amendments"/> are still missing in the case of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children , child prostitution and child pornography ; four in the case of the Palermo Protocol , <unk w="which"/> is the basic document for international cooperation in combating trafficking in human beings .
Slightly less than half of the Member States <unk w="have"/> still not ratified the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime .
Therefore , it is time to send a strong <unk w="and"/> clear message to the Council to revise the Council framework decision combating the sexual exploitation of <unk w="children"/> and child pornography .
Mr <unk w="president"/> , Commissioner Barrot , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by thanking Mrs Angelilli and everyone else for their very constructive cooperation .
You will surely remember how little was done at the beginning <unk w="of"/> this parliamentary term , but with the children 's strategy a year ago , the issue of children 's rights turned a corner .
The decision we are to make here now concerns a child 's right not to be sexually abused and the combating of <unk w="child"/> pornography .
I <unk w="shall"/> , <unk w="of"/> course , particularly happy with the three proposals that I managed to get accepted in the <unk w="committee"/> on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs and <unk w="which"/> I hope will be retained through the vote today .
It <unk w="is"/> very important to be able to protect both young girls and young boys <unk w="from"/> sexual crimes , sexual abuse and sexual exploitation throughout the EU .
The second <unk w="aim"/> is to protect children against child sex tourism by all Member States criminalising sexual crimes both within and outside the EU .
This means that those who commit crimes will never be able to be sex tourists and exploit the poorest and youngest children and young people in other countries because prosecution and punishment <unk w="and"/> await them when they arrive home , wherever that is in the EU .
The third proposal is that we should now seriously tackle the Internet and , together with the largest credit companies , develop the technical means , <unk w="with"/> the help of banks and exchange bureaux , Internet service providers <unk w=","/> search engine providers and , of course , <unk w="the"/> travel industry , to close down payment systems when payment is made for sex crimes and violations or the sexual exploitation of <unk w="children"/> and young people .
The same opinions are found everywhere where people are striving to get websites closed down and that <unk w="will"/> that children come before confidentiality and that the abuse of children and young people must be reported .
With this report <unk w="we"/> can now sit back and be satisfied that , here in Parliament , we have taken the first step in respect <unk w="of"/> the rights of children , and when we get a new Treaty of Lisbon , children 's rights will also be a legal basis and a goal within the EU , and this is not before time .
Mr President , although the <unk w="individual"/> systems of Member States make <unk w="need"/> for sanctions against the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography , it is still necessary to raise the level of <unk w="safety"/> of our children .
It should be <unk w="noted"/> that children who use new technologies , and especially the Internet , are at risk <unk w="of"/> contact with potential perpetrators of sexual offences .
<unk w="in"/> connection with the <unk w="problem"/> which exists , Member States should be <unk w="called"/> upon to block access to Internet sites which <unk w="shipowners"/> child pornography .
I would echo what has been said by our colleague , Ms Bauer , in terms of our own Member States taking action to sign and ratify some of the <unk w="laws"/> and protocols which are <unk w="now"/> at the moment .
If we are looking for a common <unk w="approach"/> and a <unk w="new"/> approach , these are very key reference points which also help to send a signal from Member States that they , too , are concerned about these issues .
I think <unk w="it"/> is one of the <unk w="way"/> things they should be doing , and it would be interesting to know why certain Member States <unk w="have"/> not yet actually signed up to the relevant conventions and protocols .
We welcome much of the report in terms of the rights-based approach , which I would like to see leading on and away from <unk w="the"/> view that it is <unk w="not"/> about criminal justice .
We need those clear measures to support children who have been victims - whether through court proceedings , where obviously the key issue is to find the truth but not in a way that leaves children <unk w="from"/> traumatised than they were at the <unk w="end"/> of the process , or through the collective work on identifying children .
We should encourage Internet literacy among children as well their own understanding of what the <unk w="citizens"/> are and what they should be looking for so that they , too , can play an active part in helping to combat these crimes .
We intend to support certain <unk w="of"/> the amendments this morning , particularly where we think there are certain principles <unk w="which"/> we tamper with at our peril - such as on double criminality and confidentiality in certain professions - and one <unk w="or"/> two others where we think the concept perhaps needs further definition .
We are , however , generally very much in favour of this report and look forward to its <unk w="further"/> progress .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( SV ) This report <unk w="shares"/> the support of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left .
The sexual exploitation of children <unk w="and"/> child <unk w="abuse"/> are abhorrent crimes , the prevention of which requires international cooperation .
These films and images can be seen <unk w="from"/> over the world and increased international cooperation is therefore <unk w="impossible"/> to stop <unk w="such"/> violations .
We know that there are definite connections <unk w="in"/> the sex slave trade <unk w="and"/> the sexual exploitation of <unk w="children"/> .
We do not know how many children are bought and sold <unk w="for"/> commodities to be sexually exploited , but we do know that it is a lot , and we know <unk w="that"/> every child that is <unk w="what"/> is one child too many .
The adult world must take responsibility <unk w="for"/> protecting our children from this , one of the worst crimes that a child can be subjected to .
In this debate , we must not forget that <unk w="some"/> of the crimes against children are committed within the family or within the family 's circle of friends and it is therefore <unk w="necessary"/> for society to ensure that children have other adult contacts so that they have someone they can turn to for help .
All citizens who commit sexual crimes against children must be punished , regardless of whether the crime is committed within or <unk w="in"/> the EU .
<unk w="an"/> explosive increase in criminal activities via <unk w="the"/> Internet requires a coordinated approach .
We should , however , exercise caution when it comes to prescribing detailed sentences <unk w="of"/> this abuse at European level .
The Member States themselves will need to make every effort to penalise the <unk w="advantage"/> of modern media .
Internet child porn will need to <unk w="be"/> regulated in the Member <unk w="states"/> ' criminal law .
<unk w="the"/> Council should , in line with the prohibition against pursuing one 's profession , commit to closing the loopholes in the legal network , so that exploitation and transmission via the Internet do not move to countries where there is no adequate legislation .
I would have liked to hear from the Commission whether it would also <unk w="be"/> possible to discuss this with non-EU countries , but the Council is absent , unfortunately .
It is an <unk w="issue"/> <unk w="where"/> there are thousands of people who have been charged <unk w="with"/> child <unk w="uranium"/> <unk w=","/> and have spent not so much as a single day in prison .
I would also like to remind the rapporteur , Mrs Angelilli , the quality <unk w="of"/> whose work <unk w="we"/> have all admired , that in <unk w="the"/> city last year , there was a case known as ' Lotus flower ' , involving 200 Roma children .
Once the case was <unk w="there"/> , these Roma children virtually disappeared ; no one knows whether they in fact went back to the same camps where the abuse took place .
All Member States must therefore be vigilant , special legislation must be <unk w="defined"/> , and this outrage , this horrible threat to society , must be addressed with special and extremely severe laws .
( HU ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this House is <unk w="debating"/> a topic today which rightfully outrages all people of <unk w="political"/> will .
Yet all our children are <unk w="in"/> danger , as the victims of the sexual exploitation <unk w="of"/> children and child <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> multiply .
We must ensure that the sanctions laid down in national legal systems are effectively applied , and <unk w="a"/> daily practice reflects this struggle .
We must <unk w="be"/> particularly vigilant regarding the constant challenge posed by the use of new online technologies - web cams , mobile phones and , in particular , the use of the Internet - in this regard .
In <unk w="this"/> case , we must emphasise that these are serious crimes , and that in order to detect them , it is essential to remove any obstacles in the way of the smooth exchange of <unk w="law"/> enforcement records among Member States , to allow <unk w="the"/> creation of <unk w="new"/> databases for information on offenders .
I consider it <unk w="very"/> important and absolutely essential that the existing international documents be ratified by the Member States , and that their contents be effectively implemented .
We must make sure that child safety <unk w="is"/> a <unk w="crucial"/> issue in all EU Member States .
Mrs Angelilli 's excellent report contributes to <unk w="this"/> effort , and we support it with our vote as well .
( ES ) Mr President , sexual exploitation is a reality endured by boys and girls all over the world , since there is a supply of <unk w="an"/> sexual exploitation , particularly in poor countries , and a demand for Internet pornography <unk w=","/> sex tourism on the part of rich countries .
To achieve <unk w="this"/> , we must <unk w="focus"/> attention on Member States so that - as Spain has done , beyond transposing the Council 's framework decision on this matter , - we can develop and implement action plans in which interest groups are involved , including public awareness and social mobilisation programmes , without <unk w="having"/> to work on international cooperation .
Finally , I would like to add my voice to calls urging Member States to sign , ratify and apply all the relevant international <unk w="regulations"/> so that we may guarantee that the rights of minors are respected .
( ET ) Mr President , <unk w="madam"/> Vice-President of <unk w="the"/> Commission , Mrs Angelilli , ladies and gentlemen , the rapid <unk w="pace"/> of information and communication technology has created a new channel for criminals to perpetrate or present their crimes .
The crimes that are the subject of the report have been discussed in various global and <unk w="international"/> forums .
In 2003 , the <unk w="future"/> of the European Union passed a binding framework resolution on the sexual exploitation of children and the struggle against child pornography , and the contents of that resolution have today largely been integrated into Member States ' legal systems .
I am glad that the commission will soon have completed a new updated framework <unk w="programme"/> .
<unk w="the"/> Member States must define the concept of ' child <unk w="embryos"/> ' and declare the sexual solicitation of children through the Internet to be a crime .
<unk w="however"/> , surveillance cannot be used in the case of second-degree crimes , and data protection is also often an obstruction .
In my home country , there have been cases , even recently , where a minor committed suicide due to the activities of an <unk w="individual"/> harasser .
There have <unk w="already"/> been such cases in other Member States .
There must be zero tolerance <unk w="for"/> <unk w="death"/> and child pornography in the European Union .
It is a disgrace of today 's world and a grave sign of <unk w="this"/> decline .
These are now more urgently required than ever , and must <unk w="be"/> applied in an increasingly efficient and exemplary fashion .
Mrs Angelilli 's excellent report , on which I warmly congratulate her , and the specific recommendations that <unk w="i"/> will make to the Commission , indicate and suggest <unk w="that"/> that can <unk w="we"/> curb the spread of child pornography , online grooming <unk w=","/> children , sex tourism and all forms of child abuse .
According to an <unk w="agreement"/> by the International Labour Organisation , <unk w="more"/> than 12 million people are victims of forced labour , of whom more than 1 million are involved in sexual exploitation and between 45 % and <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> % are children .
<unk w="instead"/> of online grooming of children have certainly increased , but I would like to take this opportunity to denounce the exploitation of images of women also .
In the majority of EU countries , an often disgusting view of womanhood is propagated , where the commercial aim is pursued not only with vulgarity but with a real contempt for women 's dignity , not to mention the use of subliminal advertising and also television programming - <unk w="and"/> all in my country , I have to say .
I agree <unk w="with"/> the rapporteur <unk w="and"/> Council Framework Decision 2004 / 68 should be updated to increase the level of protection for children and to better combat sexual exploitation in general .
The ratification of the Council of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="eec"/> is just as important , but we must not stop <unk w="ourselves"/> : we also need to criminalise the online grooming of children <unk w="and"/> press for <unk w="european"/> cooperation in this field .
In my opinion , Member States should <unk w="be"/> obliged to exchange the <unk w="views"/> contained in <unk w="the"/> records relating to sexual abuse convictions - and I believe that the ECRIS system is certainly a step forward on this front - in order to prevent those who have committed certain crimes from having contact with children and therefore to improve protection for victims , not just during investigations , <unk w="but"/> also after trials have been concluded .
I would like to close by <unk w="saying"/> that <unk w="view"/> of <unk w="human"/> exploitation unfortunately encompass more than just sexual abuse , and I would like to see a greater commitment from our institutions on those other areas .
( EL ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I should like to congratulate Mrs Angelilli on her exceptional work on such a sensitive issue which <unk w="concerns"/> us all .
Reinforced <unk w="cooperation"/> with the private sector could make an effective contribution towards limiting the number of websites hosting child pornography .
For example , <unk w="they"/> could <unk w="be"/> promoted with credit card companies to fight child pornography on the Internet at European level by using their systems for payments to commercial sites selling photographs of children .
In addition , the new <unk w="framework"/> programme to protect children using the Internet will help to promote a safer online environment .
The Council of Europe Convention signed by 20 Member States of <unk w="the"/> European Union is the first international legal act qualifying the various forms of <unk w="the"/> exploitation of children as a criminal offence .
In order to <unk w="deal"/> effectively with this phenomenon , Member States need <unk w="to"/> <unk w="take"/> <unk w="any"/> form of coercion of children to take part <unk w="in"/> sexual activities .
Finally , I consider it very important to take account of paedophile registers and to prohibit them from accessing jobs or voluntary work which brings them into <unk w="close"/> contact with minors .
Given that the new technologies and , in particular , the constant development of the Internet and the new <unk w="production"/> methods used by paedophiles , it is of paramount importance that the level of child protection be increased .
These are already widely used by certain European Internet service providers , and I believe that others can also <unk w="have"/> partners in this effort .
The packages address four basic safety topics - safety and communication , entertainment , downloading , and virtual violence , and , in a playful manner , <unk w="their"/> families help with the safe use of the Internet .
Therefore , <unk w="it"/> is of paramount importance that <unk w="countries"/> whose work involves regular contact with children be required to report any situation in which sexual <unk w="exploitation"/> has occurred .
Illegal material involving child abuse should be <unk w="used"/> <unk w="on"/> the Internet at source and websites should be blocked by providers .
Indeed , the telecom legislation review which we are <unk w="doing"/> at the moment in the European Parliament , along with the Council and Commission , offers a good opportunity to improve the legislation .
Perpetrators of sexual abuse should be denied the opportunity to pursue professional activities <unk w="and"/> involve contact with children .
Finally , I believe that the <unk w="european"/> Commission and Member <unk w="states"/> should <unk w="have"/> financial and logistical support for <unk w="information"/> campaigns aimed at <unk w="women"/> and children .
I am especially pleased because , until now , <unk w="the"/> left-wing groups in Europe have been fighting openly for the greatest possible sexual freedom , while <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> giving attention to the consequences of this course of action in relation to children .
There have even been attempts to form <unk w="political"/> political parties .
This <unk w="will"/> fill every <unk w="every"/> citizen of the European Union with <unk w="it"/> .
Taking the opportunity of this discussion , <unk w="i"/> should <unk w="be"/> drawn to the violation of children 's rights and the sexual exploitation of children of immigrants from outside Europe .
There cannot be some laws for the traditional peoples of <unk w="europe"/> and others <unk w="and"/> immigrants .
( CS ) <unk w="mr"/> President , ladies and gentlemen , this is undoubtedly an important issue requiring effective cooperation by all Member States .
The reasons range from increasing family breakdown and the growing number <unk w="of"/> children brought up in single-parent families , to greater <unk w="movement"/> of citizens and the spread of modern information technologies .
That is why I am <unk w="not"/> in favour of the report .
I believe that <unk w="the"/> sex education for children is relevant to the <unk w="issue"/> of sexual abuse of children , but <unk w="it"/> should also be addressed at parents , educators and social and health professionals .
It <unk w="is"/> important that everyone gains a proper awareness of such crimes while acknowledging first of all that they do exist , so <unk w="that"/> they can detect potential abusers and prevent the abuse .
I would <unk w="like"/> to draw your attention to the fact that child sex offenders have a high repeat offence rate .
However , if somebody commits such an offence two or more times , then we should be able to prevent them from committing <unk w="these"/> crimes .
Since <unk w="this"/> <unk w="signs"/> of time can lapse between offences being repeated , information on tendencies to commit such crimes should be kept <unk w="on"/> record over the long term .
I <unk w="would"/> also recommend the compulsory vetting of persons applying to work as teachers , coaches and youth supervisors for past sex offences .
In my experience , child sex offenders often try to circumvent bans on working with children <unk w="from"/> using various ruses , including false identities , to <unk w="need"/> to regain access <unk w="to"/> their targets .
The free movement of people in the European Union gives <unk w="them"/> greater scope for doing so .
Sex exploitation of children is a crime against the most vulnerable in our society <unk w="."/> I am , therefore , shocked that seven of our Member States in the European Union have still not signed the Council of <unk w="europe"/> Convention ; nor , <unk w="unfortunately"/> , have eight of these states ratified the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention on the <unk w="rights"/> of the Child on the sale of children , child prostitution and child pornography .
The fact is that the Internet now provides new routes for these crimes , and I therefore think it <unk w="is"/> incumbent on us to urge that the acts of using the Internet for child pornography and for grooming children be made a criminal offence .
We have to cooperate and coordinate our efforts in order to ensure <unk w="we"/> can do it .
Indeed , in all Member States , it should be possible <unk w="for"/> any citizen or person living in the European Union who committed a crime outside the European Union to be brought before the courts .
Mr President , I would also like to congratulate <unk w="mrs"/> Angelilli for her very fine report .
Unfortunately , this is <unk w="what"/> is going on on the Internet .
The Internet is a wonderful tool , a wonderful source of <unk w="respect"/> for all of us and something <unk w="that"/> will be part of our lives into the future .
However , there <unk w="are"/> those who prey on <unk w="them"/> and they will use the Internet as much as they possibly can to try to undermine children .
I think Member States should work together to introduce a network <unk w="of"/> contact points for the public to reach in order to report illegal and harmful content <unk w="of"/> conduct .
It is important that both parents and children <unk w="and"/> secure using the Internet and have a point of contact to report any wrongdoing .
In order to <unk w="find"/> <unk w="those"/> who are responsible for <unk w="their"/> grooming and pornography accountable , we should see this for what it is .
It is a crime and should <unk w="be"/> treated as such .
I consider it regrettable that some Member States have yet to adopt the measures necessary for the implementation of this framework decision , even <unk w="though"/> the deadline for them to do so has already passed .
It is essential that all Member States <unk w="coordinate"/> all types of sexual abuse of children and that all European citizens who <unk w="suffer"/> a sex crime against children in any country within or outside the European Union be subject to uniform extraterritorial criminal legislation applicable throughout the Union .
I also support the revision <unk w="of"/> the framework decision so that it guarantees at least the same level of protection as the 2007 Council of Europe Convention .
It is also important to strengthen this framework decision in <unk w="relation"/> to the most recent technological developments in the field of <unk w="transport"/> .
Children make ever greater use of the Internet , which has <unk w="been"/> one of the preferred tools of potential and actual offenders , in particular through the grooming and fraudulent solicitation of children for unlawful purposes to which Mrs Angelilli has already referred .
I take this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur on <unk w="his"/> excellent work <unk w="and"/> on the report which she has submitted to us .
I am aware of the complexity and difficulty of this struggle , but I believe that it is possible to confront the sexual exploitation of children with unified action and a <unk w="new"/> effort .
The emphasis should be given to prevention , by promoting campaigns to make parents and children aware of the risks of child pornography , specifically on the <unk w="internet"/> and , in particular , the risk of sexual exploitation in online chat rooms and forums .
( PL ) Mr President , it was the poet Zbigniew Herbert who said , ' We must learn to say ' <unk w="workers"/> ' ( ... ) ' no ' is a very significant part of speech .
Today we must say ' no ' to the violation of fundamental children 's rights , ' no ' to violence and the sexual exploitation <unk w="of"/> children , ' no ' to depravity and pornography on the Internet and ' no ' to sex tourism .
Rapid crime detection and strict enforcement of penalties <unk w="are"/> imperative .
These <unk w="countries"/> must <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> the whole world , because in some countries there are organisations which question the penalising of sexual contact with children .
However , as you said that you would be tabling your <unk w="second"/> proposal <unk w="in"/> March , I should like to ask for this proposal to be in <unk w="accordance"/> with numerous policies of the European Union and not move in just one direction .
This proposal will need to make provision for criminalisation , strict <unk w="coordination"/> and cooperation with Europol , whose convention is the first to mention trafficking in human beings .
I refer to the phenomenon of trafficking in abandoned infants which we have seen emerging on the Internet and , <unk w="when"/> I say Internet , I mean not just the World Wide Web and the chatrooms which children enter from their bedrooms , but also the numerous other means , including mobiles , <unk w="that"/> children can use , which is why we need to make provision for all the parameters .
When we talk about a criminal offence , we also need to think about the situation in correctional facilities and <unk w="training"/> .
If we cut down on the number of people in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="world"/> , <unk w="will"/> have an increased risk of such phenomena .
We need to protect victims and their families , given that violence by abusers is <unk w=","/> and the means which they use are stronger than the means of defence available to victims , because they are mainly economic .
I trust therefore that your new proposal will feature a stronger level of protection for <unk w="citizens"/> and high-specification means .
We <unk w="must"/> remember that all the support we receive in the form of filters and monitoring service suppliers on the Internet does not relieve us , as parents , from our obligation to protect and warn our children .
Perhaps it is difficult to get <unk w="it"/> away from <unk w="their"/> computers .
Today , those strangers are not lurking outside the school <unk w=","/> a bag of <unk w="life"/> , they enter Internet chat rooms and seek their victims there .
We should teach our children that they must not talk to <unk w="it"/> , and likewise on the Internet , shut the door in their face .
Our <unk w="emphasis"/> on the Internet is obviously very important , but it suggests that this problem is a new one , when we clearly know that it is a very old problem and was very well hidden .
It happened not just outside schools with bags of sweets , but it happened in homes , in all of our Member States , <unk w="the"/> churches and in hospitals .
The Internet has perhaps shone a light on this very dark part of society which we are still grappling with , <unk w="and"/> grappling very badly with .
It is very <unk w="important"/> that Member States take seriously their many fine words about protecting children , just as we in this House have spoken very much about how we value and protect children , whereas in <unk w="all"/> , our actions are often much weaker than the strong words we speak .
I mentioned that the home is sometimes the most dangerous <unk w="conditions"/> for children .
I would also add that those who believe that small <unk w="companies"/> , where everyone <unk w="is"/> one another , <unk w="in"/> a safe place for children , need to think <unk w="carefully"/> .
In small towns , <unk w="which"/> very often <unk w="in"/> their eyes because they do not want to speak about ' soft information ' that they have , and are perhaps afraid to pass <unk w="it"/> on to the authorities .
I call on the Irish Government to bring forward legislation on a wide range of measures to protect children against sexual <unk w="exploitation"/> .
They should not be in conflict : both deserve protection <unk w="in"/> our Constitution .
Madam President , I welcome this debate and , <unk w="in"/> line with the accompanying motion for a resolution , I encourage all EU Member States to sign and ratify the Council of Europe <unk w="and"/> on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse .
I also urge all EU Member States to sign up to the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children , Child Prostitution <unk w="and"/> Child Pornography .
The Council <unk w="of"/> Europe Convention is the first international legal instrument to categorise the various forms of <unk w="the"/> abuse of children as criminal offences , including such abuse perpetrated with the use of force , coercion or threats , even within the family .
However , seven EU Member States have still not signed this Convention , and eight Member States <unk w="are"/> still to ratify the UN Optional Protocol .
While I accept that Irish criminal law protecting children against sexual abuse and exploitation is quite comprehensive , I would , nevertheless , urge the Irish Government to bring forward up-to-date legislation as soon as possible to deal with the proliferation of new ways <unk w="in"/> which children can be subject to sexual abuse .
We cannot allow to otherwise ignore the fact that prevention <unk w="of"/> this phenomenon is part of the battle against it : to educate children and parents how to avoid coming into contact with this phenomenon and with the people involved in it ; to limit all types of advertising which provoke open and aggressive sexuality ; that there is more concern for children in various institutions , who often become victims of sexual violence ; integrating efforts for averting child trafficking - one of <unk w="the"/> main reasons for trafficking is namely sexual exploitation ; and to form networks consisting <unk w="of"/> non-government and government structures as a countermeasure .
Madam President , it is truly <unk w="unacceptable"/> and shameful that , in the 21st century , with respect to sexual offences against children , the level of cooperation between different services within a state - but <unk w="also"/> of cooperation between Member <unk w="states"/> themselves - is not what it should be .
I congratulate both the Commissioner and the rapporteur for speaking <unk w="very"/> clearly and for stressing the need for actual improvement .
I further ask them to name publicly those Member States that have deficient legislation in <unk w="this"/> respect .
One measure I suggest should be considered is the establishment <unk w="of"/> a pan-European - or even better , <unk w="or"/> - public <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of offenders convicted of sexual offences against children .
I propose that such a <unk w="measure"/> should be permanent , with no possibility of anyone 's name being erased from it unless there has been a court decision reversing the original conviction .
( PL ) Madam President , 20 <unk w="member"/> States have signed the Council of Europe Convention , the first international legal document which classifies the sexual exploitation of children as a crime .
<unk w="advances"/> in science and technology and in new methods of communication , <unk w="and"/> especially the Internet and mobile telephony , have also revealed a new way of luring children into sexual exploitation , as well as a new <unk w="method"/> of distributing child pornography .
The introduction <unk w="of"/> penalties for this kind of activity under the criminal law of all <unk w="member"/> States is essential .
However , the introduction of criminal <unk w="networks"/> for such acts is not sufficient .
Another imperative is the establishment <unk w="of"/> systems <unk w="which"/> will prevent situations in which the danger of sexual exploitation of a child would be possible , such as by the education of parents and children , and also by tracking down paedophile <unk w=","/> which are active on <unk w="the"/> Internet .
I thank Mrs Angelilli for a very important and well prepared <unk w="report"/> .
Child protection must always be a priority issue in all countries of <unk w="the"/> European Union <unk w="where"/> children are the most vulnerable group <unk w="of"/> society .
Harmonisation <unk w="of"/> laws would be a great contribution <unk w="to"/> preventing crimes of this kind and it would help in the more effective prosecution of offenders in all Member States .
Child protection is <unk w="therefore"/> needed in respect of children 's access to the web , where they are exposed to <unk w="all"/> kinds of content , including possible abuse by paedophiles , and to Internet grooming .
( RO ) Sexual exploitation of children and <unk w="child"/> pornography are very serious crimes which are on the increase , but which can be combated through legislation , including awareness campaigns .
As a mother myself and an MEP from a country which is among the main locations for hosting websites featuring pornographic content , I feel that <unk w="the"/> Member States need clear laws which ensure that child pornography is banned from the Internet , while making Internet service providers block public access to websites which post such images .
Given that access <unk w="is"/> , and the distribution of , pornographic material are not controlled by time and place , I welcome the timely suggestion to set up , at European level , a separate unit for combating child pornography and prostitution and I suggest that Member States and the Commission provide financial support for <unk w="european"/> <unk w="public"/> awareness campaigns .
Firstly , I do not believe that prosecuting parents who coerce their children into forced <unk w="and"/> <unk w="their"/> <unk w="them"/> .
Realistically , it is impossible to prove this within a family where there is also an <unk w="automatic"/> right to remain silent .
Regardless of these two reservations , I appeal to the Member States , the Council and the Commission , including the Czech Presidency , to <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> update the relevant European and national legislation and to ratify international agreements for effectively combating paedophilia .
The age <unk w="responsible"/> for sexually motivated crime should also be harmonised .
I would also like to point out that Member States <unk w="intend"/> to finance the development and expansion of programmes which will help parents to protect their children from <unk w="their"/> grooming .
Madam President , I believe <unk w="this"/> debate has <unk w="been"/> the European Parliament 's unanimous <unk w="decision"/> to the protection of children .
I am trying to be as clear as I can : I would <unk w="point"/> out that we are going to review the framework decision dealing with child protection .
We <unk w="need"/> to improve its contents to bring child protection in the European Union up to the <unk w="source"/> of the highest international standards , particularly the <unk w="forthcoming"/> 2007 Council of Europe Convention , and best <unk w="practice"/> practices .
In terms <unk w="of"/> criminal investigations , the legislative <unk w="measures"/> will include new criminal offences to deal with the new forms of abuse which are being facilitated by <unk w="new"/> technologies .
It will be <unk w="possible"/> to carry out investigations and bring charges .
Furthermore , and especially , we will organise prevention by managing offenders on the basis of an individual diagnosis and a <unk w="qualitative"/> assessment for each offender .
In addition , we will try to prevent and minimise the risks of repeat offending and introduce <unk w="measures"/> <unk w="to"/> ensure the optimum effectiveness of safety mechanisms in the entire Union .
We will also take the opportunity to propose more <unk w="concrete"/> measures at this level to prosecute crimes of sexual exploitation committed in third countries by citizens of EU <unk w="citizens"/> , even if the third country in which the crime is committed is unable to do so .
Obviously , Mrs Angelilli , <unk w="you"/> will follow all the recommendations in your report most carefully as we develop this framework directive .
Madam President , ladies and <unk w="gentlemen"/> , I would also <unk w="like"/> to say to <unk w="you"/> that it is not enough to have a good legal framework .
This is why , at European level , around Europol , we are trying to build a platform which can be used to bring together information gathered in the Member <unk w="states"/> and distribute reports and statistics from the national platforms .
In <unk w="this"/> matter , the European Union can offer added value , provided that we can succeed in creating this platform around Europol .
I <unk w="would"/> also say that we have a further <unk w="debate"/> in which I have a lot of <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , in other words , the informal public-private group created by the Commission , which has introduced a European financial coalition against commercial child pornography images .
In the face of a quadrupling <unk w="of"/> the number of sites between 2003 and 2007 , we have to involve the private sector , as it controls a large part of the IT infrastructures .
This is a major <unk w="step"/> in bringing an end to a number of commercial practices which are exploiting such child pornography .
I would add <unk w="that"/> , last week , we had a <unk w="very"/> nice data protection day .
I am not saying that things are perfect , but a major <unk w="effort"/> is being made and , of course , we need to mobilise the entire Internet community .
I wish to stress the concept of ' kidnap warnings ' , because they have not <unk w="been"/> the subject of many speeches .
It really is important for Parliament to encourage the Member States , as it did in its <unk w="part-session"/> of 2 September 2008 , to <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> themselves with warning systems and to conclude cooperation agreements to achieve cross-border trigger mechanisms .
In addition , you have also very generously created a budget line to encourage Member States to create these mechanisms , or at least to create links between <unk w="them"/> to deal with ' kidnap alerts ' .
Now , before <unk w="the"/> European Parliament , I would lay particular stress on the <unk w="matter"/> that is child kidnapping , often carried out for the purposes of pornography .
I would again like to thank the European Parliament for its support in the struggle <unk w="to"/> protect children .
I would also add that I have noted the speeches on data protection during legal <unk w="acts"/> involving children .
Madam President , ladies and <unk w="gentlemen"/> , I would like to thank my fellow Members once again for their <unk w="commitment"/> <unk w=","/> the <unk w="commitment"/> shown during the debate and , in conclusion , I <unk w="would"/> like to extend a special thank you to the European Commission for its active collaboration .
To Mr Barrot I owe a particular debt of <unk w="austria"/> , since even this morning he demonstrated extremely strong political and legislative will in <unk w="need"/> of child protection .
Too often we lack sufficient data , statistics , <unk w="which"/> are indispensable as a basis for our <unk w="future"/> in better monitoring , better understanding and , of course , better combating child abuse .
This lack of data is - how <unk w="-"/> I put it - a recurring issue , <unk w="and"/> I think it important to emphasise since it is a shortcoming that we must overcome .
I would like to <unk w="say"/> that I am very aware of data protection and I do not believe that there is a conflict between privacy and children 's rights , if , of course , <unk w="the"/> institutions play their part and if everyone , from the providers to the police , respects the rules .
Mr Barrot mentioned this too : often during legal proceedings , <unk w="but"/> a scandal breaks in <unk w=","/> the victim is sadly a child , it is precisely the exploited child that is fed to the media without any form of protection , and I would say without <unk w="knowing"/> compassion either for their image or for their privacy , and all simply to boost television ratings and sell a few more newspapers .
I will conclude , <unk w="mr"/> President , by saying that clearly a significant effort is needed at a cultural and political level , and this effort must be made <unk w="for"/> families , schools and the media .
One of the features of sexual abuse of children has been its rapid spread with the help of the Internet , making it all the more difficult <unk w="to"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
It must become a legal obligation to block <unk w="and"/> to websites which spread child pornography .
We cannot help but be concerned by the gap that exists between generations in terms of Internet usage <unk w="and"/> , by extension , in terms of controlling children 's access to websites posing a high level of risk .
It is extremely important to establish communication between the school and family in order to educate children in how to <unk w="all"/> risk situations and respond .
This is the reason <unk w="for"/> <unk w="the"/> information and education programmes are useful , not to mention a European strategy for combating sexual abuse and more <unk w="effective"/> cooperation <unk w="between"/> Member States aimed <unk w="at"/> setting up a transnational police network for tackling child pornography and prostitution , as <unk w="well"/> as a network for managing a database containing the details of people <unk w="out"/> of such acts .
in writing . - This report recognises that the violation of a child 's dignity is a serious breach of <unk w="human"/> rights , as well as a despicable act , which , unfortunately , is not tackled uniformly throughout the EU .
It is disturbing that some Member States have not implemented all relevant international conventions for the protection of <unk w="minorities"/> .
I urge the Commission to use all tools at its disposal to <unk w="assist"/> those states into compliance .
To fight child pornography , the EU should <unk w="have"/> tough legislation , but also undertake educational projects that <unk w="address"/> people about this subject .
Existing technical solutions to protect children should be promoted among <unk w="women"/> , in particular , software tools that are easy to use and available for free or at a low-cost .
Low barriers of entry and minimal <unk w="payments"/> are making it very easy for criminal organisations to get into cyberspace .
Being the future of any society , children are , at the same time , the most <unk w="important"/> group of it .
I warmly welcome the comprehensive report which <unk w="calls"/> upon all Member States to address the problem in question with utmost seriousness .
I support the call to <unk w="assist"/> seven Member States which have not yet signed the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection <unk w="of"/> Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse .
Furthermore , I join the call upon all Member States to sign , ratify and implement <unk w="the"/> relevant international conventions to protect our children .
Nevertheless , signing and ratifying <unk w="it"/> is merely providing a framework for improvement .
<unk w="we"/> need to grow up in a safe environment for which parents have the primary responsibility .
Urging <unk w="the"/> Member States to coordinate their actions , I <unk w="fully"/> support the idea to set up the Missing Child Alert System which would improve the cooperation on this issue on the European level .
<unk w="it"/> is very important that seven Member States and neighbouring countries sign the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual <unk w="abuse"/> and Sexual Abuse .
<unk w="the"/> implementation of the <unk w="commission"/> 's framework resolution is also important .
Those who have fallen victim to abuse at an early age must be guaranteed full protection <unk w="for"/> <unk w="an"/> investigation , before and after judicial proceedings .
What is taking <unk w="place"/> on the Internet has surpassed all limits .
Children are often unable to <unk w="surrender"/> the seriousness and consequences of a situation .
Thus , we must ban paedophiles ' <unk w="s"/> rooms and <unk w="economic"/> forums , and make solicitation using such methods a criminal offence .
We must keep sexual <unk w="noise"/> away from children , and we must take the necessary steps to ensure that .
Estonia is one of the countries in which the process of strengthening <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> those who have committed crimes against children is currently underway .
The world <unk w="of"/> <unk w="agency"/> is , unfortunately , <unk w="in"/> the place in which parents have been unable to act as guides for their children .
I , for instance , represent a country <unk w="where"/> Internet use is among the highest in the EU , but parents ' disregard is also among the highest in the EU .
It is very important that parents be informed and that awareness programmes for children be launched on the Internet , because only <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> % of ( Estonian ) children claim that they have approached their parents for help in connection with unpleasant <unk w=","/> they have <unk w="been"/> on the Internet .
The essence of this work has been to prepare a directive which , for the first time , lays down sanctions <unk w="for"/> employers who benefit from the work of illegal immigrants .
I believe we <unk w="have"/> succeeded in changing the philosophy behind this directive , which had been confined solely to fighting illegal immigration .
The compromise text agreed <unk w="that"/> <unk w="the"/> Council also provides some protection for those immigrants forced to work illegally , who are often held hostage by criminal organisations .
<unk w="therefore"/> , Madam President , there would have been a risk of <unk w="giving"/> them twice over , both as exploited workers , often forced to <unk w="improve"/> indecent working conditions , and as illegal immigrants who have to be repatriated , with the repatriation ban which , in many countries , means years and years .
In this context , in Articles 7 and 14 , we have provided that , in cases involving minors , serious exploitation or people trafficking , the Member States will be obliged to draw up rules for issuing temporary residence permits , the term of which may be extended until any <unk w="time"/> due has been paid .
We should have liked this possibility <unk w="to"/> be extended to all illegal immigrants , but that is prevented by the Return Directive <unk w="made"/> last year .
For the first time , it <unk w="is"/> for criminal sanctions <unk w="to"/> be imposed in the worst cases , including those where <unk w="the"/> regular workers are minors .
I think the additional sanctions laid <unk w="down"/> in Article 8 are important .
They include withdrawal of licences , closure <unk w="and"/> <unk w=","/> in particularly serious <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , and exclusion from state aid derived from European funding .
Otherwise , we would be guilty of extraordinary hypocrisy : we would be punishing <unk w="them"/> with one hand yet still giving them generous subsidies with the other .
I believe it is fundamental that we have succeeded <unk w=","/> including a definition of <unk w="ensuring"/> that equates the pay due to an illegal immigrant with the pay of a regular worker , without <unk w="any"/> discrimination .
We <unk w="have"/> included temporary work agencies in the scope of the directive .
In certain countries - such as my <unk w="own"/> - in particular , these are the organisations that most readily recruit illegal workers under the very worst kinds of exploitative conditions .
Just think of the cases where illegal agricultural workers have been hired , which <unk w="has"/> long filled the crime columns .
We have successfully asked <unk w="the"/> <unk w="for"/> trade unions to be able to represent immigrants in administrative and <unk w="political"/> <unk w="interests"/> .
The text <unk w="also"/> mentioned third parties in general , but now it mentions trade unions .
We need a running-in period to see <unk w="that"/> it works , and we have therefore asked the Commission to report to Parliament and the Council after the directive has been in force <unk w="within"/> three years , specifically about the rules on inspections , residence permits , sanctions and subcontracting .
On the subject of subcontracting - Article 9 , which was the subject of discussion between Parliament and <unk w="the"/> Council and within the Council itself - your rapporteur would have like to extend liability to the whole contracting chain , as the Commission had originally <unk w="proposed"/> .
The Council and Parliament , or rather part of Parliament , were for excluding subcontracting entirely , but we have reached a compromise solution that I believe is workable : dual liability , which should <unk w="not"/> prevent us from legislating again on this issue in future .
That is why tomorrow , for my part <unk w=","/> on behalf of the other shadow rapporteurs , whom I thank for the collaboration they have given <unk w="me"/> during <unk w="the"/> <unk w="few"/> years , I shall ask the Council to add a statement to the compromise text on which we are <unk w="going"/> to vote , to the effect that the provisions of this <unk w="directive"/> 9 shall <unk w="not"/> prejudice any future legislative action on subcontracting .
In conclusion , Madam President , I believe this directive lets us envisage a Europe in which immigration has finally become a matter <unk w="of"/> collective responsibility and recognised rights , and not just of rules against immigrants .
Madam President , I would , of course , like to thank Mr Fava and <unk w="the"/> Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice <unk w="and"/> Home <unk w="affairs"/> .
Major efforts have been made by various <unk w="countries"/> to reach an agreement at first reading and , given the broad majorities in favour of this on the LIBE Committee several days ago and on the Permanent Representatives Committee just before Christmas , I think we will get there .
This directive lets us introduce an effective instrument , a common framework to discourage the employment of workers from <unk w="third"/> countries who are residing illegally .
The compromise text recommends better targeted , <unk w="environmental"/> inspections , so it remains to be seen <unk w="in"/> the coming <unk w="years"/> if these qualitative criteria have been used and if the obligation on Member States to regularly identify the risk sectors for illegal working on their territory has been really effective .
This is what we want , in order to fight against the employment of people from third countries residing illegally and , above all , to impose sanctions on the <unk w="those"/> who profit from these people .
In addition , there are , of course , positive results emerging from this compromise , particularly the <unk w="progress"/> achieved on the difficult question of subcontracting .
I have noted that Mr Fava was hoping for a statement from the Council <unk w="and"/> Parliament .
They are necessary to reinforce the deterrent since , in the most serious cases , administrative sanctions are not sufficient to <unk w="protect"/> unscrupulous employers .
Madam <unk w="president"/> , ladies and gentlemen , this directive is a first significant step in the fight against illegal immigration .
<unk w="these"/> targets the practices of unscrupulous employers , whilst protecting migrant workers who , most often , are the victims in such cases .
My thanks go to Parliament , Mr Fava <unk w="and"/> the LIBE Committee .
However , on the other <unk w="hand"/> , <unk w="we"/> can <unk w="only"/> see its possible effect on improving conditions for competition and I also believe that it will help to combat <unk w="drug"/> trafficking .
There is a view that this <unk w="proposal"/> will not bring added <unk w="value"/> .
As no such legislative <unk w="procedure"/> exists yet at Community level , for some Member States , the added value is high , while for others , where such legislation already exists , the added value may not be evident .
In discussions of possible compromises with <unk w="the"/> Commission and the Council , the discussions concentrated on particular problem areas .
Firstly : the issue of the contractor 's liability for obligations under law on sub-contractors , where the draft proposal limits the liability for the actions <unk w="of"/> direct sub-contractors .
<unk w="thirdly"/> : the means of ensuring effective procedures by which <unk w="economic"/> migrants can be paid outstanding wages where we have pursued the principle of non-discrimination , and we looked for a way to provide available help to illegal migrants and to provide tools for them to receive wages even after their return to their home country .
Thirdly : the possible effect of <unk w="ensuring"/> the execution of the return of an illegal <unk w="entry"/> until that person receives their <unk w="right"/> .
And finally , the problem of inspections has <unk w="been"/> left to Member States in the knowledge that labour inspectors play a vital role in making the legislation effective .
No doubt there are various views on how to resolve this <unk w="and"/> other problems in this draft .
I would like to finish by thanking Mr Fava , the Commission and the French <unk w="presidency"/> for successfully incorporating the compromises .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality . - ( NL ) I , too , should like to thank <unk w="the"/> rapporteur for his work , without overlooking the efforts , though , of the shadow rapporteur of the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , Mr Busuttil , and the social affairs rapporteur , Mrs Edit Bauer .
It is , after all , thanks to their efforts that the compromise reached ultimately does what it is supposed to do , namely take away the prospect of work as an incentive for illegal immigration by actually penalising workers who <unk w="are"/> staying in <unk w="the"/> European Union illegally .
Contrary to what some parties in this Parliament tried to achieve in the first instance , this legislation has not become an instrument for <unk w="combating"/> legalising illegal immigrants .
Indeed , the debate on legal migration is being <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> elsewhere .
As rapporteur for the Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality , I do believe , though , that more thought should be given to gender issues when dealing with this group of people who are staying in the European <unk w="union"/> illegally and , as has already been stated , are often the <unk w="result"/> of exploitation .
Estimates of how many people from third countries are staying in the European Union illegally are <unk w="sufficiently"/> precise and vary between <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> and 8 million .
Moreover , these estimates give no indication as <unk w="regards"/> the proportion of men and women in that total , and neither do they grant an <unk w="fat"/> into the gender-specific problems <unk w="of"/> illegal female immigrants face .
I would <unk w="draw"/> your attention to the fact that female illegal immigrants are very vulnerable and that they are often at the receiving end of forced labour , human trafficking and violence .
I am pleased that the arbitrary 10 % <unk w="of"/> level that was suggested initially has now been dismissed and that a risk approach has been incorporated in <unk w="the"/> compromise text .
The reports in the Belgian newspaper De Standaard last <unk w="week"/> about house slaves in certain embassies <unk w="in"/> Brussels , only a stone <unk w="or"/> throw from the Berlaymont building , prove that these scenarios are not far-fetched .
I would therefore like to say <unk w="that"/> the European Commission that the proof of the pudding is in the eating .
Face up to your responsibility to examine critically how countries deal with this legislation <unk w="and"/> whether they apply it effectively .
This law , Madam President , is probably one of the first that directly tackles the illegal immigration phenomenon using legislative tools , and now it can be said that this <unk w="report"/> has finally arrived .
It was sorely needed and <unk w="which"/> I am extremely pleased that we have managed to reach an excellent compromise here .
The incentive is that a <unk w="person"/> living , for example , in Africa might have to risk his life in order to journey to <unk w="that"/> country , thinking that he might find work there , even if illegally .
From now on , we are <unk w="carrying"/> out the <unk w="natural"/> <unk w="result"/> that illegal employment will no longer be tolerated and therefore it makes no sense to make the crossing over to Europe , while under the mistaken impression that there are jobs to be had here .
As the previous speaker said , it is <unk w="important"/> that this instrument is not used <unk w="in"/> regularise irregular situations , but should serve as a clear message that <unk w="insecure"/> employment can no longer be tolerated .
These also <unk w="seek"/> to pass on the unequivocal message to employers that we shall no longer tolerate the recruitment <unk w="of"/> workers without a permit .
Madam President , we have managed here in the European Parliament to radically change <unk w="the"/> objective of the directive which we are debating today .
<unk w="thirdly"/> , we have helped to ensure that provision is made for strict and binding criminal sanctions for employers of immigrants <unk w="'"/> unacceptable living conditions .
Thirdly , we have safeguarded the right of trade unions and other <unk w="parties"/> to go to court on behalf of immigrants and , fourthly , we have imposed the right to grant residence <unk w="permits"/> of short or longer duration to illegal immigrants who uncover criminal organisations .
In other words , we are at last treating illegal immigrants as human beings , without at <unk w="the"/> same time legalising illegal immigration , which is why <unk w="we"/> support this compromise .
However , there is still a dangerous mismatch between the continuing police approach to illegal immigration and the reality in <unk w="the"/> Member States .
<unk w="this"/> <unk w="would"/> lead thousands of illegal immigrants into poverty , <unk w="terrorism"/> and crime and , although we demonstrably cannot or <unk w="do"/> not deport them , these illegal immigrants may remain out of work .
If , in fact , numerous illegal immigrants are currently occupying jobs in Europe which Europeans do not want , we should now be debating in this House , at long last , common rules on legal <unk w="persons"/> into Europe and <unk w="the"/> legalisation of these people , not new rules <unk w="and"/> deport them .
Finally , the absolutely necessary fight against the black labour market obviously does not only concern illegal immigrants ; it mainly concerns legal immigrants , it concerns millions of European citizens whose employment rights are <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> underfoot by their employers on a daily basis , it concerns the fact that employment laws <unk w="are"/> being trampled underfoot , without any material control or material sanctions .
Today <unk w="the"/> directive should therefore have as its legal basis , in my opinion , the <unk w="continued"/> fight against undeclared work in Europe , not immigration in particular .
This targeting of immigrants every time something goes wrong in Europe <unk w="is"/> very dangerous for social cohesion in our countries .
Obviously , illegal immigration also <unk w="needs"/> to be <unk w="respected"/> , but we cannot demonise people who are fleeing miserable conditions in their own country in the hope of a better life .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( NL ) For years , <unk w="the"/> European Union has had to contend with the presence of millions of illegal immigrants on its territory , and the pressure to find a solution is mounting .
Indeed , if we wish to adopt manageable and reliable migration policy , in which refugees are entitled to protection <unk w=","/> in <unk w="which"/> we create transparent opportunities for legal <unk w="redress"/> , then an approach that takes due account of all discouraging and encouraging factors that lead to illegal <unk w="immigration"/> is a necessary measure .
Last summer , the Council and Parliament reached agreement on what was known as the Return Directive , which <unk w="mainly"/> focuses on the illegal immigrants themselves , whereas today , we are looking at the employers who do not hesitate to employ illegal immigrants .
This is not only a significant inducement for illegal immigrants , but also unmistakeably creates cases of abuse and <unk w="economic"/> exploitation .
<unk w="but"/> a rather slow start , there is now , following intense negotiations with the Council , a compromise before us that is acceptable to me , and I <unk w="would"/> like to thank the rapporteur for his constructive and pragmatic way of working .
It was like a breath of fresh air <unk w="transport"/> , in fact , cannot be said of a few of his fellow MEPs who now insist , at any price , on this accompanying written declaration , a show for the Bühne , which does not do much for the image of this <unk w="parliament"/> .
It should be clear that neither the European Commission nor the European Parliament have magic wands at their disposal when it comes to <unk w="law"/> or enforcement .
All I can do <unk w="is"/> <unk w="would"/> urge you to turn this enforcement into reality <unk w="so"/> as to ensure that we do not get bogged down with empty words on paper once more as , indeed , <unk w="the"/> benefits from <unk w="it"/> .
<unk w="this"/> proposal is <unk w="therefore"/> a step in the right direction when it comes to achieving comprehensive migration policy .
<unk w="we"/> still have a long way to go though , so what we <unk w="can"/> do now is persevere .
In this connection , I would like to ask the 64 thousand dollar question that has been on everybody 's lips <unk w="is"/> : why is the Council absent from this debate ?
<unk w="the"/> facts prove <unk w="positive"/> , and we also see this in Mr Fava 's explanatory statement , where we read , amongst other things , that ' [ i ] t is estimated that there are between 4.5 and 8 million illegal immigrants in the EU , a figure that is steadily increasing , notably because of easy access to illegal work . '
The very fact that the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> from 4.5 million to 8 million are used shows that we are not even able to state precisely the scale of this problem and issue .
And yet , economic migration also <unk w="involves"/> <unk w="the"/> EU <unk w="member"/> States , especially those which acceded more recently .
Today , <unk w="talks"/> of Poles and citizens of other countries are moving within the EU <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> old Member States .
These citizens are <unk w="subject"/> to the same ills and are in the same situation as migrants from third countries .
For illegal employment means the exploitation of <unk w="a"/> while denying them the benefit of health insurance or pension rights , the exploitation of juveniles and even human trafficking .
We can overcome this phenomenon only when there are severe legal sanctions and when <unk w="we"/> consistently make use of them .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE <unk w="group"/> . - Madam President , we very much appreciate <unk w="the"/> work of <unk w="congratulating"/> Mr Fava in the <unk w="committee"/> on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs and Ms Bauer in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
As has already been said , this is supposed to be part of the common immigration policy of the European Union , dealing with the pull <unk w="out"/> of possible work , often within the informal economy and amongst vulnerable and non-organised workers .
However , it can also apply where there are genuine vacancies , which cannot be filled from the national labour pool , and where Member States are not issuing sufficient work permits , or <unk w="if"/> there is a creaking bureaucracy that cannot respond quickly enough to <unk w=","/> with a labour-market purpose .
There is also a <unk w="problem"/> that we have yet to fill for people for whom no return to their country of origin is possible - for example , to Zimbabwe - and who are <unk w="not"/> left legally destitute , as it were , and , therefore , need to <unk w="go"/> a way to keep themselves alive .
The <unk w="majority"/> of Member States already have , in theory , measures in place to deal with the situation of irregular migration , and you would think that would signal an apparent commitment to action .
Yet the Commission proposals on inspection in its original document have been really watered down , and Parliament has had to <unk w="do"/> to get even what we have currently in Article 15 .
It is to <unk w="be"/> hoped that <unk w="environmental"/> inspections will <unk w="not"/> just pick off small businesses but will actually look at some of the larger enterprises that rely very heavily , at the bottom end , <unk w="to"/> vulnerable workers .
That is why the issue <unk w="of"/> subcontractor liability was extremely important to many of us in <unk w="this"/> House .
Some of us consider <unk w=":"/> what we are left with is , again , a watered-down version of the <unk w="commission"/> 's original proposal .
<unk w="one"/> of the issues that <unk w="are"/> concerned many of us is remuneration - when you cannot determine what the length of an <unk w="individual"/> contract was - and issues regarding payment of national insurance and <unk w="pensions"/> , which we know for many vulnerable workers are often taken out of their pay packets but not necessarily handed on to the authorities .
