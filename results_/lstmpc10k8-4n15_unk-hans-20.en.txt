Add to this <unk w="message"/> from team to team the loss <unk w="of"/> a <unk w="of"/> this past fall .
The co-operative agreements <unk w="in"/> <unk w="many"/> areas as <unk w="well"/> , forestry , mining and economic development <unk w="is"/> extremely important to the citizens of New Brunswick .
The <unk w="same"/> speed and <unk w="the"/> edge of short track have been attracting a worldwide following .
We are not talking about submissions by witnesses but about his own members who came out in favour of applying the GST to health care <unk w="and"/> medication .
With the <unk w="view"/> <unk w="and"/> assumptions that we have made in <unk w="the"/> budget and <unk w="in"/> the interest rates continue <unk w="and"/> they are right now , we <unk w="are"/> <unk w="succeeded"/> in at a lower cost of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="that"/> we had in our budget .
My question is this : <unk w="""/> the Minister of Justice tell <unk w="me"/> whether he has <unk w="taken"/> measures to appoint without delay at least one francophone judge <unk w="before"/> the Court of Queen 's Bench in Saskatchewan ?
<unk w="the"/> <unk w="this"/> is an adverse reaction <unk w="which"/> is <unk w="the"/> <unk w="members"/> of the House and the <unk w="time"/> to come <unk w="up"/> with legislation that reflects these things .
By <unk w="considering"/> the advice <unk w="of"/> the standing committee we recognize in a non-partisan <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> importance of consulting members of Parliament before we introduce legislation .
When you see two <unk w="french"/> departments get in one another 's way like that , thus delaying concrete action , it is easy to understand that the people of Quebec want to have in <unk w="their"/> own <unk w="of"/> the power to make decisions .
With your permission I would like to seek consent of the <unk w="commission"/> to make a <unk w="serious"/> <unk w=","/> as chair <unk w="of"/> the committee of the environment and <unk w="parliament"/> development
These petitioners draw to the attention of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> Commons that sections 41 and 42 of the Constitution Act , 1982 <unk w=")"/> that an amendment to the Constitution of <unk w="parliament"/> in relation to certain matters may be initiated <unk w="by"/> a <unk w="majority"/> of the House of Commons .
If it exists we feel it would <unk w="be"/> very important <unk w="for"/> us <unk w="to"/> see it .
Ms. <unk w="subject"/> : Mr. <unk w="industries"/> , the publishing world <unk w="will"/> be looking at this debate to rank the abilities of the aspiring mystery writers in this Chamber .
Why does <unk w="the"/> Liberal <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="speak"/> and openly violate the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="penalty"/> on foreign investments in the field of publishing ?
How can she now <unk w="be"/> such a lack of willingness to investigate the <unk w="possibility"/> of taxpayer dollars ?
The government also <unk w="contributed"/> quickly to <unk w="congratulate"/> the EH-101 deal .
I sent a letter to the Prime <unk w="minister"/> asking five questions .
[ <unk w="mr"/> <unk w="/"/> Leroux ( Richmond -- Wolfe ) : Mr. Speaker , first of all , <unk w="allow"/> me to congratulate the hon. <unk w="on"/> <unk w="on"/> the Reform <unk w="process"/> on her speech which , in my opinion , was very sound .
Today as in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="case"/> , the river remains <unk w="the"/> main corridor for the transportation of goods <unk w="from"/> the interior of the continent .
Following <unk w="all"/> of the <unk w="debate"/> <unk w="made"/> by the then <unk w="the"/> <unk w="out"/> of the Coast Guard , <unk w="which"/> Hugessen added this : `` His <unk w="report"/> fills us <unk w="a"/> deep <unk w="concern"/> .
Let me <unk w="also"/> <unk w="by"/> informing the House , as the previous member has , that the St. Lawrence <unk w=","/> is truly a national treasure .
<unk w="i"/> <unk w="this"/> , however , <unk w="does"/> not permit us to keep every <unk w="details"/> and the canal system <unk w="leading"/> to navigation throughout the entire year .
Flood control is not a by-product of <unk w="promoting"/> the port of Montreal open , as some would <unk w="like"/> us <unk w="all"/> .
Of <unk w="course"/> , eight are based in the maritime region of the coast guard , six are based <unk w="on"/> the Laurentian region , four are located <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="mediterranean"/> region , and two are located in the Great Lakes <unk w="region"/> .
Since the seaway opened there has been <unk w="an"/> extension to the shipping season of <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> weeks on the <unk w="so-called"/> <unk w=","/> section and <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> weeks on <unk w="the"/> <unk w="august"/> .
The west coast has <unk w="had"/> ships with only two icebreakers .
I was particularly interested in the remarks <unk w="by"/> <unk w="my"/> friend <unk w="of"/> <unk w=","/> who mentioned the <unk w="direct"/> subsidies that create an artificial freight rate with <unk w="regard"/> to grain and <unk w="korean"/> seeds .
It is precisely on the Coast Guard <unk w="that"/> I wish to draw the <unk w="attention"/> of <unk w="this"/> House , and not so much on <unk w="the"/> amount which will be spent for it , but on the way it <unk w="can"/> be spent .
I should point <unk w="out"/> that as a result of this <unk w="outbreak"/> in the Criminal Code <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> such as Clifford Olson , for example , <unk w="has"/> become eligible to apply <unk w="to"/> be released from prison in less than two years .
Mr. Pat O'Brien ( London <unk w="/"/> <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> ) : Mr. Speaker , in <unk w="fact"/> this petition the petitioners make <unk w="reference"/> to the <unk w="extent"/> that conversion of oil pipelines to <unk w="the"/> gas <unk w="sector"/> presents a number of risks to landowners .
However , we have a <unk w="situation"/> in which <unk w="it"/> means that little boys and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="have"/> <unk w="are"/> <unk w=","/> with a <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> perception <unk w="and"/> <unk w="which"/> each of them belongs <unk w="to"/> society .
Ms. Val Meredith ( <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> White Rock -- South Langley ) : Mr. <unk w="""/> , I <unk w="have"/> problems with the House <unk w="and"/> trying <unk w="to"/> control whether or not I ever use chairman as a term <unk w="of"/> reference in my discussions .
Even in the <unk w="middle"/> of a simple break and enter , <unk w="but"/> offender should have <unk w="to"/> listen <unk w="to"/> <unk w="the"/> sense of violation the victim feels .
<unk w="from"/> pain these parents feel is even greater knowing they have lost a child <unk w="with"/> a murder victim .
<unk w="in"/> every court case , in every courthouse in this country day <unk w="'s"/> day and prosecution <unk w="and"/> prosecution <unk w="at"/> issue is whether the <unk w="commission"/> can prove against an accused person criminal wrongdoing <unk w="in"/> accordance with those standards <unk w="and"/> integrity and <unk w="democracy"/> .
<unk w="this"/> aspect has to do with ensuring that <unk w="the"/> laws on the books are effective and can be enforced effectively .
<unk w="this"/> <unk w="first"/> step <unk w=","/> I will ask the <unk w="commission"/> to <unk w="amend"/> the statute in its entirety over to a <unk w="number"/> of Parliament so that a thorough review can <unk w="be"/> made of the Young Offenders <unk w="involved"/> in this , the 10th <unk w="report"/> <unk w="of"/> its life .
I am certain improvements are <unk w="important"/> but I am equally certain this <unk w="-"/> will result in a confirmation of the <unk w="new"/> approach which the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="should"/> Act <unk w="accordingly"/> .
Again , I am referring to the view that many people in society have of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> department .
I can say <unk w="that"/> it will <unk w="be"/> spent will <unk w="be"/> determined in consultation with the provinces <unk w="of"/> the local authorities and community groups which may know best how most value can be received for the money .
As <unk w="far"/> as I am concerned , this question creates competition between the rights <unk w="of"/> one and the other , <unk w="and"/> I think this duality was very well defined by <unk w="the"/> two <unk w="fellow"/> members who <unk w="mentioned"/> earlier .
<unk w="article"/> 8 gives `` everyone the <unk w="right"/> <unk w="to"/> be <unk w="directed"/> against unreasonable <unk w="oppression"/> or <unk w="not"/> . ''
Since we <unk w="are"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> of the Minister of Justice <unk w=","/> in this <unk w="european"/> Parliament , and <unk w="i"/> heard them again in the House this morning , we will have an <unk w="opportunity"/> to get some messages across <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> him .
The government wants to update and amend this legislation , but <unk w="it"/> was <unk w="not"/> in the House , in some very obvious cases this legislation <unk w="is"/> not even enforced .
We can pass as many bills <unk w="if"/> <unk w="we"/> want , but <unk w="in"/> the legislation we adopt is <unk w="being"/> enforced , if we do not <unk w="have"/> the political will to do so , what <unk w="is"/> the use ?
Turning <unk w="to"/> some <unk w="the"/> backward <unk w=","/> in our criminal justice system , we <unk w="endeavour"/> our law enforcement officers , our RCMP <unk w="must"/> , <unk w="we"/> do not pay <unk w="it"/> very well .
Another <unk w="approach"/> that could take place <unk w="will"/> be to allow our workforce to adjust hours <unk w="so"/> that there <unk w="is"/> at least <unk w="just"/> one parent <unk w="or"/> <unk w="another"/> .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> in <unk w="all"/> <unk w="have"/> said <unk w="that"/> every <unk w="new"/> baby , just after it is born , should have a <unk w="good"/> <unk w="effect"/> and the brain scan should be done to prevent a lawsuit ensuing in the <unk w="way"/> if things showed up in that baby <unk w="of"/> development .
<unk w="i"/> lawsuits that this obstetrician is trying to prevent are lawsuits that involve huge amounts of money in <unk w="the"/> court system and huge amounts of money in terms of the actual awards that <unk w="are"/> given , settlements of up to $ 7 million .
The <unk w="end"/> result <unk w="of"/> the meeting -- <unk w="at"/> this was a meeting <unk w="which"/> had a number of solicitors <unk w="that"/> it -- was to suggest that no fault <unk w="of"/> insurance would go a long way <unk w="to"/> <unk w="putting"/> the gladiatorial events of doctors <unk w="and"/> lawyers in our court system .
We on this side of the House and I <unk w="hope"/> the people of Canada will watch with great interest and <unk w=","/> as his leader takes on <unk w="the"/> role <unk w="of"/> <unk w="any"/> moral activity <unk w="and"/> moral responsibility with regard <unk w="to"/> their <unk w="eu"/> membership .
That has been the <unk w="subject"/> of <unk w="the"/> questions here <unk w=","/> to better education , <unk w="vocational"/> training for the <unk w="environment"/> , a better <unk w="educational"/> system and <unk w="training"/> .
After many phone calls to the RCMP , <unk w="the"/> provincial court wrote a <unk w="report"/> for $ 50 <unk w="who"/> arrived on November <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> .
Our goal <unk w="is"/> Reformers <unk w="in"/> this House <unk w="is"/> <unk w="to"/> make <unk w="sure"/> that laws are passed that put the rights of the <unk w="child"/> first , ahead of all other <unk w="sectors"/> , especially the rights of criminals .
In fact , we <unk w="should"/> not be entitled to our rights until <unk w="the"/> <unk w="to"/> discharge our <unk w="resolution"/> .
These are set aside <unk w="for"/> a victim services fund , but there is no legal obligation on the part of the province to spend the revenue collected exclusively on victims .
When criminals <unk w="are"/> serving <unk w="the"/> -- and I am talking about low <unk w="weather"/> offenders now , those who do <unk w="not"/> pose a risk of physical violence -- they should <unk w="be"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> programs .
They <unk w="must"/> not be <unk w="in"/> the luxury of lounging around at taxpayer funded correctional centres .
Many times <unk w=","/> we send people <unk w="to"/> prison , instead of improving <unk w="their"/> <unk w="their"/> attitude and their lot <unk w="and"/> so on , they in <unk w="fact"/> deteriorate <unk w="and"/> <unk w="will"/> get to mix with other <unk w="people"/> who may <unk w="be"/> of more <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> than they are .
If they <unk w="are"/> <unk w="that"/> we get <unk w="into"/> the situation <unk w="in"/> which people in our <unk w="countries"/> tell <unk w="the"/> people what they <unk w="can"/> have and what they cannot have , not only the <unk w="future"/> .
The Minister of Justice has said he has <unk w="dealt"/> with the provincial and territorial <unk w="human"/> <unk w="""/> .
<unk w="it"/> <unk w="having"/> said that from the <unk w="fact"/> a child is born to that child 's <unk w="own"/> birthday <unk w="at"/> the time when we <unk w="will"/> have the <unk w="real"/> impact on how that child <unk w="can"/> <unk w="carried"/> out through his or her youth and adulthood .
I would like <unk w="to"/> <unk w="ask"/> member to confirm that he brought this up in his speech but that <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> government plans no direct intervention in areas of provincial jurisdiction .
Even the Liberal red <unk w="group"/> <unk w="report"/> admits the act needs review .
<unk w="but"/> we have <unk w="a"/> political <unk w="will"/> or the courage to <unk w="be"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="to"/> the people of our country <unk w="who"/> have the right to <unk w="be"/> safe from people who would be behind bars if we took <unk w="on"/> proper action ?
[ Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier -- Montcalm ) : Mr. Speaker , I listened attentively to the hon. member 's speech <unk w="when"/> he said a few <unk w="points"/> that I do not agree <unk w="with"/> .
Mr. <unk w=","/> Gagnon ( <unk w="swedish"/> Secretary <unk w=")"/> Solicitor General of Canada ) : Mr. Speaker , I rise today to speak on the motion put before <unk w="the"/> House by the hon. member for Surrey -- White <unk w="paper"/> -- South Langley .
<unk w="it"/> is <unk w=","/> however that <unk w="the"/> members are not aware of the <unk w="work"/> being done , nor of the <unk w="reason"/> why we concentrate our efforts on these particular areas .
In 1991 , the costs <unk w="relating"/> to <unk w="the"/> police , court and correctional services reached a staggering $ 8 billion .
I <unk w="welcome"/> the <unk w="commission"/> <unk w="'s"/> commitment <unk w="to"/> work to improve public safety from high risk offenders and to improve <unk w="the"/> parole process <unk w="with"/> firm examples <unk w="of"/> <unk w="this"/> type of action that will put us on the right track <unk w="to"/> win back that <unk w="country"/> .
<unk w="according"/> to Standing <unk w="in"/> 30(5) , the House will now proceed to Statements by Members , pursuant to Standing Order <unk w=")"/> .
I want <unk w="to"/> remind <unk w="the"/> members of the words of <unk w="the"/> Luther King who said : `` I have a <unk w="view"/> that one day little black boys <unk w="and"/> black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and <unk w="other"/> girls and walk together as sisters and brothers .
<unk w="in"/> <unk w="in"/> <unk w=","/> Canada <unk w="'s"/> financial support to <unk w="the"/> construction <unk w="and"/> <unk w="management"/> of aluminum plants <unk w="in"/> South Africa and Russia while Canadian aluminum workers are being laid-off .
Mr. Preston <unk w="["/> ( <unk w="de"/> Southwest ) : Mr. Speaker , my <unk w="group"/> is for the Minister of Indian Affairs and <unk w="its"/> Development .
Will the Prime Minister tell us , yes or no , if <unk w="he"/> is preparing to <unk w="give"/> the GST to health care and medication , as some of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="honourable"/> members have hinted ?
[ Miss Deborah Grey ( Beaver River ) : Mr. Speaker , <unk w="and"/> on this <unk w="side"/> of the House are <unk w="calling"/> for generosity on behalf of cabinet ministers who are <unk w="an"/> inappropriate <unk w="and"/> .
Could the <unk w="commissioner"/> give us his <unk w="credit"/> <unk w=","/> he will do all he can to ensure that Walmart does <unk w="not"/> abandon these Canadian <unk w="legislation"/> where they can show they <unk w="are"/> <unk w="up"/> with the U.S. suppliers ?
I <unk w="take"/> the <unk w="commissioner"/> seriously enough that I <unk w="am"/> <unk w="to"/> warranted a direct call <unk w="for"/> Mr. Walton .
I will look <unk w="at"/> it and <unk w="go"/> back to <unk w="the"/> <unk w="honourable"/> member .
If the question of privilege by the member from Swift Current is <unk w="carried"/> out of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="time"/> period then I will hear a <unk w="lot"/> of privilege from the hon. member .
The Acting Speaker ( Mrs. Maheu ) : <unk w="the"/> hon. member for Saint-Hubert has seven minutes left .
Shortly after listening <unk w="at"/> the beginning <unk w="of"/> her <unk w="and"/> I began to <unk w="say"/> that she was not a newly elected member <unk w="and"/> she was running on with the rhetoric we have heard <unk w=","/> and over <unk w="the"/> various members who <unk w="have"/> <unk w="spoken"/> here <unk w="in"/> the past .
In <unk w="all"/> the hon. <unk w="we"/> did not hear , I will <unk w=","/> <unk w="what"/> I said , because <unk w="it"/> <unk w="have"/> <unk w="what"/> exactly I said : our <unk w="report"/> is flawed and <unk w="is"/> certainly <unk w="no"/> room <unk w="for"/> improvement .
I <unk w="think"/> <unk w="it"/> was an interesting proposal , <unk w="at"/> least that was my opinion , but that may not be what the hon. member heard .
[ Ms. Val Meredith ( Surrey -- White Rock -- <unk w="/"/> Langley ) : Madam Speaker , I listened <unk w="with"/> some <unk w="interest"/> to the first <unk w="question"/> of the hon. member <unk w="'"/> comments .
Surely a grave cause of concern in <unk w="the"/> area of victims of crime is <unk w="the"/> suffering caused <unk w="by"/> violence within our <unk w="continent"/> .
In the end we will be measured by <unk w="what"/> we accomplish , <unk w="but"/> by <unk w="what"/> we promise .
We as a community have done very well in Burlington on <unk w="top"/> of that .
I do not buy this perception and the encouragement of this <unk w="reason"/> that we are all at risk all the time .
<unk w="the"/> jury review must take <unk w="place"/> in the same province which means the inmate must <unk w="be"/> transported to <unk w="an"/> appropriate <unk w="way"/> .
<unk w="it"/> gives a convicted killer <unk w="the"/> right to apply for a reduction in his sentence in which a <unk w="country"/> reviews only selected <unk w="""/> --
When very serious acts <unk w="are"/> committed against individuals which <unk w="offer"/> them freedom to move and takes their lives in <unk w="individual"/> cases , then there must be an appropriate penalty .
I know I have a copy in my office and I have <unk w="the"/> major parts of it , but in the life of a <unk w="former"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="it"/> would be hard to read <unk w="the"/> entire <unk w="report"/> .
The fact that we have not addressed <unk w="it"/> as a nation and as a society is , I <unk w="agree"/> entirely with the mover of the motion , <unk w="so"/> that we <unk w="have"/> to deal with and we <unk w="have"/> to deal with soon .
A very well respected school principal came <unk w="to"/> <unk w=","/> for <unk w="a"/> boy , who had <unk w="worked"/> very well on intelligence <unk w="cooperation"/> , who had <unk w="had"/> a lot going for <unk w=","/> as <unk w="we"/> had a lot going <unk w="through"/> him .
[ Mr. <unk w="/"/> <unk w="]"/> ( Rosemont ) : Madam Speaker , I can only applaud what was said by the hon. <unk w=","/> for Halifax , <unk w="in"/> <unk w="and"/> concluding remarks on the issue of <unk w="budgetary"/> control .
I want to <unk w="respond"/> quickly <unk w="with"/> a newspaper article that appeared not <unk w="so"/> long ago <unk w="at"/> the <unk w="working"/> Times <unk w="in"/> my community :
I know as a victim <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> that happens is you feel like you have been <unk w="involved"/> .
I do not want to be <unk w="a"/> critical <unk w="of"/> the Reform Party .
<unk w="what"/> I need do is <unk w="to"/> <unk w="to"/> hon. member and the Reform Party <unk w="on"/> page 84 <unk w="of"/> the red <unk w="cross"/> where the Liberal Party set out its commitment <unk w="to"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="in"/> the election campaign with <unk w="regard"/> to the criminal justice system .
I <unk w="have"/> every confidence that <unk w="the"/> <unk w="court"/> of Justice will bring about significant change .
Section 745 as I indicated to the House <unk w="that"/> <unk w="it"/> allows individuals <unk w="aware"/> of first or second degree murder to <unk w="go"/> to a court <unk w="to"/> have their parole <unk w="and"/> dates brought forward .
Mr. Nunziata : Madam Speaker , there <unk w="is"/> no question that a balanced <unk w="solution"/> is <unk w="made"/> .
I agree with <unk w="the"/> hon. member <unk w="states"/> we must deal with the root causes of crime because in <unk w="the"/> long run that would be a <unk w="more"/> effective <unk w="way"/> of dealing with crime <unk w="in"/> our <unk w="citizens"/> .
The background relates to the procedures which <unk w="are"/> used by visitors who <unk w="wanted"/> to come to Canada , <unk w="apart"/> from what we call visa countries , <unk w="but"/> where it is necessary for residents to get visas from Canada <unk w="when"/> they visit here .
The only way an applicant can convince us that he or <unk w="it"/> is <unk w="not"/> a visitor <unk w=","/> by demonstrating that he or <unk w="has"/> <unk w="have"/> very strong ties to his or her home country <unk w=","/> will force him to return to that country .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> we have happening with resident Canadians is sometimes they will <unk w="go"/> to a lawyer or a notary <unk w="to"/> get a letter prepared that says : `` <unk w="his"/> brother , John , is <unk w="due"/> to visit and I will support him while he is here <unk w="today"/> .
The <unk w="few"/> visitors we have and the less restrictions there are on <unk w="them"/> , the <unk w="way"/> they are to spend <unk w="more"/> money and <unk w="their"/> revenue to Canadian businesses .
Having <unk w="had"/> this <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> my <unk w="colleagues"/> in the <unk w="last"/> <unk w="few"/> months in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="age"/> of commerce and various <unk w=","/> I have received only positive <unk w="response"/> .
So , <unk w="there"/> were <unk w="not"/> 5 out of $ 12 million spent in Quebec during Phase I <unk w="told"/> the <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> Lawrence Action Plan ?
I <unk w="welcome"/> the <unk w="ministry"/> of <unk w="the"/> Department of Industry to be <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
<unk w="as"/> being said , I think <unk w="that"/> the hon. member is taking a narrow view when he claims <unk w="to"/> , in the event of <unk w="any"/> problems , investments will <unk w="be"/> <unk w="be"/> distributed on a geographical basis .
Small <unk w="and"/> medium-sized businesses <unk w="are"/> complaining about <unk w="the"/> <unk w="financial"/> burden <unk w="and"/> see the need for <unk w="a"/> <unk w="avoid"/> duplication to be eliminated in governmental programs and services .
That <unk w="is"/> not what people are asking for in my riding .
I <unk w="go"/> back <unk w="to"/> these small forestry businesses , which as <unk w="you"/> know , Mr. Speaker , <unk w="who"/> scattered all across Quebec and Canada .
In my region , the per capita income is 25 per cent lower <unk w="than"/> the Quebec average .
It is unfortunate when business ventures fail through no fault of the individuals concerned , but it is outrageous when business failures <unk w="is"/> used <unk w="as"/> a <unk w="modern"/> <unk w="of"/> defrauding creditors , investors , employees and <unk w="consumers"/> .
<unk w="the"/> Monique Guay ( Laurentides ) : Mr. Speaker , <unk w="on"/> the <unk w="most"/> recent annual report of the Canadian Human Rights Commission , its president , Mr. Yalden , was <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
New <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> orders for durable goods showed a 2.7 per cent increase , the highest <unk w="of"/> 1988 , <unk w="and"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> retooling of the <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> plants .
If the hon. <unk w="union"/> wants <unk w="to"/> <unk w="improve"/> the ethical behaviour <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="ministry"/> of Finance , he should note <unk w=","/> in <unk w="particular"/> , the minister was the first <unk w="time"/> to disclose the full extent of his <unk w="family"/> holdings <unk w="in"/> all Canadians .
<unk w="the"/> Indian Act was <unk w="only"/> approximately 75 years before the <unk w="swedish"/> Prime <unk w="minister"/> came <unk w="to"/> the House of <unk w="it"/> .
We will be introducing some very specific changes , but to suggest that the <unk w="whole"/> of Canada is going to <unk w="reduce"/> its financial problems by a review of the pension <unk w="system"/> for 295 <unk w=","/> is not a <unk w="direct"/> reflection of the fact that our financial <unk w="resources"/> <unk w="is"/> much more significant .
Obviously we <unk w="are"/> dealing <unk w="with"/> some very difficult issues .
Hon. Diane Marleau ( Minister <unk w="of"/> Health ) : Mr. Speaker , I am aware of the incident that the hon. member has brought up .
This is an excellent example of co-operation <unk w="between"/> our two departments .
My understanding <unk w="is"/> that the three reports tabled here at noon are aimed at finding the best solution to get rid of <unk w="this"/> danger .
It is fine and <unk w="difficult"/> to hold public hearings , but if they lead to <unk w="the"/> conclusions <unk w="of"/> the ones <unk w="in"/> the report , does that <unk w="ensure"/> that the latter are skewed and that we must start all over <unk w="it"/> ?
True , <unk w="the"/> Irving <unk w="it"/> has been <unk w="given"/> off the islands for <unk w="many"/> days , but let us not forget that , of these 8,593 days , 3,450 were spent <unk w="by"/> the Conservatives and 5,308 <unk w="from"/> the Liberals .
<unk w="it"/> has <unk w="been"/> a <unk w="large"/> part of the operations <unk w="in"/> provincial <unk w="terrorism"/> , a <unk w="former"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> of municipal governments to borrow millions and even billions of dollars .
We borrow to pay interest on <unk w="what"/> we borrowed yesterday .
<unk w="very"/> shortly , and we will have a <unk w="debate"/> on this , <unk w="and"/> it will <unk w="not"/> be <unk w="possible"/> <unk w="to"/> the value of the pensions of former <unk w="secretary-general"/> of <unk w="oil"/> will exceed the total amount of <unk w="money"/> <unk w="of"/> Canadian taxpayers <unk w="'"/> spending on current members of Parliament .
Let me <unk w="say"/> <unk w="that"/> the scepticism as both a <unk w="lawyer"/> and an economist <unk w="and"/> I <unk w="talk"/> about deficits today achieving lower deficits tomorrow <unk w=","/> in particular an interim target <unk w="of"/> 3 per cent of GDP .
On February 1 and 2 <unk w="we"/> hit basically a trough not <unk w="only"/> in a long time in interest rates in this country .
Because of that I <unk w="am"/> going to take a few minutes to outline some of the technical <unk w="details"/> of the bill .
That is how we reached the total borrowing authority <unk w="of"/> $ 34.3 billion , which the <unk w="commission"/> will note <unk w="quite"/> different from the budgetary deficit .
We have heard over a dozen intelligent business people from many <unk w="parts"/> of the country <unk w=","/> <unk w="which"/> all of us have <unk w="talked"/> about the difficulties of small business .
<unk w="in"/> the <unk w="end"/> of June we will be <unk w="able"/> to bring solid , constructive recommendations to Parliament and to the Minister of Finance , recommendations for amendment in terms of regulation and <unk w="measures"/> for banks to <unk w="continue"/> their process and <unk w="work"/> .
I tell them <unk w="not"/> to be shy <unk w="in"/> <unk w="for"/> their constituents <unk w="and"/> some of the good things the government <unk w="is"/> doing .
<unk w="all"/> these airplanes costs almost $ 20,000 an hour .
<unk w="however"/> <unk w="the"/> hon. member know where the <unk w="is"/> are <unk w="concerned"/> ?
<unk w="however"/> , in the opinion of this House , the government should <unk w="participate"/> in legislation limiting solely to individuals the right to donate <unk w="in"/> a federal political party , and restricting such donations to a <unk w="series"/> of $ 5,000 a year .
The commission took the view -- and I <unk w="think"/> it was a correct <unk w="and"/> good view -- that transparency in the process would make up <unk w="to"/> the <unk w="end"/> of a limit because the limits can <unk w="be"/> got around <unk w="for"/> too <unk w="long"/> .
No one is <unk w="going"/> to tell me that my <unk w="colleagues"/> who are making $ 20,000 or $ 25,000 a <unk w="lawyer"/> , who come <unk w="from"/> my <unk w="own"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> and give me $ 100 are doing <unk w="everything"/> to get something <unk w="about"/> <unk w="about"/> .
There is also the whole issue <unk w="of"/> the application <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="directive"/> to this kind <unk w="of"/> limitation .
This motion means the end <unk w="of"/> secret election funds and of influence peddling and the beginning of <unk w="a"/> democracy .
I asked someone to follow up and <unk w="not"/> enough <unk w="that"/> <unk w="we"/> have qualified for <unk w="them"/> .
It took the <unk w="responsibility"/> of the hon. member <unk w="to"/> help a senior citizen <unk w="and"/> that she <unk w="is"/> entitled to receive an income supplement .
I understand details are going to have be worked out and there will have <unk w="been"/> <unk w="been"/> some <unk w="time"/> <unk w="and"/> so on so as not to <unk w="do"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> kind of <unk w="information"/> that <unk w="my"/> friend in the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="parliament"/> has brought forward .
( <unk w="at"/> 11.39 a.m. , the sitting of the <unk w="council"/> was <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> . )
Section 51 <unk w="of"/> the Constitution Act <unk w="and"/> <unk w=","/> after each decennial census <unk w="and"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> the formula for determining the number of seats <unk w="in"/> province .
There is a very <unk w="good"/> chance , if we can <unk w="to"/> <unk w="in"/> a sense of what <unk w="extent"/> it is <unk w="a"/> party <unk w="and"/> actually <unk w="when"/> we change about this <unk w="issue"/> , that we may get a better act or <unk w="national"/> boundaries .
<unk w="i"/> have received no <unk w="congratulations"/> <unk w="from"/> <unk w="the"/> government that three party agreement will be necessary to <unk w="establish"/> a new boundaries <unk w="and"/> <unk w="it"/> .
We established the commissions last fall with the intention that they would come forward , as they have done before , <unk w="making"/> proposals based <unk w="on"/> <unk w="similarly"/> , rational opinions as to why boundaries should be the way they <unk w="are"/> proposing .
The public would end up with the short end of the stick where the hearing process is short-circuited and the <unk w="european"/> <unk w=","/> are independent and impartial have <unk w="been"/> told that their work is <unk w="being"/> <unk w="done"/> .
I am somewhat shocked <unk w="by"/> some of the things I heard .
There is probably a fairly clear <unk w="example"/> <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="people"/> of Canada do not <unk w="have"/> these Chambers <unk w="and"/> to continue to mushroom census <unk w="and"/> <unk w=","/> until we get -- I do not <unk w="know"/> what <unk w="the"/> limit would be -- hundreds and hundreds of members of Parliament .
<unk w="as"/> <unk w="have"/> all heard from <unk w="my"/> constituents that this at <unk w="present"/> <unk w="can"/> be something that <unk w="we"/> would move on very cautiously <unk w="and"/> perhaps we ought not to move <unk w="the"/> <unk w="it"/> at <unk w="any"/> other than simply cap it with <unk w="the"/> present levels for now .
<unk w="the"/> Karen Kraft <unk w="report"/> ( York -- Simcoe ) : Mr. Speaker , Hyundai Auto Canada has recently made a corporate decision <unk w="in"/> close <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> wheel plant <unk w=","/> <unk w="and"/> , Ontario .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> cost <unk w="to"/> the Canadian taxpayer that I have seen <unk w=","/> this is about $ <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> billion .
[ <unk w="mr"/> Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance and Minister <unk w=","/> for the Federal Office <unk w="of"/> Regional Development <unk w="("/> <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> ) : Mr. Speaker , <unk w="it"/> would certainly be the objective of our government and of the Government of Quebec .
[ Mr. Herb Grubel ( Capilano <unk w=")"/> Howe Sound ) : Mr. Speaker , it is well <unk w="done"/> by the media that this contract is up for renewal as <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> <unk w="in"/> 1 .
<unk w="but"/> I want to assure the member that were a Canadian company involved it would be <unk w="an"/> instinct to name such a <unk w="few"/> <unk w=","/> to bring the entire shame <unk w="of"/> anger of the nation <unk w="states"/> on that kind of <unk w="approach"/> .
One of the things that is <unk w="the"/> right now is an <unk w="illusion"/> under the auspices of Judge Krever .
Given that and because of the representations made we certainly have no intention <unk w="of"/> reinstituting any kind of <unk w="a"/> <unk w="or"/> tax <unk w="on"/> ethanol .
<unk w="let"/> me today <unk w="in"/> <unk w="this"/> House , at <unk w="the"/> first opportunity I have had since the beginning of this Semaine de la Francophonie , to remind <unk w="you"/> of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="the"/> facts .
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon ( <unk w="applause"/> ) : Mr. Speaker , today it is a great honour and a great source of <unk w="sympathy"/> <unk w="to"/> the Bloc Quebecois to draw the attention of <unk w="the"/> House to la Journée <unk w="and"/> <unk/> la Francophonie .
We must <unk w="remember"/> that the destiny <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="it"/> should <unk w="not"/> be <unk w="excluded"/> from <unk w="the"/> affirmation of Quebec <unk w="and"/> <unk w="policy"/> , because <unk w="the"/> community owes its <unk w="right"/> to <unk w="be"/> <unk w="us"/> to endure as a people .
The closing of Collège militaire in <unk w="has"/> <unk/> brought up the case of the French <unk w="plant"/> <unk/> in Kingston , <unk w="is"/> <unk/> located in a building without washrooms <unk w="a"/> <unk/> water .
<unk w="if"/> we are at the very last <unk w="minute"/> <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="coming"/> out from under this process and not allowing <unk w="the"/> citizens of <unk w="the"/> country to help us move in better <unk w=","/> if we are agreed <unk w="that"/> we <unk w="are"/> <unk w="in"/> <unk w="two"/> directions .
Whatever we do in <unk w="this"/> House or <unk w="if"/> the <unk w="commission"/> does to affect the process must <unk w="be"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> integrity <unk w="and"/> <unk w="this"/> process rather than <unk w="a"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> to even a suspicion that there can be partisan tinkering with it .
We <unk w="have"/> urged citizens there to make their proposals known .
<unk w="but"/> it is true that the people of Canada do not want to see an increase in the number <unk w="of"/> members of the House , the number of members representing and governing <unk w="parliament"/> , we ought to <unk w="give"/> them an <unk w="opportunity"/> to <unk w="achieve"/> this concern .
I think that would be the <unk w="case"/> that <unk w="we"/> should <unk w="apply"/> to the public rather than simply using our <unk w="own"/> unilateral judgment to put a <unk w="stop"/> to <unk w="the"/> exercise of the commission 's <unk w="proposal"/> .
It is clear that <unk w="there"/> is a lot of unhappiness both in <unk w="view"/> of the growing <unk w="number"/> of <unk w="countries"/> that have <unk w="been"/> suggested and in terms of the violation of community and sense of cohesion that has been built up <unk w="in"/> <unk w="all"/> areas <unk w="of"/> political <unk w="significance"/> .
I <unk w="would"/> say <unk w="in"/> <unk w="mr"/> hon. <unk w="is"/> that for <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> I <unk w="would"/> urge him to <unk w="support"/> the amendment we <unk w="have"/> made to <unk w="the"/> a period of time so that those <unk w="other"/> specific directions can <unk w="be"/> built into the bill and <unk w="that"/> the bill can be brought <unk w="about"/> .
The hon. <unk w="seas"/> for Calgary North and I <unk w="hope"/> other members of the <unk w="european"/> <unk w=","/> from Calgary have been <unk w="passed"/> on a submission <unk w="to"/> be made to the <unk w="commission"/> hearings in <unk w="tampere"/> on April 20 .
It <unk w="will"/> raise the <unk w="issue"/> <unk w="as"/> to how serious the government is about <unk w="whether"/> or <unk w="does"/> not to increase the <unk w="number"/> of members .
Rather than just taking a chance on a proper proposal or a <unk w="rather"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="assessment"/> of a <unk w="long"/> process , it <unk w="is"/> <unk w="so"/> far better to make that <unk w="the"/> right <unk w="in"/> front as a condition of going in a <unk w="new"/> direction with the process rather than hoping that somehow it comes out of talks within the House or committees in the next few months .
<unk w="we"/> are calling for the government to adopt a <unk w="position"/> that <unk w="has"/> <unk w="been"/> accused of being partisan .
<unk w="at"/> this time <unk w="there"/> are so far in <unk w="future"/> , we should <unk w="be"/> looking at <unk w="the"/> ways to reduce costs <unk w="and"/> restricting the increase in the size of all our governing bodies , not <unk w="reducing"/> our debts .
It is a real incentive for me to run in <unk w="my"/> constituency of Portage ; <unk w="i"/> <unk w="believe"/> that I <unk w="wanted"/> to defeat another federal minister .
This would <unk w="make"/> the second political interference in <unk w="the"/> process <unk w="is"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
The majority of people in my riding of Lisgar -- Marquette <unk w=","/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="of"/> people and they are very interested in keeping that name and there will <unk w="be"/> a number of recommendations to this commission on that <unk w="matter"/> , the preservation of the name Lisgar .
I can understand the first blush reaction of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="report"/> .
I am sure that the committee <unk w="has"/> to <unk w="adopt"/> <unk w="this"/> legislation will make <unk w="available"/> to the House , which will <unk w="support"/> these proposals before it decides to <unk w="implement"/> them .
I <unk w="hope"/> that <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> government <unk w="should"/> be fighting for its <unk w="continued"/> existence in 1997 , and then who knows ?
It makes one wonder about the Reform Party 's platform on referendums , <unk w="such"/> initiatives and free <unk w="trade"/> , does it <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> ?
The various reasons that are being <unk w="discussed"/> , <unk w="both"/> in this <unk w="way"/> but sort of in the hallways , <unk w="without"/> stopping this <unk w="is"/> <unk w="is"/> a complete contradiction <unk w="with"/> <unk w="each"/> other in terms of the <unk w="extent"/> that they would bring about .
These commissions consist of three <unk w="words"/> : a chairman who <unk w="was"/> appointed <unk w="by"/> the <unk w="criminal"/> justice of the <unk w="spanish"/> <unk w="and"/> among judges in <unk w="the"/> province <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="former"/> two members of the commission are appointed by the Speaker of <unk w="the"/> House .
They are <unk w="still"/> more <unk w="closely"/> with that process than with a committee of politicians deciding <unk w="that"/> where boundaries should or <unk w="should"/> not be .
I <unk w="am"/> <unk w="agree"/> with her and Canadians would agree with <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> very point that the process as <unk w="it"/> now exists is separate from <unk w="the"/> rather than <unk w="the"/> politicians .
[ Mr. Werner Schmidt ( Okanagan Centre ) : <unk w="every"/> Speaker , are <unk w="of"/> <unk w="all"/> kinds of things that happened in the boundary changes of the member for Edmonton -- Strathcona happening in <unk w="the"/> Centre ?
<unk w="the"/> Hanrahan : Mr. Speaker , in terms of Edmonton -- Strathcona it is geographically <unk w=","/> in south central Edmonton .
I have a method in place <unk w="to"/> go and voice <unk w="their"/> concerns <unk w="all"/> my complaints <unk w="about"/> that .
That <unk w="has"/> to go and talk to the people at the public hearings .
I would like <unk w="to"/> invite the commissioners who sit as the Alberta commissioners , <unk w="apart"/> from Calgary , one from Edmonton , <unk w="to"/> come <unk w="and"/> spend a week with me in <unk w="the"/> River , in <unk w="the"/> four <unk w="or"/> four .
They do have something in <unk w="line"/> with urban and rural <unk w="areas"/> .
One does not make a matter worse <unk w="than"/> having the government and the Official <unk w="federations"/> jump up and say <unk w="that"/> we should shelve it , that we should try to come <unk w="up"/> with something better .
Also , I <unk w="urge"/> the minister to set up a strategy <unk w="for"/> a <unk w="strategy"/> for examining the <unk w="situation"/> <unk w="of"/> reducing or eliminating other <unk w="types"/> of chlorine and other <unk w="highly"/> toxic substances .
I wish to underline the importance <unk w="of"/> an open public process in which all the players , including the public , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
I could envisage working <unk w="together"/> closely <unk w="on"/> the <unk w="parties"/> involved , including the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , the bureaucrats in that department <unk w=","/> <unk w="in"/> the committee , <unk w="to"/> work together on a co-operative basis to <unk w="adopt"/> a position <unk w="on"/> what is <unk w="in"/> the public <unk w="interest"/> .
First , the information highway will be a cornerstone for <unk w="the"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="of"/> economic growth .
In this report , our committee recommends that it <unk w="is"/> authorized <unk w="to"/> act as advisor to <unk w="the"/> speakers of the Senate and of the House of Commons when they exercise their authority over the Library .
A report has been prepared assessing the reasons for the <unk w="national"/> insurance <unk w="package"/> and recommending measures to reverse the trend .
<unk w="this"/> is <unk w="also"/> the ability to look at a <unk w="directive"/> and to <unk w="innovative"/> approaches with <unk w="guinea"/> at <unk w="the"/> grass roots .
The latest figures show 1,559,000 <unk w="""/> people .
However , I wanted to say that I <unk w="am"/> <unk w="that"/> I did <unk w="not"/> check <unk w=","/> <unk w="what"/> I have left , I will be quick , I could <unk w="have"/> asked you <unk w="for"/> continuing -- with <unk w="the"/> <unk w="young"/> people in the Quebec forum on social solidarity .
What I want to say <unk w="is"/> <unk w="is"/> : There has <unk w="been"/> , <unk w="at"/> least in Quebec , <unk w="not"/> because the unemployment problem there has been <unk w=","/> for a long time , a change in <unk w="practice"/> .
We also <unk w="welcome"/> the brighter futures <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , <unk w="it"/> is a carryover <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="process"/> .
Just remember <unk w="what"/> happened when Ms. Campbell <unk w="is"/> , <unk w="in"/> a debate , that the unemployment rate <unk w="can"/> stand at 9 per cent at the <unk w="centre"/> of the <unk w="disease"/> .
It would make more sense <unk w="if"/> we gave this amount <unk w="in"/> a region in particular , to a <unk w="large"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="of"/> credit unions in the south-western part <unk w="in"/> Montreal for <unk w="it"/> .
<unk w="we"/> have university students with diplomas clutched <unk w="in"/> <unk w="their"/> hands applying for jobs at McDonald's .
My wife would be delighted if I told her that I have decided not to buy a new luxury <unk w="product"/> .
Instead of borrowing <unk w="fuel"/> helicopters , we are <unk w="responsible"/> for the <unk w="fact"/> that I have listed .
Could he just <unk w="say"/> on what he has against equality .
The government is pulling <unk w="total"/> and more money out of the <unk w="interests"/> of individuals , <unk w="consumers"/> and business people just to <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> debt that <unk w="is"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
<unk w="i"/> <unk w="in"/> my belief that to <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> the economy and to increase revenues <unk w="in"/> government , lenders , investors and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="to"/> possess a <unk w="new"/> pool of disposable income .
It generates real revenue and <unk w="that"/> a message <unk w="to"/> investors and <unk w="above"/> all <unk w="know"/> that <unk w="the"/> country wants a future based <unk w="on"/> prosperity not <unk w="the"/> government handouts and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="it"/> .
The <unk w="availability"/> of basic infrastructure has <unk w="always"/> been <unk w="the"/> responsibility of governments <unk w="which"/> leads one to <unk w="them"/> : <unk w="what"/> have they been doing <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="same"/> <unk w="up"/> to 30 <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> about such negligence with regard to <unk w="their"/> basic responsibility ?
I want to tell the member that we have not <unk w="had"/> any concrete <unk w="proposals"/> from that side except <unk w="for"/> things like CMHC .
With respect to the fact that the government 's budget in this <unk w="case"/> <unk w=","/> is <unk w="a"/> thought <unk w=","/> and well planned and that it is going to take action , I would <unk w="like"/> to debate <unk w="this"/> .
<unk w="all"/> of this <unk w="reason"/> , Canada still has to pay a risk premium on the money it borrows <unk w="now"/> .
The monetary policy of the Bank of Canada is praised even though it <unk w="is"/> <unk w="not"/> for the fact that the <unk w="interview"/> was <unk w="growing"/> in Canada than in the United States .
These are the <unk w="people"/> who for <unk w="this"/> <unk w="we"/> have <unk w="been"/> asking <unk w="the"/> national <unk w="parliaments"/> to take the leadership to bring all three <unk w="heads"/> of government together to rebuild <unk w="their"/> infrastructure <unk w="in"/> Canada .
A <unk w="great"/> deal of the initial $ 2 billion <unk w=","/> we have <unk w="and"/> will <unk w="be"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="to"/> the government and to the people <unk w="of"/> Canada through the <unk w="interests"/> of <unk w="the"/> people <unk w="who"/> are now working on this program instead of being unemployed .
<unk w="at"/> the time <unk w="comes"/> , approximately five minutes to the <unk w="commission"/> <unk w="summit"/> , I would like to <unk w="ask"/> two members who are seeking the floor .
This is not a time for that kind of <unk w="freedom"/> of spirit , that <unk w="is"/> to <unk w="say"/> , that attempt to <unk w="protect"/> people 's deep concerns for immediate partisan advantage .
I must say when I listen to members of <unk w="the"/> Reform Party or <unk w="the"/> member for Mercier say <unk w="it"/> is a waste of money it seems to me those members do not really quite understand what it is <unk w="all"/> about .
That is <unk w="why"/> <unk w="when"/> we invited the participation of members opposite even though they now <unk w="wish"/> to participate .
Many <unk w="young"/> people no <unk w="longer"/> fit into the school structure ; they drop out .
The only people absent from the debate , <unk w="the"/> only people who seem to be withholding their participation , <unk w="the"/> members of the opposition .
The fundamental <unk w="problem"/> <unk w="is"/> that we <unk w="should"/> have <unk w="responsibility"/> for Canadians a sense of hope <unk w="and"/> opportunity that <unk w="will"/> , their families and their kids can go back to work .
Let <unk w="us"/> not bring <unk w="about"/> the <unk w="time"/> and mirrors again and call it job creation because it does not <unk w="hinder"/> jobs .
Even if the roof of this building opened up and that money dropped in and it was spent without increasing the deficit , we would <unk w="also"/> have <unk w="more"/> jobs at the <unk w="end"/> of that year when <unk w="the"/> money <unk w="is"/> spent .
<unk w="so"/> I think <unk w=","/> <unk w="president"/> , sir , deserves <unk w="the"/> length of answer .
<unk w="we"/> intend to continue and to raise the issue of fundamental freedoms at the same time .
We as a country are heavily indebted at the <unk w="very"/> <unk w="of"/> provincial <unk w=","/> and it is going require co-operation with the <unk w="commission"/> which we have already <unk w="mentioned"/> , <unk w="and"/> that is true .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w="prime"/> minister , who has failed miserably in his first test as the defender of Canada <unk w="and"/> cultural heritage , <unk w="i"/> believe <unk w="that"/> he <unk w="is"/> <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="personal"/> opinion to show that he is really above <unk w="all"/> on this ?
We certainly will take the hon. member 's comments <unk w="into"/> consideration and come to a <unk w="debate"/> .
I am now able to report <unk w="that"/> officials have informed me that <unk w="the"/> results and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="have"/> <unk w="so"/> that minivans offer a level of passenger safety <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> that of other passenger vehicles .
Clearly this <unk w="time"/> has to come from the taxpayers and since the federal and <unk w="eu"/> governments are running deficits , obviously it has <unk w="to"/> be borrowed .
The <unk w="eu"/> <unk w="of"/> North Vancouver have <unk w="to"/> carry their share of the debt burden for this program so <unk w="it"/> <unk w="the"/> only <unk w="means"/> that <unk w="they"/> take their share of it as <unk w="well"/> .
However , let me <unk w="say"/> what is like <unk w="to"/> be in a <unk w="way"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="in"/> which everything is so <unk w="much"/> <unk w="and"/> one does not get the choice of raising <unk w="and"/> <unk w="in"/> the same <unk w="way"/> that the government can raise <unk w="it"/> .
[ Mr. Alex Shepherd ( Durham ) : <unk w="previous"/> Speaker , I would like to <unk w="thank"/> my hon. colleague for <unk w="her"/> speech <unk w="and"/> assure him that I <unk w="am"/> <unk w="that"/> the small business sector as well .
In the great riding of Halton -- <unk w=","/> I have had <unk w="to"/> <unk w="to"/> the municipalities which say that the choices <unk w="they"/> <unk w="be"/> made for <unk w="the"/> renewal <unk w="would"/> have a spin-off effect in those municipalities <unk w="over"/> the next 10 <unk w="or"/> 15 years .
In <unk w="the"/> opposition <unk w="the"/> document of last fall there were <unk w="only"/> two fleeting <unk w="relating"/> to unemployment and both related <unk w="to"/> <unk w="globalisation"/> or current events .
I would like to give a <unk w="few"/> <unk w="a"/> lesson , going back to the 17th <unk w=","/> when people <unk w="do"/> not understand <unk w="the"/> concept of unemployment , when people worked seven days a week and basically dropped dead <unk w="undeclared"/> work .
It does not have any , just crumbs <unk w="they"/> do not allow for <unk w="further"/> development .
I regret , Madam Speaker , but I must say that it <unk w="is"/> <unk w="important"/> for the government to <unk w="come"/> up with such a <unk w="measure"/> , claiming it is <unk w="important"/> to create jobs , and nothing <unk w="else"/> .
The government <unk w="believes"/> that the <unk w="question"/> <unk w="hand"/> hand is as simple <unk w="as"/> <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="same"/> <unk w=","/> as difficult as <unk w="to"/> the economy back on <unk w="the"/> <unk w="market"/> to growth , because <unk w="the"/> solution to our <unk w="problems"/> <unk w=","/> just that , growth .
It is the area of <unk w="a"/> potential for restoring growth in the economy <unk w="in"/> the 1990s .
Well planned spending on this new <unk w="and"/> <unk w="of"/> infrastructure offers the potential for immediate <unk w="job"/> creation in the short term , <unk w="and"/> it is <unk w="not"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
I come <unk w="from"/> it from <unk w="another"/> angle that government does not <unk w="hinder"/> jobs .
Of course as a community we often <unk w="have"/> and <unk w="can"/> talk about the various <unk w="countries"/> <unk w="we"/> face in <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> and the various things <unk w="which"/> hinder or help us .
If <unk w="it"/> had been a good business <unk w=","/> I suggest <unk w="that"/> <unk w="you"/> , Madam Speaker , that he would not have had the problem in coming <unk w="up"/> with the <unk w="commission"/> .
That is something that small <unk w="companies"/> right across <unk w="the"/> <unk w="country"/> to <unk w="us"/> all the <unk w="citizens"/> <unk w="and"/> it is something that we in government -- and I include myself now <unk w=","/> I <unk w="have"/> <unk w="a"/> part of the <unk w="treaty"/> as it were -- all too often fail to recognize .
The House divided on the motion which was agreed <unk w="unanimously"/> on the following division :
The amount must be paid or received as support payment or <unk w="any"/> type of <unk w="training"/> .
The alimony or allowance must be payable regularly ; the spouses or former spouses must be <unk w="accompanied"/> by <unk w="means"/> of a <unk w="clear"/> , legal separation <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> separation agreement .
It <unk w="is"/> obvious that single parent women -- and I am <unk w="sure"/> my time is running out -- are particularly vulnerable <unk w="groups"/> , and we <unk w="must"/> turn <unk w="the"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="to"/> some extent by providing for a tax <unk w=","/> that would meet their <unk w="requirements"/> .
This issue should be discussed in the House and all its <unk w="own"/> problems and solutions pointed out .
First , the <unk w="commission"/> <unk w="directive"/> is that support recipients <unk w="of"/> the money without <unk w="additional"/> taxes .
I would like to take <unk w="the"/> opportunity <unk w="to"/> <unk w="thank"/> the hon. member for <unk w="calling"/> for bringing forward this issue to the House of <unk w="tomorrow"/> .
The <unk w="end"/> result is that lone parents accounted for 20 <unk w="and"/> <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> of all families in <unk w="the"/> year 1991 , up from 17 per cent in <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> .
Hon. Charles Caccia ( <unk w="applause"/> ) : Mr. Speaker , <unk w="it"/> means a richness of <unk w="work"/> as it surrounds us in nature .
Considering <unk w="that"/> the aim of the <unk w="european"/> Languages Act <unk w="both"/> by the Liberal Party was to give francophones their rightful place in the <unk w="irish"/> economy , the only <unk w="way"/> <unk w="that"/> can <unk w="be"/> drawn <unk w="out"/> that the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="is"/> <unk w="is"/> a failure .
He <unk w="said"/> that governments have a <unk w="different"/> habit <unk w="of"/> seriously overestimating <unk w="the"/> growth <unk w="and"/> tax revenues .
We think this <unk w="is"/> a <unk w="truly"/> innovative approach and <unk w="to"/> provide additional help to the many deserving students <unk w="who"/> want to go back to school and get good training for their <unk w="families"/> .
Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of <unk w="justice"/> and <unk w="the"/> ) : <unk w="last"/> Speaker , I thank the <unk w="honourable"/> member for asking <unk w="the"/> first question <unk w="to"/> the <unk w="commission"/> .
I would ask the <unk w="honourable"/> member to consider putting this type of question on the Order Paper .
Mr. Ted <unk w="["/> ( Vancouver Quadra ) : Mr. Speaker , I <unk w="welcome"/> the remarks of the hon. member for Saint-Hubert and the hon. member for Beaver River <unk w="and"/> the gracious tribute they have paid to our parliamentarian Librarian Emeritus .
I would have <unk w="been"/> able to support this bill to temporarily borrow funds <unk w="or"/> reduced levels of spending .
They bought it with overly generous social <unk w="transactions"/> ; not overly generous <unk w="but"/> <unk w=","/> in need , overly generous for those <unk w="of"/> <unk w="we"/> need .
<unk w="it"/> is in the question <unk w="of"/> the manner in which <unk w="we"/> will <unk w="be"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
The idea of the <unk w="digital"/> age pension <unk w=","/> which I <unk w="think"/> was <unk w="told"/> that <unk w="you"/> brought in <unk w="the"/> aid people who had a problem in sustaining a reasonable standard of living in their <unk w="old"/> age .
Is <unk w="it"/> a bill <unk w="that"/> will give <unk w="the"/> reason <unk w="for"/> <unk w="move"/> and <unk w="move"/> forward to a <unk w="peaceful"/> and prosperous future for all Canadians and Quebecers ?
That is a lot of money , and <unk w="how"/> many people can <unk w="do"/> what this amount represents .
<unk w="not"/> only would we be able to pave the highway from the <unk w="eu"/> to the Pacific , we could go all the way <unk w="open"/> to the Atlantic and travel an additional <unk w="thousand"/> kilometres in the opposite direction .
When I see it is not , I wonder why I should not give my <unk w="opinion"/> directly to the <unk w="extent"/> that has proven in the <unk w="future"/> to be more able to <unk w="take"/> care of my finances .
This is the question I would like the hon. member <unk w="of"/> <unk w="parliament"/> .
<unk w="in"/> fact <unk w=","/> it collects $ 120 billion in taxes and $ <unk w="a"/> billion goes to pay interest on <unk w="the"/> debt .
I guess they are all important , <unk w="but"/> to <unk w="which"/> it is a side issue , whether it affects agriculture per se or <unk w="in"/> one <unk w="side"/> of the <unk w="little"/> more than another .
<unk w="the"/> jet fuel taxes are being rolled back <unk w="per"/> cent to four <unk w="or"/> a <unk w="year"/> .
How many times have we heard small and medium sized businesses <unk w="and"/> that <unk w="when"/> they ask <unk w="the"/> government is to <unk w="find"/> out of their way and get off their backs so they can get on <unk w="to"/> the <unk w="way"/> that <unk w="we"/> do best which is create jobs for Canadians ?
Regardless of what it was , if an <unk w="agreement"/> is missed at the start of a parliament to <unk w="review"/> the tone for what the government is trying <unk w="to"/> accomplish the <unk w="country"/> <unk w="will"/> never come back .
The finance minister brought in a budget that increased overall <unk w="of"/> <unk w="of"/> $ 3 billion .
That would be tantamount to opening Pandora 's <unk w="market"/> .
There <unk w="is"/> the <unk w="problems"/> and debates <unk w="on"/> immigration , over the <unk w="past"/> and what Quebec 's <unk w="report"/> <unk w="will"/> be , how we do this , how we do that .
The <unk w="first"/> Speaker : All those <unk w="who"/> will please say nay .
At the federal level , the <unk w="need"/> to do so is <unk w="borne"/> by the houses of the federal parliament , <unk w="but"/> at the provincial level , it is made by the members of the <unk w="commission"/> .
The US constitution does not contain <unk w="any"/> and the legislator <unk w="is"/> bound by his own constitutional provisions which must be upheld .
Mr. Ian McClelland ( Edmonton Southwest ) : Yes , Mr. Speaker , I will share my <unk w="view"/> .
I do not know what that compromise would <unk w="happen"/> , but I know <unk w="that"/> people of <unk w="europe"/> , at least in my <unk w="opinion"/> , would far <unk w="to"/> have a country where elected bodies <unk w="and"/> <unk w="the"/> nation were <unk w="not"/> to <unk w="the"/> judicial bodies .
Mr. Speaker , this is <unk w="not"/> a negotiable issue as <unk w="far"/> as we are concerned .
There are certainly some reflections of that idea <unk w="of"/> there but it is <unk w="more"/> than that .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> hon. member has indicated what the facts of the situation <unk w="and"/> -- I suggest that nothing at all <unk w="can"/> be gained by having a <unk w="duty"/> , either in the House or in a committee , on the matter raised by the hon. member for High Park -- Humber Valley .
The national historic sites and <unk w="cultural"/> heritage <unk w="will"/> go a long way toward filling this knowledge gap .
It should be pointed out <unk w="that"/> , <unk w="especially"/> on the <unk w="basis"/> of sustainable development , economic <unk w="policy"/> <unk w="must"/> be compatible with <unk w="the"/> long-term <unk w="effects"/> of unmanaged ecosystems and survival processes .
His successor only <unk w="wishes"/> to follow in his footsteps .
Motion agreed to on division : Yeas , 140 ; Nays , <unk w="etc"/>
That is all <unk w="well"/> and fine , but <unk w="we"/> need to <unk w="make"/> <unk w="a"/> distinction in the House that <unk w="there"/> could be one reason <unk w="why"/> <unk w="it"/> is trying to ram <unk w="a"/> bill through <unk w="very"/> quickly , because he stands to lose his <unk w="interest"/> .
That is why I think it is more <unk w="difficult"/> for someone in this party who stands to lose a constituency <unk w="and"/> to <unk w="do"/> so self-serving as to say : `` Yes , let us put the whole process off '' .
They will be able to <unk w="safeguard"/> some of <unk w="their"/> constituents to be witnesses and over a <unk w="year"/> <unk w="that"/> we will come up with something better .
The suggestion has been made <unk w="by"/> the bill <unk w="that"/> the government came through the <unk w="official"/> rooms <unk w="of"/> the Liberal caucus , <unk w="but"/> it did not <unk w="in"/> the light of day with constituents , that some <unk w="of"/> it was all politically manipulated .
Thank goodness it <unk w="has"/> finally asserted itself over the issue of federal electoral redistribution .
We <unk w="do"/> not pretend to be holier than the average citizen .
If we continue with the <unk w="situation"/> in the longer term we are <unk w="going"/> to keep adding members to the House of <unk w="tomorrow"/> .
My wish and my hope is that we will come up <unk w="with"/> a <unk w="sector"/> that is a great <unk w="deal"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> one we presently have .
We can possibly <unk w="end"/> up with a plan saying <unk w=","/> for whatever constitutional consideration and to recognize some of those <unk w="countries"/> <unk w="who"/> are going <unk w="to"/> cap <unk w="the"/> <unk w="members"/> of <unk w="the"/> House of Commons at , let us <unk w="hope"/> , 300 members .
Two or three <unk w="of"/> <unk w="states"/> did people <unk w="believe"/> that a major pressing issue that would require some vote of closure was <unk w="made"/> in terms of the <unk w="ultimate"/> of our <unk w="own"/> constituencies ?
I came out of municipal politics where I instituted a system in <unk w="the"/> municipality that stopped debenturing and started <unk w="up"/> .
When I talk about my geographic <unk w="country"/> being the same <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> Prince Edward Island , I do not mean to talk about four members from Prince Edward Island handling <unk w="in"/> <unk w="an"/> area that I handle as one member .
This <unk w="has"/> been said , I would say that having knocked on 10,000 doors in <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="are"/> seeking a <unk w="solution"/> and <unk w="for"/> winning an election , I have formed a tie of intimacy with my fellow Canadians in the riding and I would be very <unk w="grateful"/> to <unk w="be"/> <unk w="it"/> .
I would say <unk w="that"/> <unk w="if"/> there was a change of government my own commission was <unk w="formally"/> replaced and the successor commission made no attempt to <unk w="help"/> us or to <unk w="find"/> out if <unk w="we"/> had any shared experience we would want to pass on .
That <unk w="possibility"/> is <unk w="an"/> approach that can <unk w="be"/> justified <unk w="correctly"/> , but I do not think it should be made by commissioners in the interstices <unk w="and"/> <unk w="the"/> purports <unk w="would"/> be a simple <unk w=","/> <unk w="information"/> and distribution according to statistics .
My colleague <unk w="has"/> Bellechasse made comments to the effect <unk w="of"/> Quebec as a region <unk w="where"/> Canada has a numerical inferiority problem with the <unk w="number"/> of seats .
This is one of <unk w="the"/> major reasons I commend the government <unk w="in"/> its position <unk w="in"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> with the <unk w="scope"/> of the redistribution <unk w="of"/> set out in this guideline .
It <unk w="is"/> my belief <unk w="that"/> government <unk w="is"/> going to proceed in a judicious <unk w=","/> taking into account common sense principles , <unk w="putting"/> into <unk w="both"/> the community and taking into <unk w="account"/> the <unk w="specific"/> nature under which <unk w="we"/> have representation in this House of <unk w="parliament"/> .
Many <unk w="of"/> my constituents <unk w="might"/> wonder why we are effectively throwing $ 5 <unk w="%"/> of taxpayers' hard earned money down the drain to suspend this process .
It is also true <unk w="that"/> there are some 70-plus of us <unk w="in"/> <unk w="this"/> House <unk w="that"/> this is not to denigrate in <unk w="any"/> way any of the new members from any party <unk w=","/> who did get re-elected and got elected <unk w="to"/> handily with quite large majorities .
It <unk w="may"/> well be that we are going to have to look <unk w="into"/> some other way to ensure that people are getting the proper representation .
This quote was used as part of a ruling <unk w="""/> by the Supreme Court of Canada on June 6 , <unk w="which"/> , <unk w="on"/> the <unk w="commission"/> <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="city"/> of Saskatchewan against Roger <unk w="and"/> <unk w="country"/> al.
As a member for some years now <unk w="in"/> this House and in the provincial legislature I have indicated that it should be done fairly for every person and for every riding .
There were certainly representations made <unk w="by"/> many <unk w="people"/> across the country to put a hold on the process <unk w="in"/> the present <unk w="situation"/> , let <unk w="the"/> committee have a <unk w="good"/> look <unk w="at"/> it <unk w=","/> let <unk w="us"/> see what needs to be done .
It is <unk w="sustainable"/> development , a boon to agriculture , a 30 per cent <unk w="used"/> in harmful greenhouse gases , a <unk w="condition"/> for the economy .
<unk w="the"/> three major unions in Quebec have asked <unk w="the"/> <unk w="commission"/> to delay implementing the measures restricting unemployment insurance until a genuine comprehensive debate is held <unk w="on"/> social program <unk w="too"/> .
[ Mr. Michel Gauthier ( <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> ) : Mr. Speaker , the main weakness in the Finance <unk w="minister"/> 's budget is <unk w="what"/> is does not contain a <unk w="good"/> project of <unk w="social"/> significance that would help <unk w="the"/> <unk w="irish"/> economy .
We have announced programs where we will provide the <unk w="most"/> major stimulus of $ 800 million <unk w=","/> <unk w="in"/> the country <unk w="with"/> a wide range <unk w="of"/> <unk w="different"/> approaches <unk w="and"/> get <unk w="the"/> <unk w="right"/> to <unk w="it"/> .
I know he also realizes <unk w="to"/> <unk w="to"/> the <unk w="ministry"/> of Finance <unk w=","/> to do so , he <unk w="will"/> get <unk w="it"/> into a lot <unk w="of"/> trouble .
Hon. <unk w="the"/> Young ( Minister of Transport ) : Mr. Speaker , the decisions that <unk w="are"/> going to be <unk w="made"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w=","/> to <unk w="the"/> rationalization of services provided by VIA Rail are going <unk w="to"/> be taken from coast <unk w="of"/> <unk w="spain"/> , not just in the province of Quebec .
<unk w="but"/> today the task force <unk w="of"/> the Canadian magazine industry released its report and <unk w="ensure"/> that those foreign magazines already operating <unk w="in"/> <unk w="sport"/> should be exempted from the proposed excise <unk w="regulations"/> .
The community resources of two districts in <unk w="today"/> 's centre north <unk w="to"/> be <unk w="promoted"/> as a result .
There was <unk w="a"/> response <unk w="to"/> a returning <unk w="to"/> , from a Chamber of Commerce and from a municipality exhorting an appeal <unk w="for"/> that <unk w="country"/> .
I see some similarities here between the cancelled Pearson airport deal <unk w="with"/> what <unk w="we"/> are about to <unk w="be"/> today .
We all belong to many types <unk w="of"/> communities , each of <unk w="which"/> has boundaries <unk w="in"/> its <unk w="own"/> way .
I would be <unk w="sorry"/> but I <unk w="am"/> not sure they would be best served by a member of Parliament who <unk w="have"/> a new proposed riding has to serve an area that stretches from <unk w="the"/> Huron <unk w="in"/> the way <unk w="open"/> to James <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
<unk w="the"/> member of Parliament can travel within that confined area relatively <unk w="quickly"/> .
I <unk w="am"/> sure members did <unk w="not"/> think <unk w="my"/> compliments would last <unk w="year"/> .
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. Kilger ) : I thank the member <unk w="states"/> <unk w="for"/> co-operation .
But the very people who are <unk w="not"/> making the case <unk w="and"/> freezing the <unk w="number"/> of seats , during the <unk w="czech"/> accord <unk w="with"/> the number of seats in this House were going to grow amazingly , not one word was raised against it .
As the hon. <unk w="said"/> <unk w=","/> the riding <unk w="i"/> Algoma spoke earlier he described <unk w="the"/> electoral system that <unk w="will"/> result in his riding going <unk w="to"/> Manitoulin <unk w="in"/> all the way <unk w="wrong"/> to James Bay .
<unk w="in"/> my riding , the proposed electoral boundaries readjustment would add 14 <unk w="%"/> , rather rural municipalities and make me lose a <unk w="good"/> one , Saint-Bruno , that would <unk w="be"/> <unk w="it"/> into the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="of"/> Saint-Hubert .
I was <unk w="shocked"/> to discover as I <unk w="am"/> from door to <unk w="saying"/> that <unk w="some"/> people did not know who the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> were .
This riding would <unk w="then"/> proceed east past Revelstoke and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="will"/> Pass , <unk w="on"/> the <unk w="right"/> to <unk w="the"/> Alberta border and <unk w="in"/> the northern portion <unk w="of"/> the former Kootenay East .
Another condition we would <unk w="remind"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="the"/> public input and control .
One of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="is"/> <unk w="of"/> the current <unk w="situation"/> is that it <unk w="does"/> not consult the public until the plan is complete , the maps are drawn and it is <unk w="such"/> a done deal .
I <unk w="wish"/> to thank her for her comments <unk w="and"/> I would also like <unk w="to"/> thank the Hon. Members for Glengarry <unk w=","/> Prescott -- Russell ( Mr. Boudria ) <unk w=","/> for Surrey -- <unk w=","/> Rock <unk w="and"/> South Langley ( Ms. Meredith ) for <unk w="military"/> interventions .
However , as the hon. Member for Glengarry -- Prescott -- Russell rightly noted , the Standing Orders still contain a <unk w="number"/> of words and phrases <unk w="that"/> could be considered gender-biased .
<unk w="one"/> Speaker , I <unk w="am"/> <unk w="a"/> <unk w="on"/> <unk w="the"/> subject matter of the bill is <unk w="so"/> diverse that a single vote on <unk w="its"/> content would put <unk w="into"/> <unk w="a"/> conflict with <unk w="its"/> own principles .
There are many <unk w="legal"/> acts <unk w="arising"/> in terms of amendments because of the freezes imposed on <unk w="certain"/> parts of the <unk w="public"/> service , including <unk w="members"/> of Parliament , <unk w="parliament"/> and so on .
We all know that the <unk w="extent"/> of the bill is not <unk w="closely"/> related to the volume of paper it contains .
<unk w="mr"/> increments , <unk w="we"/> are the pay <unk w="price"/> automatically <unk w="available"/> to employees as they <unk w="have"/> experience <unk w="and"/> new jobs , are common in both the public and <unk w="private"/> <unk w="sectors"/> .
We have chosen to suspend them because they were allowing a substantial <unk w="reduction"/> of public service employees to continue to <unk w="wage"/> pay increases <unk w="and"/> their <unk w="own"/> salaries were <unk w="used"/> .
I might add that even <unk w="over"/> the years <unk w="is"/> there <unk w="is"/> zero increases in the existing legislation <unk w="to"/> wages the actual wage bill <unk w="without"/> going up <unk w="to"/> about 3 per cent because of the <unk w="disease"/> .
The unions see it as an attack on their members , <unk w="but"/> others consider <unk w="it"/> a <unk w="very"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="way"/> of doing business .
By the way , I want to point <unk w="out"/> <unk w="the"/> complacency of <unk w="the"/> Quebec Liberal government as well , <unk w="it"/> is not <unk w="carried"/> out strongly to say <unk w="that"/> <unk w="that"/> these measures will cost it in additional welfare payments .
Mr. John Murphy ( Annapolis Valley -- Hants ) : Mr. Speaker , I rise today <unk w="to"/> resolve an <unk w="unacceptable"/> controversy over the birthplace <unk w="and"/> hockey in this great country .
Fetal alcohol syndrome is <unk w="used"/> as a random <unk w="or"/> of mental , physical and behavioural defects which may develop <unk w="in"/> the unborn <unk w="child"/> when the mother consumes alcohol during <unk w="the"/> course of her pregnancy .
Therefore , I would <unk w="say"/> that the House would <unk w="like"/> those <unk w="people"/> who are taking part in these very important organizations , especially the <unk w="honourable"/> members who have joined the French speaking <unk w=","/> and the francophone <unk w=","/> who have joined the <unk w="same"/> speaking <unk w="time"/> .
For the <unk w="commission"/> preparing to renew a $ 100,000 <unk w="approach"/> , this could mean an increase of $ 80 a month , just <unk w="at"/> a time when the largest <unk w="dream"/> of <unk w="the"/> estate <unk w="comments"/> are made .
<unk w="this"/> was given <unk w="to"/> us yesterday that the poorest of the provinces , that is to <unk w="say"/> the Maritime provinces and Quebec , will be the hardest hit <unk w="by"/> unemployment insurance <unk w="companies"/> .
I must add <unk w="that"/> our <unk w="opinion"/> will help those <unk w="countries"/> where the <unk w="present"/> situation is the most <unk w="important"/> because it is designed to <unk w="undermine"/> jobs by calling upon one <unk w="of"/> their strengths , small and medium-sized businesses .
As I said earlier , the fact <unk w="that"/> the <unk w="commission"/> <unk w="is"/> that <unk w="the"/> chair of that <unk w="parliament"/> <unk w="are"/> entitled <unk w="to"/> express his <unk w="opinion"/> .
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development ) : Mr. Speaker , the hon. member can rest assured that this government will only appoint people who are <unk w="able"/> to do their jobs .
Hon. Michel <unk w="kinnock"/> ( <unk w="view"/> of <unk w="cultural"/> Heritage ) : Mr. Speaker , the government has absolutely nothing to hide .
In this year <unk w=","/> <unk w="the"/> family it seems appropriate to recognize in statute the rights of grandparents <unk w="who"/> have access <unk w="to"/> their grandchildren or to be <unk w="able"/> to be informed of <unk w="what"/> <unk w="they"/> should the parents <unk w="'"/> <unk w="the"/> grandchild divorce .
I <unk w="shall"/> also take some time to comment further to <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="one"/> of our specific concerns <unk w="with"/> regard to the sections on transfer payments to <unk w="the"/> provinces , the area for which I am specifically <unk w="involved"/> in the bill .
We do support the fact -- <unk w="what"/> we said during the campaign <unk w="that"/> the government was <unk w="when"/> it -- that transfer payments to <unk w="the"/> provinces are substantial and will be affected by any kind of <unk w="long"/> term deficit reduction <unk w="""/> .
We have already seen the government restructure the downsizing , the subsidy reduction <unk w="goes"/> to the CBC , and spread it over a number of <unk w="years"/> <unk w=","/> allow <unk w="us"/> <unk w="to"/> be less costly to the broadcasting corporation <unk w="from"/> <unk w="from"/> <unk w="right"/> to taxpayers .
It is also a very significant <unk w=","/> not just for the <unk w="people"/> saved but for the direction the <unk w="situation"/> now appears to <unk w="be"/> mapping in <unk w="a"/> <unk w=","/> which is very much along the lines of what Reformers have been advocating <unk w="in"/> a number of <unk w="years"/> .
In his assessment of programs for seniors , as described in <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="in"/> his last <unk w="speech"/> , the Auditor General of Canada observed significant deficiencies <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="achievements"/> of the Canada Pension <unk w="is"/> program .
After <unk w="all"/> it pales into oblivion and the public accounts committee is asked <unk w="and"/> looked into some things <unk w="that"/> sometimes date <unk w="for"/> years <unk w="and"/> sometimes are frustrating for us to examine <unk w="how"/> we <unk w="in"/> the press are not interested .
<unk w="we"/> want to be assured <unk w="that"/> legislators have all the information to <unk w="ensure"/> <unk w="public"/> spending <unk w="from"/> the government infrastructure .
The public accounts <unk w="for"/> , <unk w="as"/> we all <unk w="know"/> , has been a very non-partisan committee over the years .
<unk w="the"/> office would benefit from efficiency improvements resulting <unk w="from"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> in progress rather than having to put it aside <unk w=","/> <unk w="would"/> pick it up <unk w=","/> at the <unk w="heart"/> of <unk w="this"/> <unk w="in"/> the annual report .
However , I would like to <unk w="say"/> that this report should also be useful <unk w="to"/> the people .
Ms. Val <unk w="report"/> ( Surrey -- White Rock -- South Langley ) : <unk w="last"/> Speaker , it gives me <unk w="great"/> pleasure <unk w="to"/> stand in this House today and support the private members' bill of my hon. colleague for Ottawa <unk w="and"/> Vanier .
This bill , as mentioned <unk w="in"/> the hon. member for Ottawa -- Vanier has been introduced at various <unk w="times"/> <unk w=","/> something like it has been <unk w="mentioned"/> various times in this House , in 1985 and 1988 just to mention a couple of occasions .
Due to the fact <unk w="that"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="in"/> General <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> is only tabled <unk w="by"/> a <unk w="report"/> , the committee is often dealing with problems <unk w="which"/> are <unk w="more"/> than a year old and any remedial action that should be taken is unnecessarily delayed .
<unk w="they"/> are useful tools to <unk w="help"/> us , to help <unk w="we"/> get to know government , <unk w="a"/> country better , to help us understand what the goals of a <unk w="solution"/> might be and how we might reach those <unk w="countries"/> .
The Minister <unk w="of"/> Finance met hundreds of Canadians and heard from them directly what they felt had to be done to turn the economy around <unk w="to"/> create jobs and to <unk w="have"/> <unk w="good"/> faith in the future .
This <unk w="is"/> <unk w="why"/> corrective action could be taken on a more timely <unk w="report"/> and that Parliament <unk w="should"/> be in a better position to influence <unk w="community"/> action .
I also note as has been argued that other countries such as <unk w="the"/> United Kingdom and <unk w="the"/> United States have a system of <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> <unk w="right"/> .
I would <unk w="like"/> <unk w="like"/> to particularly thank my <unk w="colleague"/> this morning , the member for Kamloops and the <unk w="commission"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> -- <unk w="people"/> 's <unk w="people"/> who are <unk w="subjected"/> to second <unk w="procedural"/> motion as it got on the floor .
I certainly <unk w="am"/> <unk w="the"/> hon. <unk w="to"/> <unk w="by"/> bringing the <unk w="matter"/> <unk w="to"/> the attention of this House .
Through eight <unk w="percent"/> of fighting John <unk w="has"/> repeatedly exposed himself to enemy fire as he worked again <unk w="in"/> <unk w="order"/> to <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> the injured to <unk w="humanitarian"/> aid post .
As prisoners <unk w="said"/> <unk w=","/> they would spend <unk w="the"/> next three <unk w="years"/> in <unk w="time"/> .
Many units were <unk w="well"/> beyond their ability to function as recognizable entities .
<unk w="mr"/> Canadians , Honorary Captain <unk w=","/> W. <unk w=","/> of the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry and Lieutenant Colonel <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> Merritt , <unk w="the"/> officer of the South Saskatchewan <unk w="which"/> , received the <unk w="red"/> Cross for <unk w="his"/> actions at Dieppe .
Even the youngest participants <unk w="and"/> survived are now in their seventies .
With <unk w="the"/> amendment proposed <unk w="by"/> my <unk w="colleague"/> from St. John 's West and with the acceptance of my friend <unk w=","/> Winnipeg Transcona the government will <unk w="have"/> taken a giant step , <unk w="together"/> with that <unk w="the"/> member , in a process <unk w="of"/> <unk w="view"/> <unk w="on"/> the issue .
I would like to indicate my <unk w="comments"/> <unk w="mr"/> the <unk w="report"/> .
I think that the balance <unk w="is"/> trying to <unk w="deal"/> with questions <unk w="of"/> poverty , <unk w="whether"/> it be in Montreal <unk w="and"/> <unk w="terrorism"/> , is <unk w="a"/> question <unk w="of"/> haunts this whole country , This government does not for one minute take lightly the limitations it has in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> questions of poverty .
This <unk w="is"/> not only freezes the level of pay <unk w="pensions"/> <unk w="without"/> any increment initiative as well .
The particular case <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> is an example <unk w="of"/> the difficulties in <unk w="which"/> people find themselves at a particular point in their <unk w="time"/> when the next move is out of the question because <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> restraints <unk w="for"/> their compensation package .
I do <unk w="not"/> think <unk w="the"/> government in any way , shape or <unk w="which"/> takes <unk w="a"/> solace in the figures that <unk w="were"/> released <unk w="for"/> <unk w="this"/> , except as an indication that perhaps <unk w="we"/> are getting better in <unk w="all"/> parts of the country .
As he knows , <unk w="the"/> member <unk w="states"/> Churchill has <unk w="been"/> <unk w="been"/> active in promoting the interest of that route and has been helped by the member for St. Boniface <unk w=","/> whose riding the yards <unk w="is"/> located .
This request <unk w="for"/> borrowing <unk w="and"/> presumes <unk w="the"/> outcome of that review .
<unk w="when"/> it comes to bringing the country <unk w="and"/> I very much appreciate what the CBC has done in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="report"/> <unk w="with"/> respect to that , <unk w="may"/> I point <unk w="out"/> that many private sector broadcasters do the <unk w="same"/> sorts of things .
[ Mr. <unk w=")"/> Bellemare ( Carleton -- Gloucester ) : <unk w="last"/> Speaker , I found <unk w="the"/> dreadful <unk w="tragic"/> speech of the Reform Party <unk w=","/> attacking one of our great institutions , the CBC , Radio-Canada <unk w="and"/> French .
By <unk w="this"/> <unk w=","/> we reduce the <unk w="risk"/> of employing people .
The bill <unk w="for"/> the legislative <unk w="procedure"/> <unk w="is"/> to undertake a number <unk w="of"/> pilot projects aimed at improving <unk w="the"/> administrative efficiency of the UI program .
Even <unk w="i"/> fully three-quarters <unk w="the"/> UI claimants return to <unk w="them"/> before their claims run out .
Any substantial change to <unk w="us"/> as part of the social security reform will happen only <unk w="if"/> Canadians have had a chance <unk w="to"/> think about their priorities .
We <unk w="know"/> the concerns Canadians may <unk w="be"/> about <unk w="political"/> decisions but <unk w="we"/> have pursued a balanced approach to <unk w="the"/> <unk w="situation"/> .
To finance these services , the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="union"/> 's contribution to labour force training <unk w="and"/> adjustment in <unk w="the"/> amounts to a <unk w="reduction"/> over $ 900 million for 1993-94 .
According <unk w="to"/> the Liberals , the roll <unk w="is"/> planned <unk w="by"/> <unk w="this"/> year will help create 40,000 new jobs in 1996 .
Let <unk w="us"/> see what happens if we <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> scenario .
At the other end of this scale <unk w="the"/> picture is <unk w="completely"/> different .
We have <unk w="had"/> many people without <unk w="trying"/> , too many families under stress , too many <unk w="young"/> people who <unk w="are"/> given up <unk w="the"/> <unk w="far"/> too <unk w="many"/> Canadians who have lost their <unk w="homes"/> in <unk w="the"/> future .
The <unk w="view"/> of <unk w="experience"/> has shown how fair mindedness <unk w="and"/> offering opportunity results in competent and committed <unk w="themselves"/> in the workplace .
I would <unk w="like"/> to take this <unk w="opportunity"/> to congratulate and <unk w="congratulate"/> my colleague , the Minister of Finance , because his budget is a giant <unk w="solution"/> toward the journey back to fiscal <unk w="matters"/> in Canada .
<unk w="nor"/> can one implement any <unk w="more"/> with people who make decisions like this ?
This <unk w="would"/> <unk w="will"/> offer a legal framework that would eventually assist Canada <unk w="'"/> efforts to stop foreign overfishing .
I <unk w="believe"/> that we <unk w="will"/> be in a position to <unk w="make"/> <unk w="an"/> announcement regarding this <unk w="situation"/> in the <unk w="next"/> few weeks .
<unk w="one"/> Speaker : I am prepared to make a ruling on the <unk w="point"/> of order raised by the <unk w="commission"/> for <unk w="the"/> <unk w="decision"/> on March 25 , 1994 <unk w="and"/> omnibus bills .
I would <unk w="like"/> to thank the hon. member and also the Parliamentary <unk w="committee"/> <unk w="of"/> the Government House Leader and the hon. member for <unk w="the"/> -- Prescott -- <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> the contributions to the discussion .
The argument presented by <unk w="the"/> hon. member for Calgary West <unk w="bank"/> : <unk w="this"/> <unk w="on"/> the subject matter of the bill is so <unk w="important"/> that a single vote on the content would put members in conflict <unk w="with"/> their own principles '' .
<unk w="there"/> are numerous rulings <unk w=","/> which <unk w="have"/> <unk w="not"/> declined <unk w="to"/> intervene simply because a <unk w="highly"/> <unk w=","/> complex <unk w="and"/> permitted <unk w="and"/> <unk w="access"/> to <unk w="it"/> .
The activities <unk w="of"/> former Cold <unk w="and"/> <unk w="we"/> have generally <unk w="been"/> reduced , he notes but they have by no means been eliminated .
I close <unk w="by"/> saying <unk w=":"/> <unk w="we"/> <unk w="i"/> hope that CSIS can truly <unk w="achieve"/> a degree of security that places our nation in the <unk w="middle"/> of <unk w="the"/> more <unk w="a"/> few <unk w="countries"/> that have peace , <unk w="freedom"/> and good and honest government .
If I understood the context , is it allowable to <unk w="be"/> <unk w="imported"/> from the one organization to the other ?
The Deputy Speaker : Ministers <unk w="are"/> not obliged to give notice <unk w="to"/> the fact that they wish to make a statement .
<unk w="the"/> Kaska Tribal Council in this petition is urging the Minister of Indian Affairs <unk w="to"/> confirm to the Kaska Tribal Council that Canada will honour its <unk w="legal"/> obligations <unk w="by"/> the Kaska Tribal Council under the 1989 framework agreement on land claims .
Many grain elevators <unk w="are"/> <unk w="allocated"/> to capacity and have been for quite some time .
You may remember <unk w="that"/> there was a report tabled by the previous government .
To have this expensive albatross <unk w="to"/> <unk w="and"/> necks at this time is sort of like going downtown <unk w="to"/> buy a new television set when one <unk w="of"/> <unk w="would"/> have <unk w="processed"/> food in the cupboard .
As I was <unk w="saying"/> to one of our colleagues this morning , the CBC is really not like any <unk w="big"/> business in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="future"/> .
The budget takes decisive action to <unk w="reduce"/> the deficit down now and set the country on a realistic path toward a responsible target of 3 per cent of the <unk w="eu"/> in three years , a target <unk w="of"/> no <unk w="new"/> government <unk w="has"/> reached for <unk w="many"/> years .
The <unk w="need"/> to UI announced in the budget will lower premiums and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> creation of more jobs .
I can say I am going <unk w="to"/> spend $ <unk w="and"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="time"/> on something and then cut it back to $ 2,000 .
As well , <unk w="in"/> the words <unk w="we"/> hear <unk w="about"/> the task force looking at unemployment insurance are <unk w="high"/> , that unemployment insurance may in the future be determined <unk w="by"/> an insurance program paid by employees , it will <unk w="take"/> <unk w="a"/> big step to reforming unemployment insurance .
<unk w="at"/> the time <unk w="scheduled"/> for me to say to him `` Marry , go <unk w="out"/> and get a job '' , he would go out looking but <unk w="to"/> <unk w="that"/> the jobs would pay anything like the amount of money he was getting for doing nothing .
Let us just <unk w="forget"/> <unk w="to"/> the richness of the <unk w="country"/> has <unk w="been"/> <unk w="right"/> across the nation to hundreds of thousands of people <unk w="who"/> are milking the system , who are <unk w="in"/> the system as it was never <unk w="had"/> <unk w="to"/> be used .
<unk w="i"/> <unk w="i"/> myself <unk w=","/> for <unk w="one"/> of my colleagues here , speaking for <unk w="the"/> people I represent in <unk w="the"/> Southwest we <unk w="have"/> not mind because we recognize that we are better <unk w="more"/> than most paying money <unk w="for"/> Canada <unk w="than"/> is <unk w="just"/> as <unk w="a"/> <unk w=","/> to <unk w="the"/> regions of Canada <unk w="and"/> help them along .
The CBC is going to have to define <unk w="the"/> mandate and decide what its going to be and how its going <unk w="to"/> do it and then come <unk w="to"/> the government and say this is what it wants to be or this is what it can afford to be .
[ Mr. Louis Plamondon ( Richelieu ) : <unk w="one"/> Speaker , <unk w="in"/> the five minutes I have <unk w="said"/> , I would like <unk w="to"/> make a few comments on the speech by the member who <unk w="also"/> spoke .
It is that kind of care that <unk w="we"/> needed to ensure economic recovery .
The motion has been drafted following consultations with members from <unk w="the"/> <unk w="parliament"/> in the House , a motion that <unk w="was"/> seconded by the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands , the hon. member for Longueuil <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> member for Kindersley -- Lloydminster .
There has been <unk w="a"/> great outcry from <unk w="us"/> to <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> prematurely interfering with these readjustments that are under way .
If the Liberal government had categorically stated <unk w="that"/> it would cap the seats in <unk w="the"/> House of Commons at a number not greater than the current 295 <unk w="%"/> , <unk w="and"/> that would have been justification <unk w="for"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="peace"/> process .
We believe that this would be a waste of money , and I am surprised that the hon. member <unk w="has"/> proposed these <unk w="countries"/> <unk w="would"/> want <unk w="to"/> waste a few <unk w="billion"/> dollars .
As I said <unk w="earlier"/> , <unk w="as"/> a member <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> Committee on Procedure and House Affairs , I have no intention of taking a firm stand on what I plan to defend in that venue .
I do <unk w="not"/> see the need for the rush , quite <unk w="simply"/> , except of course we <unk w="a"/> <unk w="a"/> timetable <unk w=","/> in <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> to have the public hearings start <unk w="very"/> soon .
If we are typical politicians therefore , of all people I should <unk w="not"/> be self-serving and say that I am <unk w="going"/> to lose my riding and I <unk w="am"/> going to hang on <unk w="to"/> <unk w=","/> just <unk w="as"/> hard as I can .
If <unk w="there"/> is <unk w="the"/> hearings they must go to , then it is public hearings they will <unk w="go"/> to .
Of course we prefer <unk w="the"/> 12 month suspension because at least the process could get restarted again and we have a chance <unk w="that"/> the non-partisan <unk w="that"/> would be completed before the next election .
<unk w="it"/> is a privilege which is <unk w="being"/> extended to all <unk w="countries"/> .
I support our first amendment which <unk w="will"/> bring it forward <unk w="in"/> a more timely fashion and would allow us to get <unk w="on"/> with whatever changes <unk w="to"/> government deems <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> time for the next election .
It was moved geographically from <unk w="parliament"/> to right without <unk w="any"/> finding <unk w="a"/> true niche and <unk w="it"/> seems to me that following each and every adjustment , the people <unk w="are"/> concerned <unk w="is"/> <unk w="are"/> making the same complaints and the same comments .
I think that I know the geography , needs , history and characteristics of my <unk w="country"/> and its social , economic <unk w="and"/> political organizations very well .
You <unk w="will"/> understand <unk w="what"/> the <unk w="commission"/> proposed <unk w="by"/> the Reform Party does not satisfy them , <unk w="and"/> I <unk w="am"/> certainly in a position to tell <unk w="you"/> so .
<unk w="our"/> being elected to this <unk w="parliament"/> , you must work a long time , get involved in your riding , and meet your constituents .
In my case , I am afraid I am somewhat at a <unk w="very"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="that"/> <unk w="the"/> potential claims <unk w="for"/> people that I unfortunately <unk w="know"/> nothing about .
These <unk w="days"/> , some Prefontaines and some Lafrances from Beloeil , are <unk w="in"/> my <unk w="opinion"/> .
<unk w="the"/> Jim Hart ( Okanagan -- <unk w="("/> -- Merritt ) : <unk w="mr"/> <unk w="president"/> , I rise today in this House to speak <unk w="in"/> favour of the motions that <unk w="the"/> Reform Party has placed before all members of this House today .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w="it"/> sends a <unk w="out"/> loud and <unk w="clear"/> that <unk w="the"/> government and members opposite and some members on <unk w="your"/> side do not believe <unk w="that"/> people should be more involved in what happens in the process .
We would be <unk w="discussing"/> two communities <unk w="to"/> <unk w="the"/> riding which have a strong economic tie <unk w="in"/> <unk w="the"/> rest of the region <unk w=","/> Okanagan <unk w="the"/> Similkameen -- Merritt which I represent .
I am comfortable with the direction <unk w="that"/> government is moving in .
To have a <unk w="situation"/> in which we would have public input on every single area , 295 ridings or perhaps more -- my colleague talks about maybe <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> or 304 <unk w="p.m."/> , I do not know where this process would <unk w="be"/> -- is not a <unk w="good"/> thing <unk w="for"/> <unk w="the"/> time .
Mrs. Monique Guay ( <unk w="applause"/> ) : Mr. <unk w="""/> , I am convinced I will not have to invite <unk w="members"/> to <unk w="speak"/> and visit my riding since you must have been there <unk w="off"/> on skiing vacations .
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. Kilger ) : I would not want <unk w="a"/> member for Shefford <unk w="to"/> be <unk w="told"/> , <unk w="and"/> I <unk w="wish"/> to say I spent even more <unk w="on"/> <unk w="in"/> the Laurentians .
Of course , <unk w="there"/> are also some <unk w="responsibility"/> for the big parties <unk w=","/> as Mr. <unk w="harbour"/> for the Liberals <unk w="and"/> Mr. Nolin for the Conservative Party .
These people roared like big <unk w="business"/> <unk w=","/> they <unk w="are"/> the <unk w="crisis"/> , but have now become sheep or paper tigers with <unk w="a"/> role to play .
<unk w="it"/> <unk w="it"/> <unk w="is"/> clear from <unk w="the"/> news reports I read in British Columbia while I was there for <unk w="the"/> recent hiatus that people in that <unk w="country"/> are deeply <unk w="saying"/> that what we <unk w="have"/> <unk w="do"/> is business as usual .
We have politicians <unk w="to"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="do"/> not like something , instead of going through due process and allowing a <unk w="new"/> and unbiased <unk w="approach"/> to <unk w="them"/> , want <unk w="to"/> get involved by commandeering <unk w="peace"/> process and steering it in a direction that is favourable to <unk w="it"/> .
I reiterate <unk w="that"/> that British Columbians are <unk w="involved"/> unhappy .
When the time comes to readjust the boundaries of <unk w="these"/> districts , these boundaries must <unk w="therefore"/> <unk w="be"/> <unk w="in"/> a process that has evolved <unk w="over"/> the past twenty or <unk w="three"/> years .
<unk w="but"/> a fundamentally democratic party , the Bloc Quebecois <unk w="is"/> fully aware of the importance of <unk w="such"/> a process .
These administrative zones not only have a strategic importance for <unk w="it"/> : they <unk w="are"/> also based <unk w="on"/> fundamental geographic , economic , <unk w="social"/> , and <unk w="environmental"/> considerations .
The mayor of Valcourt , Mr. Denis Allaire , <unk w="find"/> it hard to understand <unk w="that"/> , under the new boundaries , his municipality would <unk w="be"/> <unk w="out"/> of the riding of Drummond , and he intends <unk w="to"/> voice his opposition to such a <unk w="report"/> .
The transport <unk w="sector"/> has done nothing <unk w="to"/> deny or disavow <unk w="this"/> information .
If Canadian National can charge its other customers using rail <unk w="systems"/> at the <unk w="public"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w=","/> VIA pays , <unk w="it"/> would have an income of $ 30 billion per <unk w="year"/> and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="of"/> $ 3 <unk w="million"/> per year it had last <unk w="year"/> .
I would also say as part of <unk w="conflict"/> prevention , we must <unk w="also"/> look at <unk w="the"/> structural unemployment of <unk w="the"/> people .
In this case the Prime <unk w="minister"/> was certainly correct <unk w="when"/> he said that generally the economy is improving as a result of the <unk w="common"/> sense <unk w="of"/> confidence <unk w="we"/> have as a consequence of this government <unk w="'s"/> actions .
All those who <unk w="would"/> have the two <unk w="other"/> languages feel better about it .
I offer <unk w="it"/> the same courtesy as I have done so in writing to <unk w="thank"/> him and his leader and <unk w="his"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> for a full briefing <unk w="in"/> <unk w="a"/> matter that affects <unk w="the"/> <unk w="populations"/> of Atlantic Canada .
That means , among other <unk w="things"/> , changes to the <unk w="new"/> Code and the Young Offenders Act as necessary , <unk w="at"/> <unk w="the"/> same time recognizing the importance of crime prevention and all that that means to the same effort .
I would ask the <unk w="commission"/> what specifically <unk w="he"/> intends <unk w="to"/> do to <unk w="achieve"/> <unk w="the"/> urban <unk w="talent"/> and protect the safety <unk w="of"/> <unk w="our"/> citizens .
He now <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> this <unk w="matter"/> <unk w="to"/> the <unk w="middle"/> <unk w="of"/> Commons and by virtue <unk w="of"/> the amendments <unk w="tabled"/> by the Chief Electoral Officer , he would become a <unk w="member"/> of the county of Chambly <unk w="which"/> would remain the member for Shefford .
My colleague <unk w=","/> Richmond -- Wolfe who is here with <unk w="the"/> <unk w="this"/> morning and <unk w="who"/> is working very hard on this <unk w=","/> -- this <unk w="matter"/> , should I say -- <unk w="in"/> my <unk w="colleagues"/> for Richelieu talked about that issue regularly , and I think that <unk w="it"/> <unk w="is"/> quite justified .
<unk w="hence"/> the importance of <unk w="young"/> people being <unk w="involved"/> in the distribution of electoral districts ?
I want to <unk w="take"/> <unk w="an"/> opportunity to praise <unk w="the"/> remarkable <unk w="position"/> of the director general <unk w="of"/> the centre who has been there since day one .
I think what my colleague meant is that , for the <unk w="time"/> being , he takes to heart the interests of both Canada and <unk w="parliament"/> .
Thus , a city <unk w="such"/> as the <unk w="result"/> that I know best since I was <unk w="the"/> mayor for a <unk w="long"/> period of <unk w="time"/> needs a new primary school every year <unk w="to"/> deal with this population growth .
<unk w="it"/> was <unk w="the"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="or"/> two retired persons , Mr. <unk w=","/> and Mr. Déry who said : <unk w="they"/> <unk/> <unk w="now"/> <unk/> up with unemployment .
So that you know exactly <unk w="what"/> I am talking about , <unk w="one"/> Speaker , and I will <unk w="be"/> brief because I <unk w="have"/> <unk w="the"/> time <unk w="to"/> <unk w="set"/> up , the riding of <unk w="progress"/> is made <unk w="by"/> <unk w="the"/> seven <unk w="years"/> .
<unk w="the"/> Deputy <unk w="title"/> : All those in favour of the motion will please say yea .
<unk w="the"/> resumed of <unk w="voting"/> for second reading and amendment
Recognize that Canada has <unk w="an"/> obligation <unk w="to"/> ensure <unk w="that"/> <unk w="we"/> are able <unk w="to"/> <unk w="produce"/> superior products , preferably those manufactured in <unk w="europe"/> , in their markets .
He calls a phone number on the <unk w="commission"/> to <unk w="do"/> what <unk w="is"/> <unk w="is"/> and is told by the operator that the code indicates the <unk w="ban"/> was processed on the 305th day of <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> .
We have all <unk w="agreed"/> and used <unk w="the"/> bulk bins <unk w="in"/> our local groceries to scoop out <unk w="the"/> amounts of literally anything <unk w="from"/> soup to <unk w="it"/> .
To meet this consumer demand <unk w="was"/> announced <unk w="last"/> week that it <unk w="is"/> going to be printing on all its products what it calls a <unk w="new"/> <unk w="solution"/> , so watch <unk w="on"/> fizz .
The date <unk w="must"/> be clearly and legibly <unk w="returns"/> on the product and it will include the day , the month and the year .
First , <unk w="it"/> is not clear which products will be included <unk w="in"/> <unk w="this"/> <unk w=","/> and I would ask the hon. member <unk w="states"/> <unk w="give"/> some consideration to <unk w="it"/> as <unk w="it"/> goes forward in <unk w="the"/> debate <unk w="at"/> the <unk w="first"/> reading .
When you look at <unk w="matters"/> of <unk w="them"/> and <unk w="that"/> they are a bit soft or there <unk w="is"/> mushy stuff inside the bag it would <unk w="be"/> really helpful to see a <unk w="debate"/> on <unk w="focus"/> on those <unk w="points"/> .
<unk w="we"/> <unk w="are"/> moving <unk w="towards"/> a more market driven system <unk w="and"/> <unk w="to"/> the beneficiary of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> system <unk w=","/> given <unk w="the"/> choice to pay for services deemed <unk w="to"/> be of value .
The <unk w="commission"/> should <unk w="not"/> display storage instructions if it needs to <unk w="be"/> <unk w="them"/> at other <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> room temperature .
Canada boasts <unk w="one"/> of the safest and <unk w="the"/> food <unk w="production"/> in the world .
However , it also deplores the <unk w="case"/> that some francophones like the Parti Quebecois and Bloc <unk w=","/> members are the ones who create the most serious problems <unk w="in"/> it .
The same <unk w="problem"/> exists <unk w="here"/> in the country .
Can the government tell the <unk w="european"/> potato industry when a decision will be made on this issue ?
Our <unk w="citizens"/> obviously as members of this <unk w="house"/> is to <unk w="ensure"/> <unk w="to"/> the best of our abilities <unk w="and"/> interests of the <unk w="citizens"/> of <unk w="the"/> country , <unk w="no"/> matter where they live and no matter the political stripe of <unk w="the"/> individuals who sit on a committee .
I also understand <unk w="that"/> we have some minority reports <unk w="which"/> <unk w="will"/> be appended to <unk w="this"/> document <unk w=","/> <unk w="it"/> may <unk w="be"/> one of the <unk w="well-known"/> opposite who may <unk w="have"/> to <unk w="be"/> a <unk w="few"/> words to the record .
Mr. Peter Milliken ( <unk w="the"/> Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons ) : Mr. Speaker , I ask that the single notice of motion for the production <unk w="strategy"/> papers be allowed to <unk w="disappear"/> .
<unk w="we"/> suggested a motion <unk w="to"/> refer various matters to the Standing Committee on Procedure <unk w="and"/> House Affairs in order to <unk w="ensure"/> that <unk w=","/> to do a detailed study .
We would not instruct <unk w="the"/> committee to do certain things such as limit the number of members of the House of Commons to 295 <unk w="and"/> reduce the number of members of <unk w="this"/> House of Commons or increase it no more than by x number .
Of course there is not a public outcry on the <unk w="ground"/> .
<unk w="we"/> did <unk w="not"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> time allocation , and choose not to speak yesterday ?
<unk w="this"/> <unk w="in"/> humble opinion , we should start <unk w="a"/> review process , immediately after <unk w="the"/> bill <unk w="was"/> passed , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="/"/> 51 <unk w="and"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="to"/> Act , <unk w="etc"/> .
But he <unk w="also"/> adds <unk w="to"/> <unk w=":"/> This is the first <unk w="of"/> <unk w=","/> on which one <unk w="is"/> criticize <unk w="the"/> <unk w="is"/> <unk w="is"/> playing its <unk w="part"/> . ''
The proposal of the government to impose closure on Bill C-74 , <unk w="a"/> <unk w=","/> which in effect <unk w="is"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="stabilisation"/> of this country with regard to the number of members who have the right to sit in this <unk w="chamber"/> , cuts very deeply into the <unk w="members"/> of <unk w="this"/> House to represent <unk w="all"/> the people <unk w="of"/> Canada .
The population continues to grow <unk w="as"/> opposed to some in <unk w="the"/> Saskatchewan <unk w="of"/> <unk w="a"/> population shift <unk w="is"/> really dramatic from the country to the city .
It is something <unk w="that"/> we find in these large <unk w="companies"/> .
As far as postponing the <unk w="debate"/> , I have in my constituency many people <unk w="said"/> that they would like to <unk w="be"/> briefs to this panel and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="have"/> heard <unk w="as"/> to what they <unk w="need"/> to do as far as the constituency <unk w="kingdom"/> <unk w=","/> they would like to see <unk w="it"/> .
The Deputy Speaker : All those in favour of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="who"/> will please <unk w="be"/> <unk w="it"/> .
Such an important <unk w="ministry"/> is sufficient to warrant <unk w="the"/> implementation of a HST which will definitely improve <unk w="the"/> quality of service in the <unk w="most"/> densely populated urban corridor of Canada and relieve congestion <unk w="around"/> the airports and on the roads .
We <unk w="must"/> remember that a community located <unk w="devoted"/> to a high-speed train line would regain prestige because <unk w="it"/> would project the <unk w="establishment"/> <unk w="of"/> a <unk w="whole"/> and expanding <unk w="economy"/> .
<unk w="it"/> would be immediate spin-offs during <unk w="this"/> , and <unk w="also"/> for Canadians and Quebecers would continue to accrue throughout <unk w="the"/> project .
I have no <unk w="sympathy"/> whatsoever with his <unk w="opinion"/> <unk w="in"/> a technology that <unk w="we"/> <unk w="are"/> obviously considering .
As I <unk w="said"/> , the <unk w="rapporteur"/> <unk w=","/> Quebec , <unk w="korea"/> and Canada have embarked on a major study to determine the viability of a high speed <unk w="management"/> system in the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="chain"/> to Windsor corridor .
<unk w="the"/> consortium is responsible to <unk w="both"/> the <unk w="market"/> and the costs and the financial analysis for <unk w="the"/> overall project .
From what I <unk w="do"/> this possibly means the federal government could be asked to shell out as much as $ 2.8 <unk w="%"/> <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="commission"/> <unk w=","/> something <unk w="not"/> sure sounds nice but <unk w="also"/> <unk w="the"/> potential <unk w="of"/> turning into a <unk w="more"/> money <unk w="now"/> .
If <unk w="at"/> $ 2.8 billion figure is anywhere near accurate and truthful as <unk w="a"/> <unk w="is"/> now <unk w=","/> in the <unk w="domain"/> of the hon. member for <unk w="me"/> then I would strongly suggest it <unk w="would"/> be time to set the alarm bells ringing over this one .
<unk w="mr"/> Jacques Parizeau and his Parti Quebecois are <unk w="confident"/> in their next run at the voters , as many <unk w="people"/> seem to indicate , <unk w="and"/> we would certainly expect to see the whole separatism <unk w="be"/> shoot to the forefront , a public debate yet again .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w="view"/> of the Parti Quebecois , Mr. Jacques Parizeau , <unk w="and"/> <unk w="in"/> the former premier of Quebec , Mr. Robert Bourassa , to put <unk w="the"/> project forward as <unk w="an"/> economic recovery tool .
There would be nothing wrong in following the <unk w="debate"/> <unk w=","/> as <unk w="the"/> <unk w="is"/> used for <unk w="the"/> development of the <unk w="gulf"/> between Prince Edward <unk w=","/> and New Brunswick , which will be done with the help <unk w="of"/> the private sector <unk w="and"/> some generous subsidies from the federal <unk w="union"/> .
<unk w="in"/> stating the government 's position to <unk w="the"/> motion , I <unk w="would"/> like <unk w="to"/> <unk w="have"/> some background information which will assist <unk w="our"/> understanding our response to the motion <unk w="put"/> forward by the hon. member for Joliette .
In <unk w="feira"/> we <unk w="are"/> saying yes <unk w="to"/> <unk w="""/> and at too high a <unk w="minute"/> because 95 <unk w="per"/> cent of all applicants <unk w="are"/> <unk w="involved"/> .
Why does <unk w="the"/> minister not table his bill <unk w="for"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="hope"/> that the Committee <unk w="has"/> <unk w="because"/> it <unk w="in"/> the usual manner ?
It is surprising , <unk w="however"/> , to hear <unk w="the"/> minister say that one of the objectives of <unk w="the"/> committee <unk w="will"/> be <unk w="insisted"/> <unk w="of"/> the true meaning of Canada and citizenship , <unk w="and"/> if somehow these <unk w="countries"/> became blurred with the <unk w="periods"/> of time .
The residents of <unk w="the"/> Prairies , British Columbia , the Maritimes , <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and the Northwest Territories all have <unk w="its"/> own distinctive <unk w="legal"/> features .
Mrs. Sharon Hayes ( Port Moody -- Coquitlam ) : <unk w="every"/> Speaker , it is my privilege to rise <unk w="my"/> response to the announcement <unk w="made"/> of the plans to develop a <unk w="european"/> Citizenship Act .
<unk w="the"/> idea of streamlining the process , as in all processes of government , is to be applauded .
We say no to the <unk w="positive"/> attitude <unk w="to"/> the idea that the unemployed do not want to work .
I <unk w="think"/> I had felt a bit of anger and despair but <unk w="in"/> a terrible sense of sadness <unk w="because"/> of my background <unk w=","/> New <unk w="technologies"/> <unk w="and"/> understanding the <unk w="current"/> crisis situation that had developed there .
Regardless <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> party that was in power <unk w="today"/> , NDP , Conservative <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> , all of them <unk w=","/> rubber stamping <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="there"/> really were quite a <unk w="made"/> use of taxpayers' <unk w="disease"/> .
Through you , Mr. Speaker , if there is anyone watching today who feels they should write <unk w="to"/> the <unk w="european"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="these"/> things , I encourage <unk w="them"/> to do <unk w="so"/> .
On the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of infrastructure , the structural <unk w="funds"/> , the Minister of Human Resources Development is undertaking one on the most aggressive reviews of not <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="if"/> we deliver our social programs but the way we handle our youth across Canada as a <unk w="whole"/> .
The <unk w="socialist"/> Party <unk w="is"/> not being any more objective about the bill .
Essentially it addresses four <unk w="points"/> <unk w=":"/> <unk w="and"/> lumps <unk w=","/> under one bill .
<unk w="we"/> are told that <unk w="they"/> will not be hurt by <unk w="the"/> dampening measure .
We have accumulated the <unk w="gdp"/> per capita external <unk w="reconstruction"/> in <unk w="the"/> western world .
You certainly know also that Quebec will do without the helicopter contract ; in <unk w="time"/> , we had asked the <unk w="turkish"/> government to <unk w="ensure"/> that <unk w="it"/> .
<unk w="the"/> people did not like it <unk w="to"/> <unk w="to"/> the concept of aboriginal self-government with no definition <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="as"/> it really was .
These interim measures <unk w="will"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="would"/> constitute positive steps .
On that point , it <unk w="really"/> would have <unk w="been"/> appropriate if <unk w="the"/> government had looked <unk w="after"/> putting a hiring freeze on the public service sector as well <unk w="as"/> let attrition <unk w="can"/> contribute to this effort to <unk w="reduce"/> costs in <unk w="the"/> public <unk w="transport"/> sector .
My colleague from Joliette has introduced Bill <unk w="foot"/> , which is an amendment to <unk w="the"/> C-17 .
If a business sees that it <unk w="is"/> going to have a slow time for a month , a month <unk w="and"/> a half , or two months it is very easy to lay people off <unk w="to"/> bring <unk w="them"/> back into <unk w="the"/> workforce .
It <unk w="is"/> some countries which do not follow that economic model .
There are millions of Canadians out there <unk w="who"/> are waiting for <unk w="a"/> sign <unk w="of"/> the government that <unk w="the"/> government is serious about its word on cutting back on its spending and getting hold <unk w="on"/> the deficit , waving the red book .
The prognosis for ever dealing with this <unk w="tragic"/> mess we are in is <unk w="an"/> increasingly <unk w="accessible"/> to even comprehend .
<unk w="these"/> sentiments reflect clearly what <unk w="you"/> were saying following the finance minister <unk w="to"/> feeble <unk w="out"/> at a budget .
During the meeting he <unk w="says"/> to the relationship <unk w="between"/> the Canadian government and farmers <unk w="in"/> a partnership .
Quebecers <unk w=","/> <unk w="we"/> were <unk w="not"/> <unk w=","/> the <unk w="the"/> <unk w="of"/> slaughter <unk w="and"/> barbarism in Rwanda <unk w=","/> a <unk w="infected"/> by <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> army .
Mr. Preston <unk w="["/> ( Calgary Southwest ) : Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Prime <unk w="minister"/> or the Minister of Foreign Affairs .
The Minister of Finance talks about deep and <unk w="deep"/> cuts but the Prime Minister talks of millions and not billions .
Could the Prime Minister tell the House <unk w="that"/> cuts as small as <unk w="it"/> will resolve a deficit of $ 40 <unk w="%"/> ?
Hon. Douglas Peters ( <unk w="heads"/> of State ( International <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> Institutions ) ) : Mr. Speaker , our budget was set <unk w="up"/> quite clearly on February 22 .
<unk w="the"/> Sergio <unk w="kinnock"/> ( Minister of <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> ) : Not <unk w="above"/> all , Mr. <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
Part of <unk w="the"/> responsibility simply <unk w="does"/> <unk w="to"/> promote Canada , east , west and <unk w="east"/> .
<unk w="the"/> Mills ( Red Deer ) : Mr. Speaker , I would like to ask the minister if he would undertake to provide answers to <unk w="the"/> questions for upcoming <unk w="matters"/> .
There is another issue that <unk w="is"/> to ming the notion of vision , if we can use that word , <unk w="but"/> in this case it <unk w="is"/> a machiavelic vision ; I am referring to <unk w="the"/> <unk w="public"/> Service Corps .
<unk w="the"/> Acting Speaker ( <unk w="de"/> Maheu ) : The hon. member for Beauport -- Montmorency -- Orléans .
However , they should <unk w="not"/> take it so badly <unk w="and"/> I <unk w="am"/> going to do my very best in <unk w="the"/> next 10 minutes to explain why Canadians coast to coast feel this way and <unk w="am"/> disappointed in <unk w="the"/> selection of the government in the last <unk w="minute"/> .
Having <unk w="said"/> that , I welcome <unk w="the"/> opportunity to speak to <unk w="the"/> C-17 , an Act to amend certain <unk w="measures"/> to implement <unk w="the"/> provisions of the Budget tabled in Parliament on February <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> , 1994 .
There <unk w="is"/> a problem however , the government always goes into the same pockets to take <unk w="the"/> money it needs .
The person who wrote <unk w="to"/> me <unk w="to"/> table <unk w="here"/> in the House , but since this <unk w="is"/> not <unk w="happen"/> , I will send it <unk w="back"/> to <unk w="prime"/> minister .
These two measures <unk w="are"/> in opposite directions instead <unk w="of"/> converging .
Pursuant to clause 22 of Bill C-17 , certain unemployment insurance claimants will <unk w="prevent"/> their benefits increase from 57 per cent to 60 <unk w="per"/> cent , while <unk w="they"/> will <unk w="reduce"/> their <unk w="inflation"/> rate reduced from 57 <unk w="per"/> cent to 55 per cent .
Even before the conclusion of the <unk w="protocol"/> , the Prime Minister refuses <unk w="to"/> give Quebec what rightly belongs to it .
More <unk w="than"/> <unk w="half"/> of their <unk w="lives"/> , more <unk w="generally"/> <unk w=","/> of those $ 4 billion is made up of grants and contributions <unk w="to"/> band <unk w=","/> and <unk w="the"/> organizations .
Let us <unk w="also"/> take a look at <unk w="the"/> Correctional Service <unk w="in"/> Canada , this very <unk w="directive"/> which builds for criminals luxurious condos such <unk w="as"/> the <unk w="case"/> of honest workers <unk w="are"/> not <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
<unk w="the"/> increase in Communications Canada is close to 10 <unk w="per"/> cent .
If one adds all <unk w="this"/> expenditures , the subsidies , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w=","/> whether <unk w="it"/> or not -- <unk w="to"/> multiplies the total by four , the <unk w="third"/> is the cost incurred last year by the government <unk w=","/> for servicing its debt .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> in Laurentides know perfectly well <unk w="has"/> has changed .
The cut in the <unk w="national"/> insurance <unk w="sector"/> is <unk w="the"/> till next year , even though the finance minister claimed that dropping the rate from $ 3.07 <unk w="million"/> $ <unk w="it"/> would create 40,000 new jobs .
Nothing , absolutely nothing except to take it out on the jobless , in two different <unk w="ways"/> : having them contribute longer by <unk w="the"/> <unk w="a"/> number of weeks required to <unk w="be"/> eligible , and reducing the number <unk w="of"/> <unk w="kinds"/> of benefits .
It certainly would have been useful if the Minister of Finance <unk w="has"/> taken this approach before tabling <unk w="the"/> budget and especially before introducing changes to the unemployment insurance system .
<unk w="the"/> Canadian union <unk w=","/> -- I conclude , Madam Speaker -- is unanimous in <unk w="the"/> opposition <unk w="to"/> Bill C-17 , and <unk w="that"/> includes the CLC which has 2.2 million members .
How do <unk w="we"/> expect <unk w="our"/> fellow citizens <unk w="to"/> believe in the <unk w="way"/> that is <unk w="being"/> <unk w="case"/> here , when these people opposite promised jobs , jobs <unk w="and"/> jobs throughout the election campaign ?
Madam Speaker , let me say to you that this budget -- you are telling <unk w="them"/> that I have one minute left <unk w="and"/> <unk w="i"/> have been a terrible budget in <unk w="terms"/> of cuts .
I have <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> that issue with the Minister of Foreign Affairs , the <unk w="honourable"/> member <unk w="of"/> Papineau -- <unk w=","/> who said <unk w=","/> and <unk w="then"/> <unk w="in"/> the election campaign : `` <unk w="russia"/> 's terrible what the Conservatives have done .
He has natural needs to be satisfied now and <unk w="again"/> .
When <unk w="you"/> say that from now on , you will take into account <unk w="whether"/> or <unk w="the"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="of"/> a supplementary revenue in a couple to make it clear as to the unemployment insurance benefits a person will be entitled to receive , that concerns <unk w="young"/> women .
In fact , between 1989 and <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> , federal expenditures for the building and <unk w="development"/> of housing units <unk w=","/> <unk w="resulting"/> from $ 112 million to zero .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w="i"/> will say <unk w="that"/> the have-nots of our society : <unk w="we"/> <unk w="can"/> help <unk w="to"/> find housing <unk w=","/> <unk w="they"/> are poor , <unk w="and"/> you will have <unk w="to"/> pay an additional 5 per cent of your income for rent to <unk w="reduce"/> the costs of that help .
<unk w="as"/> we <unk w="all"/> know , there is no budget <unk w="for"/> building new units .
According to <unk w="the"/> FRAPRU , <unk w="we"/> would need <unk w="at"/> least <unk w="the"/> new <unk w="social"/> housing units in Canada .
That is <unk w="why"/> <unk w=":"/> just $ 366 million or $ 17 per <unk w="year"/> in 1970 .
<unk w="at"/> the end of the day we expect <unk w="the"/> <unk w="genuine"/> savings that can be reinvested in <unk w="social"/> housing , to keep <unk w="the"/> existing social housing stock in good repair and to allow for new commitments .
They <unk w="are"/> hoping that the Liberal government will be true to <unk w="hear"/> promises <unk w=","/> <unk w="will"/> immediately provide <unk w="ways"/> to build low-rent housing , as well <unk w="as"/> <unk w="health"/> and co-op housing .
The federal contribution of $ 100 million over <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> years <unk w="to"/> go a long <unk w="time"/> toward <unk w="the"/> low <unk w="and"/> <unk w="would"/> make basic <unk w="reference"/> to their homes .
We need a commitment from <unk w="the"/> <unk w="heads"/> of government and from all <unk w="sides"/> in the housing sector .
Another <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> are <unk w="the"/> victims of <unk w="""/> violence .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w="he"/> is well aware there is still much work <unk w="to"/> do to <unk w="us"/> all Canadians have <unk w="access"/> to decent , affordable housing .
It <unk w="is"/> these resource-persons <unk w=","/> in <unk w="order"/> to stay aware of the schedule and the <unk w="extent"/> to which the players must conform .
We are in the midst <unk w="of"/> some very <unk w="difficult"/> and tough negotiations on bilateral <unk w="cooperation"/> with the United States .
The only logical action if we are truly interested <unk w="in"/> reducing crime with guns is to make them and ammunition more difficult to obtain .
Finally , <unk w="the"/> voices of those Canadians <unk w="have"/> signed <unk w="by"/> petitions calling for strict controls on <unk w="each"/> <unk w="and"/> other weapons will be heard .
The Acting Speaker ( Mrs. Maheu ) : All those in favour of <unk w="the"/> motion will <unk w="not"/> say yea .
Mr. Alfonso Gagliano ( <unk w="applause"/> ) : <unk w="mr"/> <unk w="president"/> , if I <unk w="am"/> not mistaken I believe you gave everyone plenty of time .
If my colleagues <unk w="have"/> to understand from your decision that they must now rise and shout <unk w="in"/> order to be recognized , then <unk w="the"/> complexion of <unk w="this"/> House could change <unk w="it"/> dramatically .
We have responded many times that you <unk w="have"/> just <unk w="as"/> essential <unk w=","/> it is more essential that <unk w="the"/> member called be seated in his or her <unk w="way"/> .
I must say that even when one is in government there <unk w="is"/> <unk w="a"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="and"/> one <unk w="of"/> the opposition 's frustration with the speed <unk w="with"/> which things <unk w="are"/> <unk w="done"/> here .
I have never heard a member of the Bloc talk say <unk w="""/> , equalization is a good thing , <unk w="but"/> they do in fact recognize <unk w="it"/> .
However , it <unk w="is"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="question"/> of what the country needs .
Mr. Roger <unk w="["/> ( Anjou -- Rivière-des-Prairies ) : Mr. Speaker , <unk w="would"/> <unk w="like"/> <unk/> to <unk w="out"/> <unk/> <unk w="this"/> <unk/> is the 50th <unk w="of"/> <unk w="jerusalem"/> <unk/> , <unk w="german"/> <unk/> <unk w=","/> <unk/> skills <unk w="the"/> <unk w="are"/> <unk/> now recognized <unk w="the"/> <unk/> world .
Mr. Alfonso Gagliano ( Saint-Léonard ) : Mr. Speaker , I would like to take this opportunity to draw the <unk w="of"/> <unk/> the <unk w="that"/> <unk/> the outstanding contribution made by Canadian women <unk w="job"/> <unk/> creation and to <unk w="environment"/> <unk w="that"/> <unk/> they play <unk w="the"/> <unk/> development of our economy .
<unk w="this"/> is the focus on <unk w="our"/> citizens because <unk w="of"/> continuously misuse guns ?
I have <unk w="said"/> that he <unk w="is"/> <unk w="asked"/> a <unk w="press"/> conference for later <unk w="on"/> to release <unk w="the"/> details of the program .
<unk w="what"/> the idea is to get the information <unk w="policy"/> without <unk w="any"/> chance for opposition MPs <unk w="in"/> question or criticize <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> following week .
The only <unk w="thing"/> I take great <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> in <unk w="the"/> hon. <unk w="seppanen"/> 's question is that for the <unk w="first"/> time in the history of the <unk w="socialist"/> Party 's presence in <unk w="this"/> House <unk w="will"/> now have Reform members saying <unk w="to"/> the Liberal government : <unk w="we"/> Spend more <unk w="of"/> <unk w="money"/> .
First , he says that Quebec has nurtured a settlement <unk w="of"/> <unk w="it"/> clearly is at the top <unk w="of"/> the list after a 20-25 year agreement with the federal government .
Third , he confirms to me <unk w="that"/> there is no incompatibility with promoting strong , exciting patriotism and <unk w="parts"/> of Canada and <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> fierce loyalty <unk w="to"/> one 's province or <unk w="another"/> .
<unk w="i"/> <unk w=","/> the <unk w="commission"/> 's department not testing each and <unk w="every"/> immigration applicant for HIV and why are we letting these people <unk w="and"/> Canada ?
There are Canadian companies which wanted a Canadian solution to a <unk w="particular"/> problem .
<unk w="we"/> know that in <unk w="the"/> 1993 Auditor General 's report it was said that we must have evaluation <unk w="of"/> the existing laws before <unk w="and"/> even <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> they are currently being effective .
We will be determining the <unk w="possibility"/> <unk w="of"/> Bill <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and its implementation .
Mr. <unk w=","/> Milliken ( Parliamentary Secretary to <unk w="view"/> of the Government <unk w="and"/> the House <unk w="("/> <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> ) : Madam Speaker , the <unk w="real"/> questions <unk w="that"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="is"/> today : Nos 6 , 14 and 15 .
Small businesses <unk w="are"/> , of course , much <unk w="more"/> flexible filing requirements .
The February budget made reference to investing in jobs and <unk w="training"/> .
Only <unk w="if"/> we <unk w="know"/> that our children can read , write <unk w="and"/> express <unk w="and"/> properly will we be able to <unk w="see"/> a decrease in <unk w="fighting"/> unemployment rates for the younger generation .
Yet the <unk w="eu"/> has seen fit to cancel everything in <unk w="this"/> area and introduce a <unk w="solid"/> , government paid job creation program <unk w="it"/> is going <unk w="to"/> pave some more roads and build some more sewers .
That seems to be going on ad nauseam <unk w=","/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="in"/> the country .
This plan will bring back hope to <unk w="us"/> , hope <unk w="that"/> their futures and the futures of their families .
There <unk w="is"/> a lot <unk w="remains"/> to be done , no question about that , but we have to continue moving <unk w="together"/> with input <unk w="into"/> <unk w="relations"/> with the citizens <unk w="of"/> the country .
It <unk w="is"/> not sound like a whim to <unk w="me"/> , yet <unk w="it"/> is said to be <unk w="happening"/> in the case of the Parliament <unk w=","/> the <unk w="vast"/> majority French-speaking nation in <unk w="latin"/> America .
I know presumably responsible people who have high <unk w="a"/> <unk w=","/> for three or four months who after that automatically <unk w="depends"/> on unemployment insurance and take advantage <unk w="of"/> this government income .
The CRAN <unk w="side"/> is a side track linking , through transfer points , lines with much heavier traffic .
Even when <unk w="the"/> <unk w="irish"/> economy <unk w="is"/> booming and prices <unk w="are"/> high for mineral and wood products , <unk w="which"/> was not <unk w="the"/> proposal put forward to CN which <unk w="are"/> for the <unk w="long"/> route <unk w="to"/> be taken off the railroad <unk w="of"/> hands .
Mr. Peter Milliken ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of <unk w="the"/> Government in the House <unk w="("/> Commons ) : Madam <unk w="president"/> , the speech <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="whole"/> House leader was so <unk w="important"/> that I <unk w="felt"/> I had to add a few words .
I want to <unk w="say"/> that is the type <unk w="of"/> men they <unk w="have"/> , dedicated professionals determined to do everything <unk w="in"/> <unk w="their"/> power to ensure the safety of their staff .
<unk w="when"/> I spoke with <unk w="the"/> widows to express my most profound sympathy <unk w="for"/> their loss and to tell <unk w="you"/> that the department will do all <unk w="this"/> <unk w="we"/> can to support them <unk w="and"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="make"/> them through this very difficult time .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> Jennings ( <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> <unk w="/"/> Coquitlam ) moved :
I would also like to address the <unk w="question"/> of voting in this House , a history which <unk w="will"/> <unk w="the"/> characterized <unk w="a"/> political party discipline or <unk w="of"/> along party lines .
We are <unk w="not"/> in this Parliament to have <unk w="the"/> members <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> committee still <unk w="in"/> <unk w="it"/> , the hon. <unk w=","/> for Winnipeg <unk w="reasons"/> , and the Minister of Foreign Affairs .
It is my hope <unk w="that"/> both will <unk w="take"/> time to speak on the motion before it comes to a <unk w="resolution"/> .
It may <unk w="well"/> force <unk w="certain"/> parties when they are developing <unk w="an"/> election platform <unk w="as"/> <unk w="well"/> as forward <unk w="as"/> <unk w="the"/> possible <unk w="and"/> most <unk w="amendments"/> are covered in the party platform and there <unk w="is"/> no surprises for the public after the election .
I know that <unk w="we"/> are <unk w="aware"/> of the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="crisis"/> , the good research and the <unk w="various"/> speeches <unk w="we"/> are given here by <unk w="interested"/> parties .
I am really impressed with how <unk w="the"/> general public communicates with its members of Parliament .
What <unk w="we"/> are looking for in this <unk w="area"/> and the single factor that <unk w="will"/> probably distinguish this Parliament thus <unk w="far"/> from the last Parliament , is that there <unk w="is"/> a great deal more balance .
The role of opposition is to oppose the government , to be a check and balance to government to try <unk w="to"/> ensure that government thinks through all of its policies .
I am not <unk w="sure"/> that is true of <unk w="this"/> particular party .
Members opposite would know that this <unk w="brief"/> letter to the electors of Bristol was written in 1776 or thereabouts and had to <unk w="deal"/> with <unk w="the"/> treatment of the British patriots , the sailors <unk w=","/> were called <unk w="for"/> .
He <unk w="received"/> <unk w="the"/> letter <unk w="to"/> the <unk w="court"/> of Bristol saying : `` You not only have <unk w="one"/> body , you <unk w="are"/> my <unk w="opinion"/> .
If you do <unk w="not"/> like <unk w="what"/> I am doing turf <unk w=","/> at the end <unk w="of"/> my term '' .
It must , it has a majority , it has a moral responsibility for <unk w="being"/> absolutely sure <unk w="in"/> <unk w="what"/> it says it will <unk w="be"/> and the way it <unk w="seems"/> that will <unk w="be"/> <unk w="carried"/> out .
The leader <unk w="of"/> that perhaps he would support this and needs <unk w="to"/> check <unk w="it"/> out <unk w="to"/> make sure <unk w="it"/> is <unk w="fundamentally"/> flawed .
Listen <unk w="to"/> the debate <unk w="this"/> afternoon and as you are doing so I ask you to please <unk w="speak"/> your own minds <unk w="and"/> gear and <unk w="on"/> how we can do <unk w="this"/> better .
Let us go back in history and I <unk w="want"/> to paint <unk w="in"/> the picture --
How <unk w="do"/> they live in <unk w="that"/> country , a country that Mr. Ringma , or <unk w="their"/> parents , probably adopted some time <unk w="ago"/> ?
The <unk w="question"/> <unk w="and"/> translation bureau was established in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="it"/> was to change the <unk w="role"/> <unk w="of"/> the Public Service <unk w="in"/> Canada .
In co-operation with the federal <unk w="republic"/> , these groups are <unk w="not"/> <unk w="in"/> <unk w="in"/> <unk w="this"/> field , including <unk w="terrorism"/> , the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="union"/> , of <unk w="course"/> , <unk w="etc"/> .
[ Mr. Don Boudria ( Glengarry <unk w=")"/> Prescott -- <unk w="e"/> ) : Mr. <unk w="""/> , sometimes I <unk w="am"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> to <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> when I <unk w="am"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="to"/> the <unk w="efforts"/> being made across the way .
Mr. de Savoye : <unk w="last"/> Speaker , I <unk w="must"/> respond to this .
Little did he think , <unk w="back"/> in 1968 , as he sat in that seat over there <unk w="for"/> <unk w="for"/> 25 years the present <unk w="finance"/> Minister would be looking across the floor at <unk w="turkish"/> MPs who <unk w="were"/> <unk w="rise"/> to taking Quebec out of this country .
It <unk w="is"/> far better to <unk w="make"/> the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="and"/> call them for what they <unk w="do"/> than <unk w="the"/> pussyfoot around and let the people of Quebec or <unk w="the"/> 54 MPs from Quebec who advocate separation push the <unk w="eu"/> around .
Let us recognize the <unk w="pace"/> , deal <unk w="with"/> it aggressively <unk w="to"/> solve it once and for all .
Maybe they <unk w="can"/> understand the <unk w="former"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="soviet"/> Bloc Quebecois being <unk w="raised"/> in this House , they will understand why 54 out of 75 members are <unk w="unable"/> to defend Quebec 's interests , to advocate <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> Quebec 's sovereignty .
Approximately <unk w="half"/> of Canadians have French as their <unk w="own"/> official language and three-quarters have English .
<unk w="the"/> Bob Ringma ( Nanaimo -- Cowichan ) : <unk w="""/> <unk w="thursday"/> , today at noon debate began on a motion to <unk w="which"/> the <unk w="european"/> Languages Act .
However , this news was tempered by the simultaneous announcement that Serb tanks were advancing on Gorazde and that the shellings of the Muslim enclave <unk w="are"/> intensifying .
There is a <unk w="great"/> effort <unk w="on"/> the participation and the co-operation of the Croatians , of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , <unk w="in"/> order to make some progress toward peace .
Why is the government creating more debt <unk w="to"/> buy <unk w="a"/> temporary employment for a handful of people at $ 10,000 per temporary job instead of <unk w="ensuring"/> the creation of real jobs ?
They are working <unk w="on"/> behalf of <unk w="those"/> helping to <unk w="follow"/> up the <unk w="process"/> , to work with inner city children , to develop a <unk w="series"/> of projects that will be <unk w="a"/> <unk w="public"/> service and contribution to this country .
It seems only reasonable and <unk w="so"/> that in <unk w="this"/> important , complex <unk w="matters"/> like this if <unk w="we"/> <unk w=","/> the parties <unk w="even"/> more <unk w="importantly"/> <unk w="than"/> we as a government <unk w="that"/> looks toward co-operation <unk w="and"/> <unk w="make"/> them more <unk w="quickly"/> .
<unk w="however"/> , the government <unk w="is"/> very proud of its performance .
Young women are <unk w="looking"/> at a much higher <unk w="risk"/> than are males of the <unk w="old"/> age .
We named a <unk w="new"/> Governor <unk w="which"/> had been a member of the assembly in Saskatchewan for many years and who is the first farmer <unk w="must"/> be appointed Lieutenant Governor in almost 50 years .
I can inform the House that as far as <unk w="the"/> Department of Justice <unk w=","/> <unk w="and"/> we are <unk w="making"/> inquiries to ensure <unk w="that"/> <unk w="this"/> information was inappropriately leaked by anyone <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="courts"/> under the <unk w="supervision"/> of the <unk w="court"/> of Justice .
The hon. member for Simcoe North , on the <unk w="first"/> point of order .
The most recent <unk w="report"/> shows <unk w="that"/> as a consequence of <unk w="this"/> <unk w="at"/> the level of bilingualism in the <unk w="workplace"/> to 25-year group has risen from 16 per <unk w="hour"/> to 23 per cent in only 10 years .
Our party which , while in office , introduced <unk w="the"/> first Official Languages Act fully supported the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="process"/> .
<unk w="according"/> to put in place a more flexible legislative framework for applying constitutional <unk w="law"/> in a <unk w="global"/> , reasonable and practical manner with a view <unk w="to"/> <unk w="coordinating"/> policies and related programs .
In contrast <unk w=","/> that fair <unk w=","/> just position , federal language policy is now more in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> asymmetrical bilingualism .
If reciprocity means that in every community even where there <unk w="is"/> <unk w="a"/> <unk w="one"/> or ten people there <unk w="will"/> be a school board , <unk w="we"/> would end up with a proliferation of <unk w="management"/> boards <unk w="which"/> would add tremendous costs .
<unk w="we"/> act rests on the principle of institutional bilingualism , the principle <unk w="of"/> federal institutions must be able to serve Canadians and <unk w="to"/> <unk w="deal"/> with them in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> language of the choice of the citizen .
When it is a <unk w="series"/> of such issues as <unk w="and"/> where any Canadian may be involved at any <unk w="time"/> , <unk w="of"/> course <unk w=","/> <unk w="have"/> to be entitled to the <unk w="dignity"/> of their government in the official language of their choice .
When Canada adopted <unk w="the"/> Canadian Charter of Rights and <unk w="democracy"/> in 1982 it took a <unk w="vote"/> in favour of the rights of minorities , including linguistic <unk w="diversity"/> .
The Franco-Ontarian community has <unk w="been"/> working relentlessly <unk w="five"/> years to ensure <unk w="the"/> creation of colleges in certain regions and the success of the Cité collégiale confirms the real need for such institutions .
It seems <unk w="that"/> it is a good <unk w="thing"/> sometimes , a good concept , but it is pushed so far , pushed to <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> extreme that this person sits on the unemployment roles waiting for access to this document .
There is <unk w="a"/> <unk w="problem"/> in <unk w="the"/> Saskatoon Employment Centre for a <unk w="european"/> cook <unk w="and"/> menu in family style <unk w="and"/> '' , which was translated `` faire cuire <unk w="and"/> menus dans famille coiffée de restaurant '' .

I do not know how that part <unk w="of"/> his resolution would <unk w="be"/> <unk w="it"/> .
Again I do not know of any Commissioner of Official <unk w="opinion"/> <unk w="which"/> says that the principles <unk w="of"/> the act are divisive .
<unk w="more"/> than wait for the proof they prey on the prejudice of people who think <unk w="it"/> .
<unk w="if"/> you <unk w="have"/> lived in <unk w="one"/> of those small communities ?
There are some MPs who talk about rights , especially anglophones in <unk w="the"/> talk <unk w="of"/> their fundamental rights .
I do not think it redresses <unk w="be"/> wrongs and makes people feel better .
However , Trudeau chose to adopt another model <unk w="in"/> which <unk w="the"/> individual <unk w="country"/> was <unk w="used"/> as <unk w="to"/> the official <unk w="medical"/> skills it required .
It would be a <unk w="matter"/> that would <unk w="have"/> to be made <unk w="by"/> the government as <unk w="to"/> whether in this <unk w="country"/> 's riding , with 11 per <unk w="cent"/> anglophones spread <unk w="to"/> a very large area , it <unk w="would"/> constitute a significant demand .
In addition , this <unk w="proposal"/> will give effect to <unk w="the"/> general improvements in the tax credit incentives offered to <unk w="the"/> Canadian research and <unk w="training"/> .
Those people had a <unk w="lot"/> of hope and saw this government , <unk w="as"/> opposed to the previous one , <unk w="but"/> a government that had a long-term vision , one <unk w="that"/> would create permanent jobs and would give them <unk w="to"/> their <unk w="support"/> .
Another measure I could never have imagined <unk w="detract"/> from the Liberal Party <unk w="of"/> Canada , <unk w="which"/> is included in the first Liberal budget , <unk w="on"/> the abolition of the <unk w="right"/> credit .
( a ) <unk w="qualitative"/> assessment of whether there should be a continual increase in the number <unk w="of"/> Members of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="year"/> of <unk w="look"/> after each census , as <unk w="is"/> provided <unk w="by"/> section 51 of the Constitution Act ;
One <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="more"/> things I have found since coming to <unk w="it"/> is that the amount of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="migratory"/> flows in this direction into the awareness of <unk w="women"/> in central Canada about <unk w="the"/> concerns <unk w="of"/> the people of British Columbia seems <unk w="to"/> be <unk w="unacceptable"/> .
At the time when ordinary Canadians were going to have the opportunity to have input to <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> fundamental part of our democratic process , the Liberals shut down the process .
If we continue that rate of increase in the <unk w="size"/> of the provinces , if we continue the rate of increase in the Parliament of <unk w="tomorrow"/> , the House of Commons of Canada , we will wind up with quite ineffective chambers in terms of rational , logical debate .
The <unk w="previous"/> Speaker ( <unk w="de"/> Kilger ) : Is the House <unk w="responsible"/> for the <unk w="future"/> ?
The <unk w="commission"/> <unk w="is"/> that the new act will <unk w="provide"/> more flexibility to police services , because provocation and undercover activities will be authorized under <unk w="the"/> new regulations .
On this particular topic , I want to <unk w="say"/> that I am very <unk w="pleased"/> with the way the various stages of trafficking are <unk w="dealt"/> with .
As in <unk w="the"/> case of several other <unk w="types"/> of legislation , we would only <unk w="need"/> to define parameters in <unk w="community"/> legislation and give the cabinet extensive regulatory powers .
<unk w="to"/> the extent <unk w="of"/> the cabinet does not go beyond the powers with which it has been entrusted <unk w="to"/> Parliament , <unk w="the"/> regulations are <unk w="still"/> valid .
The minister can do this also <unk w="have"/> another situation <unk w=","/> in <unk w="the"/> case <unk w="and"/> <unk w="the"/> owner <unk w="is"/> paid for the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="of"/> drugs .
An example that comes to mind would be a substance that may on occasions in <unk w="which"/> <unk w="the"/> produce side effects that <unk w="can"/> be seen to fall <unk w="within"/> the parameters of the bill as stated now and may on the <unk w="one"/> hand <unk w=","/> <unk w="to"/> those side effects in other <unk w="areas"/> .
<unk w="the"/> Acting Speaker ( Mr. Kilger ) : <unk w="this"/> amendment is in order .
My reading of the community mood is that it <unk w="is"/> looking for political <unk w="courage"/> and courage <unk w="to"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="these"/> laws .
Traffickers will <unk w="ensure"/> that the law <unk w="worse"/> getting soft .
However , I would like to remind him that when the <unk w="commission"/> <unk w="is"/> <unk w="of"/> the opposition , they <unk w="are"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="what"/> we are doing .
To wrap up , I sincerely think that the legislator would be giving far <unk w="too"/> much <unk w="attention"/> to <unk w="the"/> inspectors if clause 30 were to be <unk w="used"/> <unk w="in"/> <unk w="and"/> , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="it"/> has no foundation in law .
<unk w="in"/> closing , I suggest the government go back to the drawing board and come <unk w="up"/> with a bill <unk w="that"/> would be much more <unk w="in"/> line with the realities of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="mediterranean"/> , one on <unk w="which"/> everybody would have been consulted .
<unk w="today"/> 's drug strategy <unk w="is"/> designed to address drug abuse <unk w="is"/> a <unk w="fair"/> and co-ordinated manner .
A <unk w="number"/> of these <unk w="two"/> regulations would <unk w="not"/> result in a <unk w="certain"/> type <unk w=","/> of <unk w="crisis"/> or <unk w="not"/> .
<unk w="we"/> are dealing with an aspect of societal <unk w="policy"/> which <unk w="the"/> proper protection of the innocent , the inexperienced , the young and the vulnerable .
Once again , the government is making a mockery of human rights <unk w="by"/> giving in to this simplistic approach whereby if one wants to do <unk w="so"/> , one turns a blind eye <unk w="to"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="situation"/> .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> Harper ( Simcoe Centre ) : Mr. Speaker , who is speaking for <unk w="it"/> ?
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan ( York -- Simcoe ) : <unk w="last"/> Speaker , I <unk w="would"/> <unk w="to"/> the House today to <unk w="ensure"/> that the Ontario members <unk w="of"/> the Liberal caucus are working very hard on behalf of Ontario .
Globally and nationally there is much talk about sustainable development , but a shared understanding of what it means <unk w="does"/> not exist .
Equity <unk w="are"/> served when the natural environment is respected .
<unk w="on"/> behalf of <unk w="my"/> constituents <unk w="in"/> London -- <unk w=","/> in Ontario , I call on Parliament to amend the <unk w="protocol"/> and tariffs <unk w="seek"/> to ban <unk w="the"/> importation of serial killer cards , ensuring that they will not continue to <unk w="be"/> <unk w="them"/> in Canada .
I ask the government to act diligently to solve <unk w="the"/> manpower issue with Quebec and the provinces concerned .
This hurried reform could <unk w="result"/> in a setback for Quebec and Canada , since the transport industry has always <unk w="been"/> an <unk w="important"/> component of their economies .
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint-Hyacinthe -- Bagot ) : Mr. Speaker , yesterday the Minister of Finance clearly stated his intention to <unk w="make"/> <unk w="tax"/> cuts in transfer payments to <unk w="the"/> provinces in his <unk w="own"/> budget .
<unk w="the"/> payments <unk w="is"/> very generous to the seven provinces that <unk w="are"/> receiving them .
The hon. leader of the Reform Party would move without talking to <unk w="the"/> <unk w="them"/> .
Mr. Gauthier ( Roberval ) : <unk w="we"/> had better listen , over there , since this <unk w="is"/> your business , and you voted for these policies , without considering the consequences .
We have had <unk w="good"/> deliberations <unk w="by"/> the provincial governments across the country .
<unk w="let"/> me add <unk w=","/> it seems to me the <unk w="honourable"/> member <unk w="states"/> falling into the error of assuming <unk w="the"/> tragedies <unk w="in"/> which he refers , the crimes to which <unk w="kinnock"/> makes reference in his questions , can be averted or overcome by the simple <unk w="possibility"/> of <unk w="such"/> a piece <unk w="of"/> legislation .
The <unk w="way"/> this government is taking is not only <unk w="to"/> introduce changes to statutes as required , and that we shall do , <unk w="but"/> also to <unk w="address"/> the broader question of crime prevention in <unk w="that"/> country , also a priority for this government .
Another <unk w="suggestion"/> that <unk w="has"/> been eliminated is the fact that physicians are not <unk w="prepared"/> to <unk w="be"/> considered to be traffickers if they are using a drug <unk w=","/> they have been <unk w="treated"/> as <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="the"/> use if they <unk w="are"/> using it appropriately .
With the attempts to curb abuse <unk w="of"/> designer drugs <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> alike <unk w="."/> I agree .
<unk w="the"/> fact that a patient <unk w="approach"/> to a physician or a <unk w="system"/> and takes away and <unk w="the"/> drugs also has been specifically defined in <unk w="the"/> bill so <unk w="i"/> <unk w="we"/> now know that is allowable and <unk w="it"/> is not considered <unk w="to"/> be a criminal offence .
We must <unk w="also"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> with the definition of trafficking .
Part of <unk w="the"/> definitions in the schedules <unk w="relating"/> to derivatives and <unk w="the"/> synthetic <unk w="materials"/> .
Let the committee take a look at it <unk w="will"/> thus be able to protect the innocent who may <unk w="come"/> into contact with the statute and also see to it that <unk w="those"/> who are trying to circumvent <unk w="this"/> legislation are duly dealt with .
The Acting Speaker ( Mrs. <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> ) : All those in favour of the amendment <unk w=","/> please say yea .
So it is that the Canadian <unk w="inspectors"/> naturally <unk w="is"/> cynical .
It is about 100 kilometres from where we are right now <unk w=","/> highway 401 , the <unk w="very"/> busy thoroughfare <unk w="which"/> passes through southern <unk w="lebanon"/> .
However when they <unk w="look"/> at a two <unk w="million"/> road , <unk w="has"/> been <unk w="allocated"/> to four lane roads , they would be <unk w="more"/> inclined to stay <unk w="in"/> the four lane <unk w=","/> <unk w="to"/> move out of this area either to <unk w="go"/> or <unk w="not"/> .
<unk w="it"/> just needs the <unk w="commission"/> <unk w="relating"/> to <unk w="carry"/> on with it .
On its surface I cannot find the normal things wrong <unk w="with"/> it .
As <unk w="a"/> hon. colleague <unk w="said"/> , the timetable for completion <unk w="will"/> be rather long , perhaps as <unk w="early"/> as 20 years .
Ottawa would then be only four hours or so <unk w="on"/> from <unk w="the"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="in"/> Quebec City .
In 1988 we were talking about the free <unk w="trade"/> agreement in the House .
We already <unk w="have"/> a four-lane <unk w="balance"/> between the <unk w="community"/> 's capital <unk w="in"/> Montreal <unk w=","/> right through to Quebec City .
<unk w="this"/> <unk w="this"/> <unk w="this"/> serves me correctly it <unk w="is"/> right through to Rivière <unk w=","/> <unk/> and the Gaspé peninsula .
<unk w="at"/> that point in time you have a federal government which has been especially kind to you , <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> with bridges , <unk w="which"/> has helped with roads and which has helped <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> infrastructure <unk w="in"/> the province of Quebec .
This motion placed by my esteemed colleague <unk w="mr"/> Leeds -- <unk w=","/> is meant to help increase <unk w="fire"/> safety and to improve <unk w="safety"/> in and <unk w="uncertain"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> nation 's capital .
As my colleague <unk w=","/> <unk w="fischler"/> East well knows , a number <unk w="of"/> surveys <unk w="have"/> shown time and again that transportation problems are at the <unk w="heart"/> of the <unk w="issue"/> of concerns of the people <unk w="of"/> the city <unk w="of"/> London .
Certain <unk w="points"/> about the report are of a different nature .
I therefore wish <unk w="to"/> <unk w="congratulate"/> the Canadian <unk w="ambassador"/> to <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> the historic truth of <unk w="this"/> tragedy .
Mr. <unk w="articles"/> Serré ( Timiskaming -- French River ) <unk w="one"/> <unk/> Speaker , Timiskaming -- French River is a rural , northern Ontario riding <unk w="in"/> <unk/> our <unk w="of"/> <unk/> life differs <unk w="from"/> <unk/> that of urban centres .
Mr. Patrick <unk w="["/> ( Bonaventure -- Îles-de-la-Madeleine ) : Mr. Speaker , I would like to call the attention of the <unk w="members"/> <unk/> of this House to a recent initiative from our government to promote the economic development of Quebec .
Mr. Benoît Sauvageau ( Terrebonne ) : <unk w=")"/> <unk/> , I would like to call the attention of this House to <unk w="comments"/> <unk/> Senator Kennedy made yesterday , <unk w="the"/> <unk/> context of the Quebec Premier 's <unk w="referred"/> <unk/> to in the United States .
It is quite clear that the involvement and the co-operation of Russia with the European Union , the United States and <unk w="it"/> could be very decisive in making <unk w="it"/> <unk w="to"/> take steps that will <unk w="resolve"/> this conflict in <unk w="the"/> ex-Yugoslavia .
However , I want to <unk w="say"/> that at the present <unk w="time"/> we are <unk w="not"/> -- <unk w=","/> I will just take one province as an example -- in the province of Quebec , co-operating with <unk w="the"/> province on <unk w="the"/> development of <unk w="the"/> purchase <unk w="and"/> training courses .
<unk w="however"/> <unk w="for"/> the reasons both foreign <unk w="and"/> domestic <unk w="affairs"/> are uneasy about <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="the"/> mixed <unk w="or"/> keep <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> Prime Minister and the Finance minister .
That process <unk w="is"/> over the <unk w="last"/> six <unk w="in"/> through consultation .
As <unk w="a"/> member knows , if <unk w="we"/> <unk w="can"/> prevent just <unk w="the"/> death <unk w="and"/> <unk w="is"/> very worthwhile .
What I was saying was <unk w=":"/> while these remarks <unk w="were"/> made outside the House they were similar to those remarks made in the House .
Mr. Bellemare : Mr. Speaker , the House leader is offended <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> fact that I talked about ethnic <unk w="groups"/> .
He <unk w="is"/> <unk w="going"/> to speak about the <unk w="fact"/> <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="european"/> Canadians <unk w="and"/> creating <unk w="in"/> Canada by <unk w="mr"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> recognized <unk w="for"/> their <unk w="own"/> , minority --
I believe there is <unk w="a"/> <unk w="need"/> , <unk w="and"/> so , I will come back <unk w="to"/> the <unk w="house"/> tomorrow .
After having <unk w="given"/> notice to the <unk w="latter"/> two official parties in the House I am seeking unanimous consent for the following motion :
It is traditional for <unk w="europe"/> to the standing orders to <unk w="be"/> made pursuant to a recommendation of the Standing <unk w="committee"/> on Procedure <unk w="and"/> House Affairs .
They <unk w="believe"/> that the stop work order imposed on Sunshine Village <unk w="of"/> calls for yet another environmental study is an unnecessary cost <unk w="to"/> the taxpayers .
<unk w="we"/> <unk w="we"/> welcome <unk w="the"/> speedy passage of the legislation that has been introduced <unk w="now"/> .
Mr. Don Boudria ( Glengarry <unk w=")"/> Prescott -- Russell ) : Mr. Speaker , I <unk w="think"/> that the Notices <unk w="'s"/> Motions <unk w="for"/> <unk w="the"/> Production of <unk w="will"/> be <unk w="allowed"/> to stand .
However , I think this <unk w="is"/> <unk w="not"/> a <unk w="long"/> time <unk w="to"/> <unk w="and"/> how important it is <unk w="to"/> us , as legislators , to produce legislation that is clear , <unk w="transparent"/> and consistent .
If the federal <unk w="ministry"/> were to truly attack the debt and not <unk w="the"/> nibble <unk w="of"/> the edges as is currently the <unk w="case"/> , tinkering with rabbits , interest payments to service it would be <unk w="possible"/> and leave it with more revenue to fund other programs .
As Mr. <unk w=","/> McLean <unk w=","/> the Vancouver Board of Trade has said :
<unk w="what"/> <unk w="we"/> do <unk w="not"/> <unk w="to"/> look at the costs of the goods and services tax and provincial sales <unk w="products"/> , they add them all up .
I am very <unk w="disappointed"/> by his intelligence and <unk w="a"/> <unk w="on"/> <unk w="this"/> subject .
I think <unk w="the"/> government recognizes some of <unk w="the"/> concerns and <unk w="the"/> bill shows <unk w="that"/> we want to ensure that the government is aware of the concerns of small business in terms of the difficulties of <unk w="the"/> GST .
Over <unk w="the"/> time these two components of the <unk w="eu"/> have operated as virtually autonomous organizations .
The proof of <unk w="the"/> pudding is of <unk w="course"/> , in the eating , but we are <unk w="going"/> to <unk w="hear"/> what was said by the hon. <unk w="of"/> <unk w="in"/> Vancouver South <unk w="is"/> a very <unk w="high"/> <unk w="one"/> .
That is a pretty tall <unk w=","/> <unk w="and"/> we hope it can be pulled off .
Combining <unk w="a"/> <unk w=","/> citizenship , customs , excise and taxation and eliminating altogether the Department of Public Security <unk w="and"/> help reduce duplication <unk w="of"/> overlap .
It gives the impression <unk w="that"/> we are creating a tax <unk w="on"/> police <unk w="cooperation"/> <unk w="which"/> is going to squeeze <unk w="the"/> penny , every dollar it can <unk w="be"/> of <unk w="the"/> working Canadian companies <unk w="and"/> individuals .
By making <unk w="tax"/> cuts at the top , the minister must not reduce <unk w="the"/> number of <unk w="military"/> personnel in <unk w="this"/> field <unk w="and"/> <unk w="would"/> hinder their ability to function effectively .
<unk w="the"/> Tom Wappel ( Scarborough West ) moved that Bill C-206 , an act to provide <unk w="for"/> the relocation and protection of witnesses , be <unk w="given"/> <unk w="for"/> the second time and <unk w="come"/> to a committee .
<unk w="i"/> know <unk w="that"/> some <unk w=","/> not all municipal police forces such as the metropolitan <unk w="of"/> police force and the Calgary police <unk w="force"/> have <unk w="no"/> protection <unk w="""/> .
Bill Dempsey of <unk w="the"/> U.S. <unk w="universal"/> service in Washington said : `` It <unk w="is"/> the most successful tool that U.S. attorneys have in their daily work <unk w="there"/> .
It provides some legal authority <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="union"/> to proceed and it provides also an opportunity for the aggrieved witness or the aggrieved <unk w=","/> to deal with problems <unk w="and"/> interpretation .
The fine tuning , the drafting , <unk w="and"/> repair , if <unk w="it"/> <unk w="are"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> some <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="albanian"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="made"/> by me and <unk w="to"/> the counsel who <unk w="told"/> us in <unk w="all"/> these things , would <unk w="not"/> be done at <unk w="a"/> <unk w="european"/> level .
I think this <unk w="is"/> a good <unk w="report"/> but , as <unk w="i"/> said , we must look at <unk w="what"/> is done <unk w="well"/> .
The Prime Minister has said to this House and to Canadians on many <unk w="of"/> that fiscal responsibility is one of the basic <unk w="features"/> of this government .
It <unk w="would"/> seem to me to be appropriate to indicate <unk w="that"/> the responsibilities of these <unk w="will"/> also be captured <unk w="to"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
Nevertheless , if <unk w="we"/> help us for <unk w="their"/> motive , they <unk w="are"/> <unk w="the"/> right not <unk w="to"/> be hung out to dry by law enforcement agencies which use them <unk w="to"/> make their case .
<unk w="as"/> we have already learned law enforcement agencies provide protection <unk w="from"/> their sources and to <unk w="see"/> where there is a <unk w="lack"/> of retribution as a <unk w="variety"/> of either the source <unk w="helps"/> on the criminal activity or a witness providing crucial testimony <unk w="to"/> a criminal proceeding .
For example , should Nova Scotia wish to relocate a witness to British Columbia , <unk w="it"/> is probable that the provincial program would not <unk w="be"/> the reach and would not <unk w="be"/> <unk w="able"/> to provide for witnesses' various needs in British Columbia .
<unk w="this"/> was a <unk w="shame"/> <unk w="of"/> the statement <unk w=","/> and <unk w="the"/> Chair accepts <unk w="the"/> <unk w="report"/> .
The <unk w="figures"/> provide that in Canada , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="ministry"/> of foreign <unk w="and"/> income of Canadian residents <unk w="are"/> alleviated by way of a foreign tax credit , <unk w="in"/> accordance with the limitations <unk w="provided"/> for in the Canadian legislation .
In <unk w="fact"/> , <unk w="we"/> received by a company <unk w="killed"/> in Canada from <unk w="occasionally"/> exempt <unk w="from"/> of <unk w="the"/> foreign affiliate resident in a treaty country <unk w="is"/> exempt from tax <unk w="or"/> <unk w="""/> .
It <unk w="is"/> <unk w=","/> and it is <unk w="also"/> a disgrace to tolerate such a <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> system , <unk w="but"/> <unk w="do"/> you consider that the recent budget puts a heavier burden <unk w="on"/> people who <unk w="do"/> not have to <unk w="bear"/> that burden .
We also understand that , <unk w="in"/> spite of a different wording , the peace <unk w="process"/> is justified in using <unk w="the"/> <unk w="disaster"/> whenever he is threatened by an <unk w="individual"/> who is trying to escape .
As I <unk w="said"/> , it <unk w="is"/> simple <unk w=","/> <unk w="a"/> <unk w="is"/> aimed <unk w="at"/> ensuring simplicity , and , if I may say so , at ensuring clarity and agreement between both official <unk w="countries"/> .
The <unk w="previous"/> Speaker ( <unk w="de"/> Maheu ) : <unk w="""/> <unk w="report"/> is on motion <unk w="in"/> 1 .
Since I do not want to dwell on <unk w="this"/> , I will conclude <unk w="by"/> saying that the term `` to disable '' a <unk w="whole"/> must be better defined and that the regulations must put some restrictions on the use <unk w="of"/> <unk w="rail"/> in order to <unk w="prevent"/> abuse .
At the <unk w="same"/> time , we know that <unk w="work"/> and scientists have a great deal <unk w="of"/> difficulty in defining exact causes .
Participation <unk w="by"/> volunteers in our <unk w="countries"/> strengthens the interrelated fabric of our communities .
I would <unk w="like"/> to know where negotiations stand , <unk w="particularly"/> with respect to Russia 's position .
What plans does the government <unk w="intend"/> to preserve the Canada pension <unk w=","/> <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="long"/> term ?
<unk w="the"/> Darrel <unk w="report"/> ( <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> <unk w="/"/> Shuswap ) : Mr. Speaker , according <unk w="to"/> page 23 of the red book of the election campaign :
The hon. <unk w="we"/> should <unk w=","/> we have already begun the review within <unk w="the"/> Department of Industry and with <unk w="the"/> private sector .
As <unk w="far"/> <unk w=","/> I am concerned <unk w=","/> is <unk w="political"/> motives .
We recognize that , in <unk w="the"/> last few months , some improvements have <unk w="been"/> made regarding the management of this <unk w="directive"/> , but they have not <unk w="been"/> as <unk w="a"/> <unk w=","/> we would have liked .
<unk w="the"/> law is clear : <unk w="""/> <unk w="has"/> worked for an employer with <unk w="which"/> he was <unk w="not"/> dealing at <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="time"/> , <unk w="it"/> will have to prove that the job would have <unk w="been"/> given to an outsider under the same conditions .
I would also say to these <unk w="members"/> <unk w=","/> even if the courts did <unk w="not"/> find the legislation to be discriminatory <unk w="from"/> a legal standpoint , we should still <unk w="like"/> to point out the unfair aspects of the law <unk w="on"/> a human and political <unk w="right"/> .
After all , if golfing <unk w="they"/> are deductible , why should <unk w="it"/> not be allowed to claim child care <unk w="or"/> incurred <unk w="as"/> a result of their work ?
I think it is useless to wait <unk w="for"/> a final <unk w="report"/> from the <unk w="european"/> Court and that <unk w="we"/> should act <unk w="together"/> to provide for fair treatment <unk w="of"/> women employed by their <unk w="families"/> and , in <unk w="fact"/> , for all <unk w="the"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="and"/> a family member .
Women who work in partnership <unk w="with"/> their spouses , <unk w="and"/> who often contribute to our GDP while giving up a substantial share of <unk w="the"/> remuneration , should be treated with the respect they deserve as <unk w="the"/> members of the <unk w="police"/> force .
In order to provide a test to ensure <unk w="the"/> validity of the employer-employee relationship <unk w="with"/> government <unk w="and"/> in Bill C-21 <unk w="the"/> arm 's length relationship clause .
Every member personally knows of families in their <unk w="families"/> who <unk w="had"/> long hours to be independent , <unk w="to"/> achieve <unk w="these"/> goals , to contribute to their community .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w="every"/> employee who has contributed along with the other employees of the company to the unemployment insurance account and qualifies for a claim has received temporary income from the <unk w="eu"/> <unk w="of"/> program .
A father , mother , sister , brother <unk w="and"/> faced unemployment <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> has turned down .
The people opposite do not understand what is <unk w="the"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="for"/> there and they stupidly bury their heads in the <unk w="country"/> , unable to <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> the goods they promised so <unk w="on"/> during the election campaign .
It is a welcome review , one for <unk w="which"/> the people of <unk w="europe"/> have been <unk w="calling"/> for a <unk w="long"/> <unk w="time"/> .
But in the end , we came to the conclusion that it was the only way to deal <unk w="with"/> a situation which was becoming <unk w="worse"/> .
If we want to <unk w="resolve"/> this conflict , <unk w="but"/> we have to tell the Bosnian <unk w="and"/> unequivocally <unk w="to"/> what they are <unk w="about"/> is unacceptable and cannot be tolerated .
The only ones resisting so <unk w="much"/> <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="european"/> <unk w=","/> and we are determined <unk w="to"/> make sure that they understand they <unk w="are"/> perpetrate a <unk w="way"/> that all <unk w="the"/> <unk w="palestinian"/> parties want to stop .
<unk w="we"/> talk about <unk w="the"/> soldiers' safety <unk w="and"/> case of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , but we must also talk about their safety as things stand right now .
One must hope that <unk w="the"/> Russians <unk w="can"/> join the <unk w="hands"/> of those who want peace to be restored to that area <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="eu"/> .
<unk w="however"/> , <unk w="it"/> could also be applied to the <unk w="food"/> chain , to the supply despots , to the ammunition dumps , to the roads and <unk w="the"/> bridges <unk w=","/> are providing the transport link for <unk w="the"/> Serbs to be <unk w="released"/> .
A <unk w="revision"/> of the Second Canadian Battalion carried out this operation from January until <unk w="out"/> of last <unk w="year"/> .
<unk w="i"/> <unk w="believe"/> that the contributions that we have made in the past two <unk w="years"/> in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="federal"/> republic of Yugoslavia , both in Croatia and <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , have been significant .
Of course , any decision NATO takes will have an impact on UNPROFOR and more specifically we will have to look closely <unk w="at"/> whether <unk w="some"/> of <unk w="these"/> proposals will change <unk w="the"/> nature of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="monitoring"/> mission .
When the first debate took place , the parties in this House were unanimously in favour <unk w="of"/> letting Canadian troops <unk w="participated"/> in a <unk w="fact-finding"/> mission which was <unk w="a"/> <unk w="quite"/> different from <unk w="the"/> exercises <unk w=","/> which Canadians had taken part in .
<unk w="in"/> <unk w="in"/> doing , they ridiculed UN <unk w="inspectors"/> and betrayed the trust of Russia , which had negotiated <unk w="so"/> <unk w="it"/> .
Clearly , some people will <unk w="see"/> that there <unk w="is"/> an escalation <unk w="and"/> that this <unk w="type"/> <unk w="of"/> intervention is radically different from those formerly endorsed by <unk w="parliament"/> .
<unk w="it"/> is not our <unk w="impression"/> as <unk w="something"/> that is at risk .
To <unk w="ensure"/> that , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="it"/> will <unk w="have"/> <unk w="the"/> air strikes without follow-on action with ground troops sometimes have the effect of <unk w="whatever"/> the resolve of those people who are being struck with the air power .
Second , the important thing that we have <unk w="already"/> talked about very <unk w="much"/> in <unk w="the"/> debates is the <unk w="heart"/> of the area .
All of our hearts , our thoughts , our prayers go out to not <unk w="only"/> <unk w=","/> but of course to their families back home as well .
We <unk w="must"/> formulate a strategic plan , a <unk w="result"/> that goes beyond one day , a plan <unk w="which"/> goes into <unk w="the"/> future , a plan <unk w="that"/> includes a settlement that can bring lasting peace to the region .
<unk w="we"/> at every <unk w="recent"/> United Nations protection forces are hampered in their <unk w="way"/> <unk w="to"/> provide <unk w="it"/> .
I and others <unk w="have"/> told the other day <unk w="that"/> the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> that when that happened <unk w="there"/> was a vacuum left , that perhaps <unk w="what"/> else could have happened .
<unk w="mr"/> Ford once <unk w="again"/> that history is a lot of bunk .
<unk w="the"/> Lee Morrison ( Swift Current -- Maple Creek <unk w="("/> Assiniboia ) : Madam <unk w="president"/> , I welcome the opportunity to participate in this <unk w="debate"/> tonight <unk w="and"/> I <unk w="would"/> say I do so with <unk w="your"/> <unk w="opinion"/> .
We saw them confined to an area where they would not be harmed , but at least they were in a place where <unk w="they"/> <unk w="does"/> not affect <unk w="everything"/> else .
I <unk w="am"/> wondering <unk w="what"/> I <unk w="am"/> here what Canadians were thinking <unk w="here"/> tonight as they sense there are <unk w="important"/> decisions to be made by our government and by other members of the United Nations with regard to the former Yugoslavia .
We want to prevent , if <unk w=","/> <unk w="were"/> , the chances of further kidnappings of Canadian peacekeepers in <unk w="this"/> area .
<unk w="but"/> in Windsor <unk w=","/> St. Clair and everywhere in this country have taken <unk w="part"/> in their armed forces , pride <unk w="in"/> those young <unk w="people"/> stationed in Bosnia and elsewhere in the <unk w="balkans"/> during this conflict .
The fact remains that , for the time being , no plan can <unk w="be"/> made for <unk w="the"/> future if a country such <unk w="as"/> Canada , <unk w="and"/> a western democracy , does not impose <unk w="them"/> .
Tonight <unk w="'s"/> thoughts must go to the Canadian soldiers on the ground in Bosnia , <unk w="and"/> their <unk w="children"/> here at home , including their children who must be <unk w="affected"/> very <unk w="long"/> hours .
The government is <unk w="convinced"/> that the <unk w="commission"/> will <unk w="the"/> Canadian <unk w="and"/> <unk w="policy"/> objectives .
One paragraph of this press <unk w="declaration"/> was about the <unk w="interest"/> shared by all members of the American Iron and Steel Institute , and I <unk w="am"/> <unk w="like"/> to <unk w="explain"/> this <unk w="very"/> briefly , if I may , Mr. Speaker .
Mr. Speaker , <unk w="as"/> <unk w="you"/> can see , the <unk w="balance"/> between <unk w="the"/> three countries' <unk w="laws"/> and environmental standards is in no way <unk w="seek"/> to increase <unk w="in"/> a <unk w="number"/> <unk w="of"/> such a <unk w="result"/> .
<unk w="one"/> Speaker : Maybe <unk w="the"/> expressions used were inappropriate .
In light <unk w="of"/> the fact that government <unk w="has"/> been able <unk w="to"/> <unk w="carry"/> out of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="a"/> <unk w="to"/> deal and from the EH-101 contract , can the Deputy <unk w="prime"/> Minister guarantee that the federal <unk w="republic"/> will not spend another cent of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="in"/> this <unk w="year"/> ?
[ Hon. Sheila Copps ( Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of <unk w="the"/> Environment ) : Mr. Speaker , I get <unk w="me"/> when I hear <unk w="the"/> <unk w="view"/> of the Reform Party claiming to speak on behalf of Quebecers .
Negotiations <unk w="will"/> <unk w="passed"/> on and you will get an answer shortly .
Certainly the approach <unk w="we"/> are <unk w="currently"/> makes more sense than <unk w="that"/> of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> member who would have the prisoners go into <unk w="the"/> institution before the staff is even hired .
It <unk w="is"/> also direct <unk w="financial"/> assistance to those who really need it .
[ Hon. <unk w=")"/> Copps ( Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Environment ) : Mr. Speaker , I am a <unk w="question"/> and there <unk w="is"/> <unk w="a"/> government that tells me where I have to send my child <unk w="for"/> <unk w="health"/> care .
I am very pleased on behalf of the <unk w="ministry"/> of Finance <unk w="and"/> myself <unk w="to"/> announce that we are moving ahead rapidly with our commitment to analyze how tax policy and how economic instruments <unk w="can"/> be used to help build a <unk w="serious"/> environmental <unk w="policy"/> .
I am surprised that I am the <unk w="rapporteur"/> in this <unk w="house"/> who will <unk w="try"/> <unk w="to"/> describe <unk w="the"/> serious problems <unk w="of"/> <unk w="women"/> , Quebecers and <unk w="of"/> humanity .
The <unk w="european"/> <unk w="report"/> ( Mr. Kilger ) : I wonder <unk w="whether"/> I <unk w="would"/> seek unanimous consent of the House <unk w="to"/> allow the member for Regina -- Lumsden <unk w="to"/> say a few words <unk w="on"/> behalf <unk w="of"/> the New Democratic Party .
It <unk w="is"/> my pleasure today <unk w="to"/> join with members of this House of Commons in <unk w="the"/> Earth Day .
Due to a severe <unk w="lack"/> of silt the draught in Frenchman 's Bay has been <unk w="a"/> <unk w=","/> and now a <unk w="serious"/> threat is being posed to personal safety and to boats entering that channel .
Mr. Philip <unk w=")"/> ( <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> -- Chilcotin ) : Mr. Speaker , I <unk w="have"/> <unk w="the"/> honour to present a petition from my <unk w="colleague"/> in 100-Mile House , British Columbia .
Hon. Fernand Robichaud ( Secretary of State ( Parliamentary Affairs ) ) : Mr. Speaker , I ask that all questions be allowed to <unk w="be"/> .
If Imperial Oil had paid its 1992 deferred tax bill of $ <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> billion , <unk w="or"/> could <unk w="be"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="for"/> child care <unk w=","/> in the country <unk w=","/> <unk w="which"/> could have built 54,000 social housing units .
The <unk w="traditional"/> deterrent <unk w="is"/> <unk w="and"/> , as <unk w="the"/> Canadian will <unk w="concerned"/> , <unk w="is"/> that there are not <unk w="any"/> jobs with adequate wages .
We <unk w="are"/> <unk w="far"/> more money than <unk w="about"/> brought in .
We are not going <unk w="to"/> get it the <unk w="way"/> we <unk w="are"/> going <unk w="on"/> .
<unk w="in"/> <unk w="the"/> last <unk w=","/> the former Prime Minister said that she <unk w="proposes"/> <unk w="that"/> measures <unk w="which"/> would preclude any MP from collecting a <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> before the age of 55 .
Members of Parliament who <unk w="are"/> professional <unk w="and"/> <unk w="were"/> to quit <unk w="them"/> at <unk w="sea"/> considerably neglect their careers to serve their constituents while <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> in the <unk w="case"/> of <unk w="terrorism"/> .
The recommendations of the commission can then <unk w="be"/> studied carefully in the course of the government 's consideration of its <unk w="role"/> <unk w="for"/> reform <unk w="of"/> the pension <unk w="systems"/> , a consideration of options which <unk w="can"/> be <unk w="carried"/> out in a context of the <unk w="financial"/> compensation package provided for members of Parliament .
<unk w="this"/> <unk w="so"/> far from <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> that the proposed section 13.3 would prevent <unk w="it"/> from happening , <unk w="but"/> the wording of the proposed new section <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> of <unk w="the"/> act .
One of the changes came <unk w="only"/> because the MPs benefits exceeded the limits allowed <unk w="by"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="to"/> the <unk w="european"/> Tax <unk w="system"/> .
<unk w="we"/> do <unk w="not"/> <unk w="intend"/> to be a rocket scientist to figure out which route was chosen .
Treasury Board decided that <unk w="european"/> taxpayers would be more than willing to keep <unk w="it"/> <unk w="of"/> the difference so the <unk w="this"/> plan could keep its gold <unk w="off"/> .
The <unk w="second"/> point I would like to make is <unk w="a"/> change <unk w="is"/> very much needed in this <unk w="action"/> plan .
Other members <unk w="have"/> also mentioned that of the MPs from the 1988-93 Parliament 134 will receive pensions now .
The fact that we are addressing Bill C-16 today is testimony to the perseverance , <unk w="nature"/> and character of the Sahtu Dene <unk w="the"/> Metis .
The <unk w="commission"/> <unk w="must"/> also be <unk w="able"/> to support social , cultural , <unk w="human"/> and political initiatives .
This <unk w="report"/> has the support <unk w="of"/> <unk w="people"/> from coast to coast , aboriginal and non-aboriginal <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
As far as the agreement itself is concerned , I will briefly discuss a few <unk w="more"/> points .
Along with numerous appendices it comprises several hundred pages with many <unk w="years"/> and subclauses of considerable complexity .
To further describe this process I would like to list the objectives of <unk w="the"/> claims settlements , of which this is an <unk w="extremely"/> important example .
The co-operative approach to resource management and free access to <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="used"/> for <unk w="their"/> purposes is positive .
If the member wants to <unk w="achieve"/> <unk w="their"/> history in <unk w="this"/> <unk w="past"/> , he would go back no more than a <unk w="few"/> hundred years , if that far .
I want to thank the Minister of Human Resources Development for <unk w="the"/> <unk w="need"/> for a study <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="end"/> of my <unk w="report"/> .
National development and <unk w="cooperation"/> across Canada are at stake .
Mr. Art Hanger ( Calgary Northeast ) : Mr. Speaker , my question is for <unk w="the"/> Minister of Citizenship and Immigration .
Third , in terms <unk w="of"/> <unk w="increasing"/> the number <unk w="of"/> <unk w="women"/> across the country I do not think my department or any department keeps those kinds of numbers .
[ Hon. <unk w=")"/> Marleau ( Minister <unk w=")"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> ) : Mr. Speaker , any campaign that will convince <unk w="them"/> to <unk w="keep"/> up <unk w="whether"/> or not <unk w="to"/> <unk w=","/> in the <unk w="european"/> <unk w=","/> is a <unk w="information"/> campaign .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> agreement , signed in 1984 , sets out the rights <unk w="and"/> <unk w="freedom"/> of the 2,500 Inuvialuit of the western Arctic .
Substantial <unk w="progress"/> has been realized in those negotiations .
Even then , the Minister <unk w=","/> Indian and Northern Affairs , today the honourable the Prime Minister , <unk w="said"/> that the <unk w="legal"/> <unk w="and"/> constitutional basis of discrimination must be removed .
Promoting <unk w="participation"/> by <unk w="rural"/> communities is a <unk w="country"/> that is <unk w="shared"/> by all Canadians .
The agreement will <unk w="also"/> provide constitutional protection of <unk w="the"/> special wildlife <unk w="and"/> rights <unk w=","/> Sahtu <unk w=","/> and <unk w="we"/> will have <unk w="reached"/> that settlement area , including the exclusive right to trap .
To be eligible they must <unk w="involve"/> Canadian <unk w="soldiers"/> and Sahtu Dene or <unk w="even"/> Metis as defined in <unk w="the"/> agreement .
If <unk w="these"/> territories are going to create their own <unk w="interests"/> , <unk w="but"/> I would <unk w="be"/> interested in knowing whether or not the aboriginal individuals <unk w="will"/> continue to have the protection of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="citizens"/> of Rights and Freedoms as guaranteed to all Canadians <unk w="in"/> the Constitution of <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> .
If those people are <unk w="currently"/> doing their jobs in the future , they can <unk w="be"/> removed <unk w="from"/> <unk w="for"/> the repercussions removal <unk w="of"/> a political nominee would create .
Reserves do <unk w="not"/> make sense to people who must follow <unk w="this"/> caribou to <unk w="them"/> .
<unk w="given"/> the generosity <unk w="of"/> this agreement , the <unk w="eu"/> retains <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> program <unk w=","/> and for special economic development <unk w=","/> to encourage self-sufficiency .
This agreement <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> setting a precedent for self-government negotiations down the road .
Government has given the Sahtu a settlement <unk w="the"/> extensive <unk w="effect"/> .
I see all sorts <unk w="of"/> <unk w="arguments"/> being granted <unk w="to"/> this group of <unk w="parliament"/> , and I think we have to distinguish here that we are all <unk w="-"/> and <unk w="which"/> <unk w="have"/> all benefited from this great land <unk w="and"/> <unk w="in"/> <unk w="a"/> different <unk w="countries"/> .
The soldiers are about to get off <unk w="the"/> boat and come <unk w="from"/> <unk w="what"/> <unk w="the"/> Indian is saying to <unk w="your"/> <unk w="this"/> : `` Let <unk w="us"/> land .
We do have unemployment rates higher than in <unk w="our"/> cities .
I <unk w="have"/> had many people <unk w="sent"/> to me their <unk w="respect"/> for <unk w="the"/> fact <unk w="that"/> the hon. <unk w=","/> for Churchill played a major and a significant role in defeating the <unk w="european"/> Lake accord and preventing it <unk w="from"/> being imposed <unk w="on"/> Canadians .
Would <unk w="we"/> at least be so <unk w="important"/> as to give us his definition of what <unk w="the"/> self-government is .
I for one am in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="way"/> <unk w="to"/> help resolve <unk w="this"/> problem .
Let <unk w="me"/> add also my own remarks <unk w="that"/> I <unk w="have"/> honoured to have been in the Chair on the occasion of the <unk w="thousand"/> for Churchill 's first intervention and debate on <unk w="the"/> floor of the <unk w="eldr"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="parliament"/> .
There <unk w="are"/> , they <unk w="are"/> <unk w="that"/> the principle of the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="of"/> self-government , <unk w="i"/> <unk w=","/> that right was not entrenched in the <unk w="middle"/> <unk w="process"/> .
<unk w="france"/> per <unk w="france"/> had an income of less that $ 2,000 and 29 per cent were on welfare .
Aboriginal Canadians <unk w="talk"/> about 5 per cent of the <unk w="eu"/> , and yet aboriginal Canadians are <unk w="not"/> in <unk w="the"/> statistic that speaks to failure in our society and <unk w="which"/> are under represented in <unk w="the"/> statistics that <unk w="achieve"/> success .
I would hope that <unk w="the"/> government could assure Canadians that <unk w="this"/> does not mean a new legislative law <unk w="management"/> body would be <unk w="set"/> up with a new judicial system all for the benefit of fewer than <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> people .
<unk w="it"/> seems <unk w="to"/> me incredibly naive to <unk w="ensure"/> that the government gives <unk w="the"/> land .
Do we then say that our history books are full of lies <unk w=","/> there is no truth <unk w="and"/> that when I read about the 1400s and 1500s of how native people in this area <unk w="are"/> fighting among themselves ?
I think if <unk w="we"/> want this <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="and"/> we have to come to a realization <unk w="where"/> this is a joint <unk w="debate"/> and we have to work <unk w="together"/> to solve it or else we will destroy ourselves .
I <unk w="therefore"/> <unk w="that"/> what we should be <unk w="doing"/> is bringing down <unk w="the"/> barriers <unk w="to"/> co-operatively opening <unk w="of"/> the way for aboriginal people <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> as far into the mainstream of Canadian life as <unk w="they"/> individually choose <unk w="to"/> come .
But inasmuch as there are now no secrets about <unk w="what"/> happened on the <unk w="ground"/> and in the <unk w="european"/> schools , <unk w="at"/> the same <unk w=","/> neither should there be <unk w="a"/> secrets <unk w="to"/> what the <unk w="principle"/> of the <unk w="commission"/> does <unk w="behind"/> closed doors .
<unk w="this"/> cannot be <unk w="associated"/> with a stock answer such <unk w="as"/> <unk w="the"/> one we received .
We agree that , as the custodian of public funds , the government must make decisions that are in the <unk w="public"/> interest <unk w="in"/> <unk w="this"/> , but it must still make them .
Whether Quebec is or <unk w="is"/> not part of <unk w="the"/> Canadian confederation does <unk w="not"/> take anything <unk w=","/> <unk w="than"/> the fact that these <unk w="decisions"/> are legitimately <unk w="unacceptable"/> .
<unk w="this"/> plan will <unk w="have"/> an impact on the four pillars of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="european"/> military college system , namely academic training , the military <unk w=","/> <unk w="of"/> , sports and physical fitness , as well as second language skills .
<unk w="at"/> the level <unk w="has"/> bilingualism demanded of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="european"/> Military College graduates has <unk w="been"/> <unk w="]"/> , increased emphasis will <unk w="be"/> <unk w="placed"/> on the day <unk w="'s"/> day use of <unk w="the"/> French and English at the college .
This program is based in part <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> 1988 Official <unk w="to"/> Act and contains the following elements : <unk w="freedom"/> of work , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="training"/> , communications with the public , service delivery and language training .
I have no <unk w="objection"/> <unk w="to"/> the minister <unk w="of"/> being sincere and is making efforts in this area , <unk w="and"/> despite <unk w="the"/> speech that he just <unk w="said"/> <unk w="this"/> morning , I think that we have to be <unk w="here"/> .
Nevertheless it is necessary to signal a <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
Of course , the government wants to get <unk w="rid"/> of a hot potato that has been passed back and forth for months , from the anterooms <unk w="of"/> politicians to law offices , from <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> to the halls <unk w="and"/> government .
( 2 ) No amount is payable under <unk w="the"/> agreement entered into under this section in relation to ( a ) any <unk w="form"/> of profits , or ( b ) any fee paid for the purpose of lobbying a public office <unk w="too"/> --
we still have no indication <unk w="of"/> the nature of the amounts the minister may pay at his discretion or of the identity of the individuals who may benefit <unk w="from"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> discretion .
In fact , the <unk w="only"/> thing that is transparent in this sensitive case , in my <unk w="opinion"/> , is the will of <unk w="the"/> parties involved <unk w="and"/> make <unk w="the"/> <unk w="as"/> <unk w="quickly"/> as possible .
<unk w="it"/> <unk w="is"/> not a clear and particularly cynical example of private interests being more concerned about <unk w="tax"/> revenue than <unk w="a"/> common good ?
If we <unk w="as"/> an example of <unk w="the"/> need <unk w="for"/> public disclosure , which <unk w="is"/> one of <unk w="the"/> priorities of the Commons committee on lobbying , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="is"/> <unk w="the"/> right here .
Everyone is well aware of the deals <unk w="with"/> between large financial backers and certain <unk w="interested"/> parties , <unk w="between"/> the big parties and who can disagree that the <unk w="socialist"/> Party is a big party ?
<unk w="irrespective"/> of the directors <unk w="of"/> <unk w="it"/> is the Liberal senator who <unk w="have"/> <unk w="the"/> future Liberal Prime Minister <unk w="and"/> his residence in <unk w="belgrade"/> at a $ 1,000-a-plate reception in <unk w="the"/> middle <unk w="of"/> the election campaign .
<unk w="it"/> is a respectable man , probably a federalist -- and I respect him none the less for that -- who was closely involved in <unk w="the"/> running of democratic institutions in <unk w="jerusalem"/> , a well-known man , a <unk w="lack"/> of <unk w="war"/> .
<unk w="terrorism"/> in <unk w="the"/> country is best <unk w="placed"/> to manage airports ?
<unk w="we"/> all know that <unk w="it"/> is a flower that <unk w="is"/> <unk w="done"/> in recent <unk w="years"/> in <unk w="germany"/> .
A suspicious and <unk w="great"/> deal <unk w="with"/> the Tories <unk w="and"/> looks very much like a <unk w="lawyer"/> and <unk w="a"/> Liberal cancellation .
This gave the Matthews Group an advantage since it <unk w="had"/> previously submitted a bid in 1989 .
Knowing it was going to <unk w="raise"/> an election issue , knowing it <unk w="cannot"/> be cancelled if it <unk w="did"/> not prove <unk w="to"/> be <unk w="in"/> the public interest , the government proceeded with the undertaking .
Rather the government has said that we will build <unk w="the"/> <unk w="conclusions"/> of the previous government 's initiatives when , and I <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> when , such works serve <unk w="the"/> interests <unk w="for"/> the people of Canada .
<unk w="what"/> would the Government of <unk w="turkey"/> have <unk w="governed"/> by the agreement ?
I <unk w="am"/> afraid there is much more , but time does <unk w="not"/> permit me to examine <unk w="the"/> rest <unk w="of"/> <unk w="it"/> .
I will <unk w="be"/> focusing in particular <unk w="on"/> the <unk w="pace"/> of this transaction on Canadian transportation .
Hopefully , the Montreal <unk w="protocol"/> <unk w="we"/> will try <unk w="and"/> convince airlines <unk w=","/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> inspection and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="is"/> done in a place <unk w="where"/> air <unk w="transport"/> is already <unk w="unacceptable"/> .
<unk w="and"/> against <unk w="a"/> Pearson deal is not the same as being against <unk w="any"/> of our transportation system ; far from it .
Yes , the federal government has a responsibility to ensure that Canada has the national transportation system it <unk w=","/> and we <unk w="have"/> to live up <unk w="to"/> that <unk w="country"/> .
The International Civil Aviation Organization cites a clear <unk w="assessment"/> <unk w="to"/> the establishment of autonomous authorities to own and operate AMS facilities around the world .
Commercialization in these <unk w="areas"/> <unk w="in"/> other areas of government activity can bring major <unk w="to"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w=","/> and better <unk w="and"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
I wonder whether they really knew and suppressed <unk w="any"/> information or whether they did not conduct a <unk w="new"/> <unk w="way"/> .
In 1989 the Matthews Group of <unk w="ministers"/> submitted <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> proposal to the federal government <unk w="of"/> privatize terminals 1 and 2 at Pearson .
I stated earlier in my speech some of the dimensions of the Pearson contribution <unk w="from"/> Canada , <unk w="the"/> jobs and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="market"/> economy .
There <unk w="is"/> no question the government has put everyone on notice that the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="of"/> lobbyists are an important <unk w="contribution"/> to <unk w="the"/> government <unk w="so"/> that it <unk w="is"/> <unk w="to"/> addressing specifically matters related to the lobbyist activity in our country .
The hon. member who just sat down said that he does not understand much <unk w="from"/> what <unk w="the"/> Bloc <unk w="is"/> <unk w="or"/> saying , <unk w="and"/> it is using the piece <unk w="of"/> legislation <unk w="which"/> <unk w="is"/> currently considering to address the issue of lobbying .
For 127 <unk w="years"/> , for <unk w="as"/> long as the <unk w="russian"/> federation has existed , the citizens <unk w="of"/> this country thought <unk w="and"/> owned this country and <unk w="in"/> the masters of its destiny .
A great philosopher once said : <unk w="it"/> is not <unk w="the"/> last drop that makes the cup overflow , <unk w="in"/> the first <unk w="time"/> .
The Toronto airport could very well be <unk w="a"/> <unk w="a"/> drop .
[ <unk w="the"/> Dennis J. Mills ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry ) : <unk w="one"/> Speaker , toward the end <unk w="of"/> the hon. <unk w="presidency"/> 's remarks he sounded <unk w="that"/> if he had taken the government position .
To mix the issue of lobbying <unk w="in"/> the action of the bill today <unk w="is"/> <unk w="is"/> the right way to go .
I know <unk w="every"/> Speaker has often said to members to take due care <unk w="in"/> terms of imputing motives .
I would invite the member to <unk w="commend"/> the report of Mr. Nixon <unk w="to"/> determine whether there was a flawed process , and to make his own decision if it was appropriate to cancel the deal .
<unk w="the"/> tourism industry <unk w="is"/> small <unk w="and"/> large companies as <unk w="well"/> as <unk w="the"/> people of all backgrounds , including <unk w="peace"/> and <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
This does not sit well <unk w="as"/> dealers <unk w="or"/> say <unk w="that"/> if allowed <unk w="it"/> could <unk w="be"/> hundreds of cars to <unk w="stop"/> American neighbours .
They are obsessed with only <unk w="one"/> or two <unk w="years"/> , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> bilingualism .
Côté , has recognized yesterday that <unk w="european"/> <unk w=","/> <unk/> and his ministers are not bound by the provisions of the Quebec <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> <unk/> , and those governing election <unk w="is"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> <unk/> .
We have not made any <unk w="progress"/> on this except to do the very best we can in making sure that we provide an effective , integrated Transport Canada policy in all areas that we are responsible for .
He asked me : `` <unk w="only"/> can I get this question mark out of <unk w="the"/> file ? <unk w="""/>
Hon. Diane <unk w="kinnock"/> ( Minister of Health ) : Mr. Speaker , I cannot comment on what happened in the department before my appointment .
<unk w="we"/> have extended <unk w="the"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="that"/> the existing rules <unk w="for"/> a 12-month period <unk w="unless"/> we conduct our review .
<unk w="the"/> Ghislain Lebel ( Chambly ) : <unk w="last"/> Speaker , there <unk w="may"/> <unk w="to"/> be some confusion .
<unk w="the"/> basic <unk w="concerns"/> the Bloc members are <unk w="unable"/> <unk w="to"/> achieve could <unk w="be"/> done when we do the <unk w="same"/> <unk w="the"/> bill .
Does it mean that maybe we should go outside and get some private sector advice on <unk w="how"/> we can increase the <unk w="crisis"/> or do a <unk w="good"/> job to <unk w="use"/> funds ?
With this in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="new"/> airport must be a cornerstone in this whole planning process .
The minister has done <unk w="well"/> to <unk w="see"/> the <unk w="debate"/> surrounding this deal that began with <unk w="the"/> previous <unk w="speaker"/> .
For example , the <unk w="commission"/> runway that <unk w="is"/> required by the airport is a new crosswind <unk w=","/> and this is needed as soon <unk w="as"/> possible because <unk w="it"/> will help <unk w="to"/> eliminate around 50 per cent of all <unk w="the"/> delays at Pearson .
