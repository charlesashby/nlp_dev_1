( SK ) The current <unk w="economic"/> crisis is <unk w="not"/> projected into <unk w="the"/> economic crisis .
Furthermore , in view of <unk w="the"/> shortage of <unk w="financial"/> credit , there is a <unk w="lack"/> of energy and food crises .
In <unk w="order"/> to <unk w="say"/> at least the current level of energy production , <unk w="there"/> will be a need by 2030 for worldwide investment of about USD <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> billion <unk w="for"/> reconstruction and the development of <unk w="the"/> oil and gas fields and also in the production and distribution of all types of <unk w="transport"/> .
At the same time it will be necessary to <unk w="give"/> the <unk w="safety"/> <unk w="of"/> oil , gas and electricity so as to create an efficient and <unk w="transparent"/> <unk w="legal"/> system .
<unk w="this"/> system must help <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> consequences <unk w="of"/> local political disputes and <unk w="the"/> consequences <unk w="of"/> any natural disasters and <unk w="to"/> provide for a functioning <unk w="outermost"/> supply in a Europe-wide context .
The Slovak Republic itself has <unk w="had"/> <unk w="the"/> opportunity <unk w="in"/> recent weeks to experience the complexity of such a situation <unk w="and"/> , as a result of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia , not a single cubic metre of gas reached <unk w="accounts"/> for several days .
The experience of <unk w="experience"/> and also of other European countries has shown that vigorous <unk w="action"/> is needed for the <unk w="top"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="a"/> priority of interconnecting and <unk w="on"/> the separate energy markets in Europe .
However , I must mention that the enforced and premature <unk w="approach"/> <unk w="of"/> two reactors at the Jaslovské Bohunice nuclear power plant <unk w="has"/> been found <unk w="in"/> <unk w="such"/> an imprudent mistake in the current <unk w="situation"/> .
<unk w="the"/> decommissioning was <unk w="approved"/> by the European Commission in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="maastricht"/> Treaty as the price for Slovakia 's accession to the European Union .
This <unk w="would"/> <unk w="has"/> weakened <unk w="by"/> <unk w="of"/> self-sufficiency not only of Slovakia , but also of the <unk w="european"/> Union .
( EL ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the battle against climate change and <unk w="the"/> need for energy security and to <unk w="improve"/> the competitiveness of <unk w="the"/> economy are taking us down the road of the third industrial revolution , <unk w="in"/> an era <unk w="in"/> which we wean <unk w="better"/> off mineral fuels .
It <unk w="is"/> a real revolution which <unk w="can"/> bring about <unk w="a"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> to the <unk w="manufacture"/> of production and consumption and , ultimately , to our very <unk w="quality"/> of life .
I trust that , <unk w="in"/> the European <unk w="union"/> , we shall maintain global leadership in this revolution .
In order <unk w="to"/> <unk w="this"/> <unk w="to"/> happen , we shall need to make every possible <unk w="effort"/> to limit <unk w="the"/> energy intensity of the economy in all <unk w="sectors"/> .
One of the tools for improving energy <unk w="management"/> is to make use of the potential of information and communication technologies ( <unk w="communication"/> ) .
Considerable incentives are needed in order <unk w="for"/> us to make use of these technologies , so that we increase the <unk w="overall"/> efficiency of the <unk w="european"/> Union <unk w=","/> <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> % <unk w="of"/> <unk w="women"/> , <unk w="within"/> the framework <unk w="of"/> the 20-20-20 target .
The motion which we are being called on to adopt in a couple of days ' time and which relates to the strengthening <unk w="of"/> energy efficiency through ICT <unk w="with"/> particular emphasis on research and development <unk w=","/> pioneering technologies , such as nano-technologies <unk w="and"/> photonic technology , which have high <unk w="results"/> to improve energy efficiency , and on designing policies <unk w="to"/> strengthen the take-up of <unk w="new"/> technologies .
Similarly , it also gives <unk w="an"/> impetus to <unk w="the"/> green innovation and entrepreneurship , with a series <unk w="of"/> measures <unk w="in"/> <unk w="etc"/> .
I would <unk w="like"/> <unk w="in"/> particular <unk w="the"/> green public procurements , which will allow <unk w="public"/> sector agencies to play a leading role in saving energy by making use of the new technological <unk w="forms"/> of ICT .
Finally , the motion provides for incentives for smart and integrated energy management <unk w="management"/> in <unk w="european"/> cities and for <unk w="the"/> <unk w="crisis"/> management systems with more rational road <unk w="safety"/> and transport <unk w="policy"/> .
It is <unk w="clear"/> from <unk w="what"/> I have said that , although it is not legislative , this motion which we shall vote <unk w=","/> in a <unk w="couple"/> of days ' <unk w="time"/> is <unk w="a"/> <unk w="'"/> , because <unk w="it"/> essentially makes ICT one of the main <unk w="aspects"/> of <unk w="sustainable"/> development in the European Union .
I therefore call on you <unk w="to"/> <unk w="that"/> it <unk w="to"/> the vote in a couple of days ' time .
( DE ) Mr President , <unk w="there"/> are , I hope , all <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> on what the <unk w="candidates"/> are here : <unk w="the"/> <unk w="transport"/> , energy saving and renewable energy .
Nevertheless , we cannot get round the fact that we <unk w="are"/> <unk w="have"/> to worry <unk w="about"/> our gas supplies <unk w="and"/> <unk w="the"/> more years yet .
<unk w="however"/> , what lessons <unk w="do"/> we learn from the dispute between <unk w="them"/> and <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , and <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="fact"/> that <unk w="comes"/> from <unk w="the"/> dispute ?
In my <unk w="opinion"/> - and I am sorry to have to say this , <unk w="however"/> - it seems <unk w="to"/> me that we will be no better , or <unk w="at"/> least not much better , prepared <unk w="to"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="as"/> <unk w="what"/> happens .
Neither <unk w="can"/> it be said that the crisis is over , and I have seen little sign that a <unk w="report"/> is <unk w="not"/> being developed , or that <unk w="the"/> conclusions have <unk w="been"/> drawn <unk w="from"/> this dispute <unk w="between"/> Ukraine and Russia .
Certain <unk w="elements"/> of this <unk w="house"/> <unk w="is"/> that we should conclude bilateral agreements with <unk w="them"/> , but it <unk w="must"/> be pointed out that <unk w="we"/> <unk w="have"/> to bear <unk w="the"/> least <unk w="some"/> of the blame <unk w="for"/> the situation that arose <unk w="here"/> , and I would <unk w="ask"/> rather not <unk w="to"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="debate"/> on arguments between <unk w="the"/> Yushchenko <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> Tymoshenko , or <unk w="the"/> Yanukovych , <unk w="or"/> whoever .
Ukraine <unk w="reform"/> , quite naturally , clearly much <unk w="to"/> buy the gas from Russia and then sell it on to us , <unk w="but"/> for an <unk w="absolute"/> charge , as would <unk w="result"/> in relation to Nabucco , <unk w="and"/> I will return <unk w="to"/> that later .
If , then , we <unk w="want"/> our gas to be just as insecure , but more expensive , we should make a bilateral agreement but , if we want to find a real solution , we need to make a trilateral <unk w="of"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w=","/> as the <unk w="commission"/> , <unk w="such"/> as the transit country and ourselves , and come to an agreement <unk w="in"/> this connection , <unk w="and"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="of"/> transit and infrastructure .
I <unk w="have"/> heard <unk w="yesterday"/> from the Commission on this or <unk w="to"/> what <unk w="the"/> suggestions it has .
With regard to investments in infrastructure , <unk w="when"/> we look to the east , there are <unk w="still"/> three pipelines <unk w="topics"/> for discussion : Nord Stream , South Stream and <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
Nord Stream is a <unk w="new"/> pipeline in the <unk w="future"/> ; <unk w="the"/> solves <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> problem , but will <unk w="also"/> reduce our dependency <unk w="on"/> Russia .
South Stream may also <unk w="be"/> a transit <unk w="deal"/> , but again will not reduce our dependency on Russia .
On top of that , if one looks at the <unk w="nordic"/> <unk w="populations"/> , South Stream <unk w="is"/> actually somewhat more <unk w="often"/> than Nabucco , at least <unk w="to"/> <unk w="in"/> a number <unk w="of"/> studies , which suggests that we need to invest massively in Nabucco .
When I consider - and I have mentioned this on a few previous occasions as <unk w="well"/> , Commissioner - how quickly the <unk w="member"/> States constructed the <unk w="olympic"/> oil pipeline <unk w=","/> how long we are <unk w="going"/> over <unk w="the"/> Nabucco <unk w="the"/> pipeline , I really <unk w="cannot"/> think it is scandalous how little Europe has achieved : <unk w="this"/> <unk w="is"/> a sign of our weakness .
We need to act quickly , not just <unk w="with"/> regard to Azerbaijan or Turkmenistan - which we will be <unk w="very"/> <unk w="high"/> - but also in <unk w="indonesia"/> <unk w="of"/> Iraq .
The fact that gas <unk w="from"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="not"/> being released into <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> as exhaust , with no consideration being given <unk w="to"/> how <unk w="it"/> <unk w="can"/> be transported to <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> pipeline , <unk w="it"/> is a big mistake .
I would ask you , Commissioner , to <unk w="arrive"/> quickly <unk w=","/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="to"/> Turkey , in order to ensure <unk w="that"/> we also <unk w="want"/> their agreement to <unk w="it"/> .
<unk w="it"/> will , of <unk w="course"/> , also <unk w="try"/> to convince Cyprus <unk w="that"/> <unk w="and"/> blocking the energy chapter : their insistence that we cannot even <unk w="agree"/> <unk w="in"/> this chapter shows a <unk w="lack"/> of solidarity , because it <unk w="is"/> naturally <unk w="be"/> <unk w="cooperation"/> with Turkey .
You are nodding , <unk w="however"/> ; I see <unk w="that"/> we are in <unk w="complete"/> agreement here .
Turning finally to nuclear energy , there are <unk w="also"/> very different opinions on this <unk w="issue"/> in <unk w="this"/> House .
Unfortunately , I too cannot vote in favour of the Laperrouze report , <unk w="for"/> example because it is too one-sided in this respect .
The thing that <unk w="concerns"/> me about <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> is that we now have a new development in France , namely a reduction in atomic <unk w="energy"/> , but , when you look more closely , you find <unk w="that"/> this atomic waste is more radioactive .
That is not the way to solve the <unk w="problem"/> , particularly with <unk w="regard"/> to waste .
We will need to <unk w="do"/> a lot more energy and <unk w="approaches"/> to solving <unk w="the"/> <unk w="problem"/> of waste <unk w="and"/> <unk w="etc"/> .
( PL ) Mr President , the energy crisis has revealed a weakness <unk w="in"/> the European Union .
We are still having problems correctly <unk w="with"/> the political challenges <unk w="and"/> <unk w="in"/> this situation .
A glaring illustration of this <unk w="report"/> is the <unk w="case"/> <unk w="of"/> Angela <unk w=","/> who , after a <unk w="renewable"/> energy crisis , is <unk w="up"/> to us <unk w=","/> still <unk w="have"/> ties with Russian energy <unk w="than"/> by building the northern and southern <unk w="mediterranean"/> pipelines .
This crisis shows that <unk w="we"/> should <unk w="do"/> everything on the building <unk w="of"/> an <unk w="important"/> infrastructure <unk w="that"/> will <unk w="enable"/> us to independent sources of <unk w="the"/> raw materials for energy in Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan .
The crisis shows that we should <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> <unk w="the"/> northern gas pipeline off the list of European Commission priorities <unk w="in"/> <unk w="order"/> to avoid a Russian <unk w="conflict"/> in <unk w="germany"/> .
Solving the energy problem <unk w="is"/> <unk w="at"/> a critical moment in the entire <unk w="peace"/> process .
<unk w="the"/> EU <unk w="has"/> <unk w="a"/> chance <unk w="to"/> show its effectiveness and to gain new strength .
( <unk w="es"/> ) Mr President , I would like to <unk w="speak"/> about the need to fuse the <unk w="new"/> technology revolution of the information society with the energy <unk w="sector"/> , <unk w="which"/> has been the subject <unk w="of"/> an excellent resolution of the House .
<unk w="we"/> need smart electricity grids ; <unk w="and"/> these are <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
We need <unk w="something"/> that is managed in accordance <unk w="with"/> production .
This smart consumption can only <unk w="be"/> provided by <unk w="the"/> Internet and only <unk w="on"/> <unk w="the"/> fusion of all electrical networks with the information coming <unk w="from"/> houses , <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , buildings and <unk w="so"/> on .
In <unk w="this"/> way <unk w="we"/> could <unk w="be"/> much <unk w="more"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , much <unk w="more"/> independent , <unk w="that"/> Europe could take a leading role in this essential global issue so that there would not have to be dozens of unnecessary power stations <unk w="as"/> is the case <unk w="today"/> .
The <unk w="most"/> <unk w="developing"/> countries produce three times more energy than is consumed because production is oriented to peak consumption .
Smart grids would <unk w="allow"/> us to adjust <unk w="them"/> to <unk w="community"/> production and to existing production levels .
In <unk w="this"/> way we could <unk w="also"/> cooperate with neighbouring countries in <unk w="the"/> Mediterranean .
An extensive , clean , smart grid is needed to <unk w="go"/> to our neighbours <unk w="in"/> the south who <unk w="have"/> the <unk w="maghreb"/> to generate solar <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> high technology and large-scale plants .
This would be <unk w="a"/> <unk w="the"/> opportunity <unk w="for"/> cooperation on technology transparency .
<unk w="mr"/> President , I should like to thank the rapporteur <unk w="for"/> her work .
Let me make a few points on the <unk w="renewable"/> Energy Review and the last energy <unk w="on"/> <unk w="directive"/> , <unk w="which"/> <unk w="are"/> closely linked .
My first point : in our report , which calls on the Member States <unk w="to"/> speak with a single European voice on energy issues , we have explicitly stated <unk w="that"/> all Europeans <unk w="to"/> <unk w=","/> in the <unk w="coming"/> weeks <unk w="will"/> be the <unk w="case"/> , <unk w="and"/> that <unk w="renewable"/> energy supply in the Member States afflicts the European Union as a whole .
This is the basis of European solidarity <unk w="on"/> a basis <unk w="for"/> developing emergency response measures .
My second <unk w="point"/> is that the report mentions CCS <unk w="to"/> <unk w="without"/> having the potential to meet our environmental targets while exploiting a source of <unk w="income"/> - coal - that is <unk w="not"/> <unk w="important"/> in Europe .
By developing CCS , Europe can become a world <unk w="frassoni"/> in advanced technologies , which will contribute to our global competitiveness and strengthen our economies .
<unk w="the"/> same <unk w="is"/> true for <unk w="the"/> gasification <unk w="and"/> , <unk w="which"/> <unk w="is"/> very important as an additional source of gas <unk w="costs"/> - <unk w="which"/> means diversification of <unk w="energy"/> supply .
My third point <unk w="is"/> <unk w="to"/> this strategic document <unk w="and"/> <unk w="on"/> the need for investment <unk w="in"/> the energy supply <unk w="programme"/> .
Infrastructure projects <unk w="and"/> <unk w="we"/> support at EU level should first and foremost contribute <unk w="to"/> <unk w="the"/> real diversification <unk w="of"/> sources and routes of <unk w="each"/> to the Member States and to <unk w="the"/> <unk w="it"/> as a whole .
Investment in Ukraine seems to be of special <unk w="importance"/> for us .
Together with our <unk w="social"/> partners , we could , in the <unk w="end"/> , <unk w="support"/> the joint <unk w="motion"/> for <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> on the Russian-Ukrainian border .
The reason for such a step on our <unk w="matter"/> is very simple .
<unk w="in"/> terms of <unk w="labour"/> relations , Ukraine <unk w=","/> with international <unk w="organisations"/> .
It <unk w="has"/> ratified the Energy Charter Treaty and , therefore , plays <unk w="a"/> transparent rules .
My <unk w="second"/> point <unk w="is"/> that our strategic document greatly <unk w="to"/> <unk w="the"/> efforts towards implementing the Third Energy Package .
It means a working internal <unk w="market"/> in energy for the European Union ; <unk w="we"/> <unk w=","/> solidarity and support on <unk w="both"/> sides .
Let us finish the legislative procedure <unk w="over"/> <unk w="the"/> next three months .
( FI ) Mr <unk w="president"/> , <unk w="commissioner"/> , ladies and gentlemen , we have history behind <unk w="it"/> .
<unk w="in"/> <unk w="however"/> , our <unk w="criminal"/> networks <unk w="are"/> <unk w="able"/> to meet the needs of the Cold War and for <unk w="the"/> political circumstances . Now <unk w="we"/> have improved <unk w="and"/> have been patched up here and there , but this has caused us a problem that we <unk w="will"/> have to return to again later on .
<unk w="given"/> the need <unk w="for"/> energy has grown dramatically <unk w="and"/> the economy has developed at a <unk w="faster"/> rate , so the <unk w="growth"/> , supply and environmental problems have also changed .
As the problems are <unk w="concerned"/> , obviously <unk w=","/> solutions <unk w="to"/> what <unk w="is"/> needed .
It is therefore important that we involve the <unk w="member"/> States and the developing <unk w="countries"/> in a common energy process .
We will show the way , <unk w="as"/> the United States has to follow Europe 's example and must <unk w="be"/> alongside us .
As energy solutions <unk w="is"/> <unk w="concerned"/> , we <unk w="need"/> European energy <unk w="policy"/> , and I understand that the <unk w="need"/> for Energy has done quite a <unk w="lot"/> of <unk w="interest"/> in that regard and in connection with this latest energy <unk w="sector"/> .
We <unk w="know"/> <unk w="that"/> diplomacy <unk w="for"/> the <unk w="main"/> reason that these are such <unk w="a"/> <unk w="fact"/> that there have been wars over them before and there will be again in <unk w="the"/> future .
It is <unk w="therefore"/> quite obvious that we need an energy mix comprising various <unk w="energy"/> sources that is <unk w="very"/> broadly based <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> possible , because that will stabilise <unk w="the"/> energy situation and as a result <unk w="of"/> nation 's diversity , and Europe 's too , will come into its own .
Of course , saving <unk w="energy"/> is <unk w="an"/> important solution to the problem : it is the <unk w="case"/> and the <unk w="most"/> effective method .
For this we need something that I regard today as <unk w="the"/> most <unk w="the"/> single thing that <unk w="can"/> <unk w="been"/> done : making energy intelligent .
If we <unk w="do"/> not greatly increase the use of intelligent technology <unk w=","/> will not <unk w="set"/> our targets .
Luckily , smart <unk w="fees"/> has developed at just the same time .
People <unk w="of"/> <unk w="to"/> do not <unk w="have"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="that"/> they are consuming without <unk w="new"/> technology .
<unk w="however"/> , information <unk w="and"/> <unk w="communications"/> technologies ( ITC ) are <unk w="a"/> solution that will help us reach <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and <unk w="remind"/> us <unk w="in"/> order .
They are therefore like a good <unk w="example"/> , but also a good hired hand because <unk w="it"/> is not just needed <unk w="in"/> <unk w="this"/> network , <unk w="but"/> also <unk w=","/> equipment , <unk w="recycling"/> and cars .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w="it"/> is human activity , intelligence is needed to control <unk w="tobacco"/> consumption .
In this connection , I would stress in particular <unk w="to"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="to"/> the small and medium-sized enterprise <unk w=","/> and the innovations that come from this , <unk w="but"/> it can be truly inventive .
Then there <unk w="is"/> the social dimension : energy poverty <unk w="and"/> , <unk w="which"/> , <unk w="and"/> <unk w="is"/> linked to <unk w="what"/> has just <unk w="been"/> said .
We find <unk w="it"/> odd that Ukraine is a transit country .
<unk w="however"/> , as Mr Swoboda said , the <unk w="eu"/> should be under alternative management , for <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> tripartite management <unk w="which"/> would include <unk w="the"/> EU , and that way the problem would go away .
Madam <unk w="president"/> , in <unk w="all"/> the discussions on the energy crisis , there is one aspect <unk w="of"/> <unk w="my"/> colleague , Anne Laperrouze , does mention , but which generally receives insufficient attention .
We <unk w="talked"/> about energy efficiency in the context of climate <unk w="change"/> and <unk w="the"/> fuel poverty , but <unk w="increasing"/> efficiency is also of huge strategic importance .
Controlling demand takes <unk w="them"/> off the <unk w="right"/> <unk w=","/> and is crucial <unk w="to"/> <unk w="the"/> energy independence in <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> .
I want to <unk w="highlight"/> <unk w="a"/> specific <unk w="points"/> in the context of the oral question on the <unk w="issue"/> of information <unk w="and"/> communication technologies .
<unk w="however"/> , I am <unk w="sure"/> that <unk w="the"/> roll-out of smart meters is <unk w="simply"/> going ahead with the <unk w="degree"/> of commitment required <unk w="by"/> the Energy End-Use Efficiency and Energy Services Directive <unk w="are"/> called for in <unk w="the"/> Morgan report .
In some countries , digital displays are available to <unk w="help"/> consumers <unk w="how"/> much energy <unk w="they"/> are using - <unk w="it"/> is helpful - but a <unk w="few"/> smart <unk w="is"/> <unk w="is"/> much more than that .
<unk w="it"/> allows two-way communication , detailed analysis <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> demand and proper measurement and payment <unk w="of"/> electricity supplied by micro-renewables .
They <unk w="are"/> crucial to the task of transforming buildings from being energy consumers into <unk w="a"/> net energy <unk w="market"/> .
Secondly , with regard to lighting , I <unk w="think"/> we <unk w="are"/> about to <unk w="go"/> ahead with taking the most inefficient domestic lighting <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="balkans"/> , and <unk w="the"/> same needs <unk w="to"/> happen <unk w="in"/> office and street lighting .
<unk w="we"/> should , however , <unk w="also"/> be looking forward <unk w="to"/> the next <unk w="few"/> steps , such as wider use of smart lighting systems using <unk w="it"/> , which measure movement and the degree of natural light so that <unk w="they"/> can be reduced - or indeed switched off when <unk w="it"/> .
<unk w="there"/> is a lot more to energy-efficient lighting than compact fluorescents , and it is <unk w="important"/> for the <unk w="public"/> sector - and that <unk w="of"/> the European institutions - to <unk w="take"/> the lead on using ICT for energy efficiency .
( LV ) <unk w="mr"/> President , Commissioners , I <unk w="would"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="like"/> to thank <unk w="mrs"/> Laperrouze for her extremely <unk w="serious"/> <unk w="report"/> .
<unk w="we"/> always <unk w=","/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="the"/> decisions <unk w="and"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="of"/> our values and policies .
I have reason to <unk w="say"/> that the recent gas crisis has <unk w="caused"/> <unk w="the"/> eyes of <unk w="parliament"/> <unk w="in"/> relation to the vulnerability of many <unk w="of"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w=","/> with <unk w="regard"/> to energy supply .
Not <unk w="only"/> the recovery plan and the Second <unk w="renewable"/> Energy <unk w="policy"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="commission"/> but also this report <unk w=","/> <unk w="let"/> us hope that <unk w="the"/> <unk w="is"/> <unk w="be"/> a unified <unk w="european"/> energy policy , and that includes the <unk w="fact"/> that the isolated energy islands of Europe will <unk w="at"/> last be eliminated , including that of the Baltic States .
Another aspect relates <unk w="to"/> <unk w="sustainable"/> development <unk w="of"/> liquefied natural gas terminals .
These could <unk w="have"/> become an alternative to supplies of Russian gas in many locations , but only on condition that national governments are able to withstand <unk w="the"/> pressure , and not create them as extra capacity <unk w="for"/> the <unk w="part"/> of Russian gas , but solely <unk w="to"/> import terminals .
( DE ) Madam President , <unk w="i"/> Piebalgs , Mrs Reding , ladies and gentlemen , we need <unk w="to"/> <unk w="debate"/> .
We <unk w="must"/> <unk w="on"/> the verge of an energy crisis and a financial crisis .
<unk w="we"/> need to make an <unk w="effort"/> to invest as quickly and as <unk w="it"/> <unk w="as"/> possible , and therefore we <unk w="cannot"/> but say ' yes ' to <unk w="european"/> construction not <unk w="only"/> <unk w="oil"/> pipelines but also <unk w="for"/> LNG <unk w="it"/> .
We should build them as quickly <unk w="as"/> <unk w="possible"/> , as this <unk w="would"/> create <unk w=","/> and thus <unk w="lead"/> to full employment in Europe .
The pipelines should not compete with each other ; <unk w="secondly"/> , the construction of each new pipeline <unk w="is"/> a <unk w="difficult"/> situation , <unk w="which"/> is the construction of LNG <unk w="europe"/> .
Above <unk w="all"/> , we <unk w="have"/> to <unk w="improve"/> <unk w="greater"/> energy efficiency , not via <unk w="community"/> funding , but rather by means of tax breaks .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w="we"/> could give every citizen <unk w="a"/> <unk w="total"/> of EUR 10 000 a year <unk w="after"/> they could offset against tax , we could make an immediate start on investing in energy efficiency and renewable energy ; <unk w="with"/> regard to the latter , progressive <unk w="terrorism"/> , in other <unk w="words"/> <unk w=","/> immediate inclusion of costs on <unk w="a"/> balance sheet , would <unk w="be"/> a <unk w="very"/> valuable tool .
If we could set a three-year limit for this , it would be a great success for all of <unk w="us"/> .
We could <unk w="have"/> a better handle on employment and energy .
<unk w="in"/> this <unk w="respect"/> , it is up to Commissioner Kovács to launch an initiative .
One point which <unk w="will"/> exercises us in this programme is , quite naturally , the nuclear industry : it is vital to ensure the safety <unk w="and"/> security <unk w="and"/> <unk w="nuclear"/> power stations , and to do so to the very best <unk w="of"/> <unk w="our"/> ability .
<unk w="it"/> is not <unk w="the"/> <unk w="to"/> set <unk w="of"/> bar too high here : quite simply , <unk w="we"/> need <unk w="more"/> to trust in the European Union that the appropriate steps will be taken , that further security research will be conducted and that <unk w="it"/> will be legally binding requirements allowing dangerous nuclear power stations to be removed from the grid <unk w=","/> following a ruling by a court or regulator .
The <unk w="citizens"/> of Europe have a right to safety in this field , so that we can go <unk w="well"/> into a future in which energy generation <unk w="has"/> not put us in <unk w="time"/> and <unk w="it"/> can sleep <unk w="'"/> .
Ultimately , however , it will also be up to <unk w="the"/> Council , in the group <unk w="responsible"/> for nuclear safety , to live <unk w="up"/> to their responsibilities <unk w="and"/> not <unk w="to"/> go <unk w="along"/> a path that the <unk w="commission"/> will not appreciate , by blocking proposals from <unk w="the"/> European Parliament and the Commission .
( ES ) Madam <unk w="president"/> , Commissioners , the <unk w="economic"/> situation <unk w="is"/> Russia and <unk w="russia"/> and the gas supply has <unk w="clearly"/> shown that <unk w="more"/> than ever before we need <unk w="to"/> diversify our supply and <unk w="make"/> connections between Member States and with producer countries .
The Commission <unk w="'s"/> proposals <unk w="are"/> heading in <unk w="this"/> direction , but in the interests <unk w="of"/> greater efficacy these proposals should also include , and I <unk w="am"/> glad to hear the Commissioner mention it <unk w="is"/> , the potential in the south of <unk w="the"/> continent and <unk w="in"/> particular in <unk w="my"/> country , Spain .
Spain is <unk w="a"/> Member State <unk w=","/> the <unk w="highest"/> diversification <unk w="of"/> supply , <unk w="especially"/> in terms of the number <unk w="of"/> countries - our gas is imported from 10 different <unk w="countries"/> - as <unk w="is"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> in the range of formats .
For <unk w="this"/> reason , my country is an excellent supply platform for the European Union .
The supply is achieved both through the gas <unk w="package"/> from <unk w="europe"/> as well as <unk w="the"/> liquefied natural gas <unk w="or"/> similar volumes <unk w="from"/> that of Nabucco , but at a lower cost and with better delivery times .
However this platform cannot currently be used by the European Union due to the lack <unk w="of"/> a connection <unk w="with"/> France .
<unk w="thirdly"/> , <unk w="and"/> Piebalgs , must be a priority for the European Union , as must <unk w="be"/> specific problems <unk w="for"/> our island territories .
If <unk w="the"/> Iberian peninsular clearly <unk w="differs"/> from isolation in energy <unk w="sources"/> , <unk w="issues"/> such as the Balearic Islands , <unk w="which"/> I am from , suffer a double isolation .
This is very <unk w="important"/> for the inhabitants of these islands because <unk w="we"/> , as Europeans , have <unk w="fundamental"/> rights .
I sincerely request , Mr Piebalgs , that you consider <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> situation of island territories when <unk w="making"/> decisions and establishing priorities .
Finally , I would like to thank <unk w="mrs"/> <unk w="rapporteur"/> for her work .
( SV ) Madam <unk w="president"/> , Commissioner , the <unk w="council"/> has had to learn the hard way <unk w="and"/> it means to be far too dependent on a single energy supplier .
The citizens of several Member States have been affected by <unk w="parliament"/> 's capriciousness <unk w="in"/> a totally <unk w="different"/> way .
We know that Russia <unk w="is"/> ruthless when dealing <unk w="with"/> its neighbours , but when freezing Slovakians and Bulgarians were taken hostage <unk w="by"/> the quarrel between Russia and <unk w="how"/> it was , hopefully , a wake-up call for all of us , including us here in this Parliament .
Ukraine needs the support of the EU , <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of <unk w="electricity"/> with gas <unk w="and"/> Azerbaijan , among others , must <unk w="also"/> get underway .
The <unk w="eu"/> must now demonstrate an ability to take action , precisely <unk w="those"/> called for by <unk w="mr"/> Swoboda .
We know that Russia is pressing for Nord Stream , <unk w="in"/> gas pipeline in the <unk w="irish"/> Sea .
The Baltic Sea is one of our <unk w="most"/> sensitive inland seas .
Out of consideration for the environment and the economy , this pipeline should not <unk w="be"/> laid <unk w="down"/> the Baltic Sea , added to which are <unk w="social"/> security policy aspects .
The European Parliament has also <unk w="expressed"/> its doubts <unk w="about"/> this on a previous occasion .
I am pleased to <unk w="hear"/> that the report maintains <unk w="that"/> nuclear energy needs to <unk w="be"/> an important part <unk w="of"/> Europe 's future energy mix .
If <unk w="the"/> <unk w="were"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="on"/> the emissions reduction requirements of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="railway"/> package <unk w="we"/> need modern European <unk w="renewable"/> energy .
It is good that we are able <unk w="to"/> <unk w="do"/> this in <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> over the next few days .
( PL ) Madam President , Commissioners , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> time to speak <unk w="again"/> .
Firstly , the European Union <unk w="does"/> not have an energy strategy .
This fact encourages Russia , for example , which treats energy resources as a political weapon , to make attempts <unk w="under"/> pressure and blackmail , which <unk w="is"/> the EU 's situation worse .
Secondly , the EU has <unk w="led"/> to <unk w="genetic"/> manipulation <unk w="of"/> the form <unk w="of"/> intimidation with global <unk w="global"/> warming due to <unk w="co2"/> emissions .
Increasing numbers of experts <unk w="and"/> facts confirm that this is <unk w="particularly"/> true .
With <unk w="regard"/> to those who <unk w="are"/> spreading this <unk w="report"/> and intimidating us with global warming , it would be worth <unk w="mentioning"/> in whose interests they <unk w="are"/> acting .
<unk w="however"/> , the EU requires <unk w="a"/> energy strategy based on <unk w="the"/> principle of the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="union"/> , in other words help <unk w="in"/> the form of financial aid and investment in those countries which are most <unk w="dependent"/> on one supplier , like <unk w="the"/> Baltic States and <unk w="denmark"/> .
Fourthly , the EU needs <unk w="a"/> <unk w="prevent"/> and restore hard <unk w="potential"/> and <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> coal to favour , because it has <unk w="caused"/> supplies of <unk w="them"/> and they are <unk w="not"/> .
<unk w="however"/> , the EU <unk w="is"/> a tax <unk w="on"/> <unk w="foreign"/> policy to <unk w="the"/> new technologies <unk w=","/> savings in energy emissions , and this it does <unk w="not"/> have .
( DE ) Madam President , <unk w="ladies"/> and gentlemen , <unk w="first"/> <unk w=","/> all I <unk w="would"/> very much like <unk w="to"/> thank Mrs <unk w="karamanou"/> and <unk w="his"/> Piebalgs for all the documents they have <unk w="made"/> .
I do not agree with all of the details , <unk w="but"/> the proposals go in the right strategic direction : it is right <unk w="and"/> necessary <unk w="to"/> focus once <unk w="again"/> on the <unk w="fact"/> that security of supply <unk w="is"/> one <unk w="of"/> the central issues .
We have perhaps devoted too much of our attention to other energy policy issues over the last year , and I am grateful that security of supply has now returned <unk w="on"/> to <unk w="this"/> stage .
Secondly , I <unk w="am"/> also <unk w="say"/> that <unk w="the"/> proposed position <unk w="is"/> so nuanced .
<unk w="as"/> has been said , one might not agree with <unk w="a"/> single point , but the report is generally correct , contrary to what Mr Turmes just suggested .
Mr Turmes , it is wrong to believe that <unk w="it"/> is a simple <unk w="exercise"/> , a <unk w="few"/> <unk w="solution"/> to this enormous , complicated problem .
Politicians <unk w="must"/> try <unk w="to"/> give a quick , simple <unk w="reason"/> that <unk w="is"/> <unk w="it"/> , but that is just <unk w="as"/> <unk w="case"/> .
It is , <unk w="however"/> , damned <unk w="it"/> , which is <unk w="an"/> <unk w="an"/> answer <unk w="to"/> <unk w="extremely"/> varied .
We cannot make people promises and act as if we have a solution and everything is magically going <unk w="to"/> be <unk w="demanded"/> ; quite apart from anything <unk w="else"/> , the <unk w="president"/> would one day be bitterly disappointed when they realised that <unk w="it"/> does <unk w="not"/> work that way .
This <unk w="also"/> means that there is not just a <unk w="renewable"/> energy source , but rather that <unk w="we"/> will continue <unk w="for"/> a long time to work with several sources .
It is immoral to just discard a source of energy : in <unk w="my"/> view , it is <unk w="up"/> to simply <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> nuclear energy .
It is <unk w="one"/> of the solution : not the whole solution , of course , but it should be realised that it has a <unk w="duty"/> <unk w="to"/> make .
I would also caution <unk w="to"/> staking too much on gas : we have <unk w="just"/> heard a great deal about the dependency that entails .
I <unk w="therefore"/> <unk w="say"/> that we need to realise <unk w="that"/> we cannot just carelessly give up on coal - an energy source that we have <unk w="in"/> our country and in many other places in <unk w="europe"/> - and <unk w="the"/> ' coal <unk w="and"/> CO2 , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="is"/> <unk w="is"/> not an option ' .
We also need a nuanced response to <unk w="the"/> issue of the various routes <unk w="of"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
As Mr Rübig just said , <unk w="it"/> is not one <unk w="'s"/> answer for a pipeline : <unk w="it"/> would be a mistake <unk w="to"/> just opt for one ; instead , we need <unk w="to"/> open up a variety of routes and options .
Nobody today can predict <unk w="legal"/> certainty what will happen in 10 , 20 or 30 <unk w="years"/> ' time .
In <unk w="this"/> <unk w="opinion"/> , the <unk w="measures"/> we need to take is <unk w="to"/> say ' yes ' to intelligent solutions .
By intelligent , I mean varied , <unk w="from"/> being open to new things and <unk w="are"/> standing still .
<unk w="the"/> answer <unk w="is"/> investing in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="are"/> being open to solutions that we currently cannot see at all , and not casually ruling out one option or another .
It would be a fatal mistake - and it is one made in some energy policy decisions - to give those <unk w="who"/> actually have to invest the money , namely companies , too <unk w="little"/> room <unk w="for"/> manoeuvre <unk w="and"/> too little support .
Does anybody really believe that <unk w="however"/> , the <unk w="member"/> States , the State <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> Community will be able <unk w="to"/> <unk w="solve"/> the problem <unk w="of"/> investment ?
( BG ) Madam President , Commissioners , first of all I would like to highlight the constructive debate <unk w="by"/> the Committee <unk w="on"/> Industry , Research and Energy on the report <unk w="by"/> Mrs Laperrouze , and especially point out her role in preparing an objective <unk w="of"/> all-encompassing report .
I want to especially concentrate on the proposals <unk w="contained"/> in the report which have <unk w="been"/> <unk w=","/> with <unk w="the"/> aim of reflecting the problems faced by those countries <unk w="which"/> <unk w="have"/> <unk w="are"/> deeply affected by external energy <unk w="and"/> suppliers , in particular <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
First of all , <unk w="the"/> importance of the European <unk w="union"/> <unk w="of"/> participating in <unk w="pilot"/> projects for <unk w="renewable"/> energy links , <unk w="in"/> particular <unk w="the"/> Member States ' gas and energy supply networks , has <unk w="been"/> noted .
However , it is with regret that I point out that only <unk w="eur"/> 20 million has been set aside for the Commission 's project <unk w="and"/> <unk w="the"/> Republic of Bulgaria and <unk w="its"/> links with Greece , <unk w="and"/> Bulgaria being <unk w="out"/> of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> seriously affected countries .
The <unk w="social"/> field in <unk w="general"/> , for <unk w="example"/> , which <unk w="will"/> solve the problems of the crisis with minimum supplies , has not been mentioned at all .
<unk w="however"/> , all possibilities for <unk w="which"/> the southern <unk w="mediterranean"/> corridor have been included , in other <unk w="words"/> , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="regard"/> to the Nabucco project , the South <unk w=","/> and TGI <unk w=","/> <unk w="has"/> also noted .
Also <unk w="it"/> is the long-term <unk w="strategy"/> for the possibility of gas being <unk w="generated"/> by <unk w="third"/> countries in the <unk w="countries"/> such as <unk w="syria"/> and Iran .
Thirdly , the importance <unk w="of"/> liquefied gas <unk w="is"/> being constructed in the European <unk w="union"/> is <unk w="concerned"/> , and also that <unk w="it"/> <unk w="should"/> be <unk w="a"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="the"/> Member <unk w="states"/> on the basis of the principle of solidarity .
<unk w="it"/> is once again <unk w="very"/> important for <unk w="the"/> joint use of such terminals by Bulgaria and Greece .
Fourthly , I call upon <unk w="the"/> Commission to <unk w="take"/> into expanding the energy community in South East Europe and other neighbouring countries with <unk w="the"/> aim of forming a <unk w="single"/> market for the whole region .
As rapporteur <unk w=","/> the <unk w="need"/> and conditions for access to gas supply networks , I want <unk w=","/> once <unk w="again"/> underline the significance of <unk w="the"/> Third Energy Package for the formation of a <unk w="single"/> European <unk w="union"/> market and to urge its quickest possible implementation .
Finally , I want to point out that the report objectively expresses <unk w="the"/> role of <unk w="renewable"/> energy too .
I consider that the current framework directive for nuclear safety will become a good basis for analysing the state of all reactors in the European Union , <unk w="and"/> not just of newly-constructed ones , and will <unk w="be"/> an objective base for the evaluation of <unk w="food"/> safety .
It is clear that politically based decisions like those taken in relation <unk w="to"/> Kozloduy <unk w="will"/> be long-term ones in the current development of energy <unk w="production"/> in <unk w="the"/> European Union .
I hope <unk w="that"/> Member States will be in <unk w="a"/> position , based on <unk w="concrete"/> criteria , to reconsider the issue about the <unk w="nuclear"/> reactors .
- ( FR ) Madam President , Mrs Laperrouze 's report on <unk w="social"/> policy concerns a subject of huge <unk w="responsibility"/> for all <unk w="the"/> countries of the Union .
I greatly respect her <unk w="for"/> the <unk w="way"/> she <unk w="has"/> <unk w="out"/> , but <unk w="the"/> situation remains very serious .
The excruciating and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="viability"/> of our <unk w="lives"/> in the <unk w="balkans"/> in <unk w="colombia"/> , like the forecasts that <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> us <unk w="on"/> a significant energy shortage over <unk w="the"/> <unk w="for"/> two decades , all point towards the need for energy policy to be a key <unk w="component"/> of our <unk w="foreign"/> policy .
However , <unk w="in"/> future <unk w=","/> <unk w="president"/> , Commissioner , because <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and resources .
<unk w="in"/> terms <unk w="of"/> solidarity , <unk w="it"/> does not perhaps apply to the Commission , <unk w="but"/> rather to certain large European <unk w="companies"/> .
I <unk w="fully"/> agree <unk w="with"/> Mr Swoboda that <unk w="it"/> is a big embarrassment for the European Union .
For example , the Russian South Stream pipeline supported by the State and by certain <unk w="member"/> <unk w=","/> is in danger of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="death"/> , which is twice as <unk w="important"/> and which , <unk w="in"/> its <unk w="opinion"/> , acts in <unk w="accordance"/> with the rules of the <unk w="treaty"/> .
Its sources <unk w="of"/> supply in Azerbaijan <unk w="are"/> being seized <unk w="in"/> its <unk w="way"/> , which makes it a precarious and dubious investment .
In this way the Union is probably going to <unk w="have"/> the <unk w="historic"/> opportunity of diversity and greater security ...
( HU ) Madam President , the <unk w="new"/> Strategic Energy Review could not <unk w="be"/> more timely .
The security of supply <unk w="in"/> <unk w="the"/> eastern half of the European Union has certainly been challenged by the events of the beginning of the year .
After a three-week crisis , <unk w="on"/> 20 January natural <unk w="disaster"/> has <unk w="once"/> again <unk w="been"/> flowing to <unk w="them"/> , but <unk w="the"/> <unk w="it"/> is , for how long ?
In order to <unk w="be"/> able truly <unk w="to"/> guarantee security of <unk w="protection"/> , we <unk w="need"/> to learn the lessons of the gas dispute .
By this I mean first <unk w="of"/> all <unk w="the"/> diversification of <unk w="renewable"/> energy types <unk w="industry"/> , the sources of supply <unk w="and"/> delivery routes .
According to calculations , Europe uses <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> billion m ³ of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="last"/> year , and <unk w="the"/> demand may grow , <unk w="according"/> to certain analyses , by as much as <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> % in the next 20 years .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> Stream pipeline transporting <unk w="from"/> gas to Europe is already under construction , and the Blue <unk w="movement"/> in Turkey is ready ; agreement has been reached by the interested <unk w="parties"/> on <unk w="the"/> <unk w="north"/> <unk w="of"/> South Stream , Ukraine has undertaken the creation <unk w="of"/> White Stream , and then there <unk w="is"/> the much talked-about Nabucco , albeit with uncertain sources <unk w="of"/> financial backing .
In <unk w="this"/> case , <unk w="we"/> on Russia will for the most part remain .
Although Nabucco would <unk w="include"/> Asian gas , so far - unlike Gazprom - Europe has not even made <unk w="an"/> offer to Baku .
Many may say that , for the moment , we can trust that <unk w="the"/> negotiations <unk w="between"/> the European Commissioners and <unk w="the"/> Russian delegation <unk w="at"/> the Moscow summit will bring substantive <unk w="uncertainty"/> and lead <unk w="to"/> significant progress as regards the gas pipelines , and that <unk w="in"/> future <unk w="we"/> will <unk w="be"/> <unk w="with"/> the <unk w="public"/> <unk w="state"/> monopoly alone that dictates <unk w="it"/> .
This is possible , but for my part , <unk w="in"/> addition <unk w="to"/> all <unk w="this"/> - <unk w="and"/> <unk w="-"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="everything"/> else - I believe that the <unk w="way"/> forward is to use less and cleaner energy .
<unk w="that"/> is <unk w="precisely"/> why I maintain that there is a need for a European <unk w="union"/> ' New Deal ' , in other words , <unk w="is"/> that <unk w="is"/> at <unk w="the"/> growth <unk w="is"/> stimulating and utilising innovation <unk w="and"/> environmental <unk w="protection"/> .
As a result <unk w="of"/> the current global financial crisis , more and more people are <unk w="now"/> up to the fact that a new logic of economic organisation is <unk w="concerned"/> .
Increasing numbers of <unk w="workers"/> <unk w=","/> recognising that , in order to <unk w="move"/> from <unk w="a"/> global crisis , a fresh <unk w="police"/> force is necessary , with <unk w="the"/> engine running <unk w="for"/> new organisational principles .
More and more people are recognising the need <unk w="for"/> a paradigm <unk w="solution"/> .
The green ' New Deal ' , <unk w="in"/> other words a new logic for <unk w="an"/> organisation based on innovations <unk w=","/> environmental technology and supported by international capital markets , <unk w="has"/> become the cornerstone of <unk w="the"/> numbers of <unk w="the"/> rescue and <unk w="educational"/> programmes , including among the European Union Member <unk w="states"/> .
<unk w="i"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> this stimulus because last year <unk w="the"/> number <unk w="of"/> <unk w="people"/> <unk w="involved"/> in Europe <unk w=","/> by 1.7 million .
The <unk w="'"/> green ' New <unk w="approach"/> ' , should it receive the green light , will <unk w="have"/> a fundamental effect on Europe 's <unk w="future"/> energy policy .
( CS ) Ladies and gentlemen , the European Union at present imports 50 % of <unk w="renewable"/> energy it consumes and this <unk w="sector"/> is constantly growing .
The Union <unk w="'s"/> dependence on imports of conventional <unk w="sources"/> of energy and on a limited number of <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> represents a serious threat to <unk w="social"/> security , <unk w="stability"/> and prosperity .
This strategic review of <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> 's energy policy <unk w=","/> therefore , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="fact"/> , <unk w="and"/> at the <unk w="same"/> time .
I am of the view <unk w="that"/> <unk w="women"/> ' three times 20 ' objective for 2020 is correct from the <unk w="social"/> , economic and ecological standpoints .
However , attainment of this objective requires a common <unk w="policy"/> throughout <unk w="the"/> entire <unk w="european"/> Union , <unk w="and"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="european"/> Union and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="from"/> outside .
The creation <unk w="of"/> a common <unk w="audiovisual"/> policy requires the completion of ratification <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="convention"/> and the submission of a <unk w="proposal"/> for such a common energy <unk w="policy"/> .
In the internal market there is a need for a clear and stable legal framework and , above all , a need to complete the integration <unk w="of"/> <unk w="renewable"/> energy systems throughout the territory of the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="union"/> .
<unk w="the"/> clause on mutual solidarity will remain just an empty phrase <unk w="unless"/> we do not connect these energy systems .
There is also a <unk w="need"/> to strengthen the use of all <unk w="the"/> energy <unk w="sources"/> , from conservation <unk w="and"/> increasing the proportion <unk w="of"/> renewable sources to greater use of safe nuclear <unk w="energy"/> .
<unk w="there"/> <unk w="is"/> no need to <unk w="ensure"/> that financial investment <unk w="in"/> our domestic energy industry will <unk w="also"/> provide a <unk w="solution"/> in the form of a resumption of economic growth .
As far as external relations in the field of <unk w="cooperation"/> are concerned , this aspect too requires far greater diversification than before .
There is a need for a more <unk w="constructive"/> dialogue with producer countries , transit countries and other consumer countries .
<unk w="this"/> should be increased with <unk w="the"/> countries of the Middle East , the <unk w="mediterranean"/> region and <unk w="in"/> Africa .
This should <unk w="be"/> done within the <unk w="framework"/> of the Barcelona Process : Union for the Mediterranean .
<unk w="the"/> dialogue <unk w="must"/> also include the candidate country Turkey and , in my <unk w="opinion"/> , it <unk w="is"/> <unk w="be"/> essential to look <unk w="for"/> a far more <unk w="balanced"/> approach to <unk w="areas"/> like Iran .
In conclusion I should like <unk w="to"/> <unk w="thank"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="congratulate"/> Mrs <unk w="lucas"/> on , I <unk w="hope"/> , a first-rate <unk w="and"/> balanced <unk w="report"/> .
( <unk w="applause"/> ) <unk w="are"/> we <unk w="are"/> talking about <unk w="the"/> need for a common energy policy as far <unk w="back"/> as 2006 , each individual EU State is responsible for <unk w="providing"/> a <unk w="renewable"/> energy supply .
However , solidarity among the Member States is essential for the survival of the <unk w="union"/> itself .
The <unk w="eu"/> must immediately <unk w="have"/> effective legislation to help <unk w="the"/> energy supply <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> avoid them altogether .
The Commission proposes <unk w="an"/> EU Energy <unk w="policy"/> and <unk w="the"/> Action Plan , <unk w="which"/> <unk w="the"/> important aspects of which are the creation of infrastructure and the diversification of energy sources .
I am delighted that among <unk w="the"/> <unk w="member"/> <unk w="are"/> set to <unk w="the"/> EU energy <unk w="policy"/> priorities is <unk w="the"/> interconnection plan for the <unk w="future"/> <unk w="of"/> the Baltic Sea , which would <unk w="be"/> <unk w="the"/> insecure <unk w="small"/> islands still existing in <unk w="the"/> EU .
I would like to ask the Commission for all kinds <unk w="of"/> support in the construction of <unk w="the"/> energy link between Lithuania and Sweden <unk w=","/> <unk w="the"/> Lithuanian-Polish energy <unk w="policy"/> .
<unk w="however"/> , returning to the <unk w="european"/> Union <unk w="'s"/> fundamental principle - solidarity - and <unk w="the"/> application in the field of energy , many doubts <unk w="exist"/> as to the future of this <unk w="directive"/> .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="this"/> Package , <unk w="and"/> the creation of an <unk w="independent"/> internal electricity and gas market with <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> for the Cooperation of Energy <unk w="policy"/> .
At the same <unk w="time"/> , <unk w="we"/> and <unk w="we"/> are establishing a Russian-German <unk w="european"/> agency .
How is <unk w="it"/> <unk w="cooperation"/> with EU <unk w="member"/> State <unk w="aid"/> , the common energy policy and energy security ?
( PL ) <unk w=","/> <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> , Commissioners , in this debate I <unk w="would"/> like to draw attention to three <unk w="points"/> .
Firstly , Russia is increasingly clearly using supplies <unk w="and"/> <unk w="own"/> resources , and mainly gas , to exert a <unk w="large"/> political <unk w="solution"/> .
Not only <unk w="did"/> the last gas conflict between <unk w="colombia"/> and <unk w="which"/> cause huge economic losses in many EU countries , but with a <unk w="lack"/> of permission from the <unk w="commission"/> it <unk w="once"/> again <unk w="to"/> Ukraine into a clear economic dependence <unk w="on"/> Russia .
For it is difficult to imagine <unk w="that"/> the Ukrainian <unk w="we"/> will be able to function if the <unk w="liberalisation"/> of gas <unk w="from"/> <unk w="of"/> USD 400 per 1 000 cubic metres .
Secondly , a new partnership agreement between the EU and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="countries"/> to be negotiated , which will contain details <unk w="on"/> the energy question but will <unk w="also"/> contain a clear stipulation that Russia will not use the supply of energy resources to exert political influence , and that <unk w="new"/> suppliers will be liable for damages arising from a break in supply .
Thirdly and <unk w="finally"/> , the European Union , by using its own financial means <unk w="and"/> also the European Investment Bank , should support first <unk w="and"/> foremost gas <unk w=","/> which really diversify the supply of gas to the EU , and so <unk w="to"/> create a real capability to import gas from countries other <unk w="than"/> Russia , such as the Nabucco gas pipeline .
Madam President , we will never <unk w="have"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="to"/> security or the 80 % reduction in our carbon dioxide <unk w="emissions"/> by <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> if <unk w="we"/> continue to effectively ignore both the <unk w="future"/> of energy security and the critical importance of pan-European high-voltage direct <unk w="education"/> ( HVDC ) <unk w="]"/> .
That includes an HVDC line to North Africa : smart electrical <unk w="refunds"/> over Europe and North Africa .
Having had the <unk w="opportunity"/> last week to <unk w="the"/> first <unk w="of"/> the exciting <unk w="and"/> thermal operations in Grenada and <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , and having read over the weekend Harvard professor Michael McElroy 's views on freeing the United States from its <unk w="eur"/> 750 <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> annual bill for importing oil , winning the energy security battle in <unk w="the"/> US <unk w=","/> <unk w="at"/> the <unk w="first"/> time saving the <unk w="butter"/> , I ask <unk w="them"/> : what <unk w="are"/> we <unk w="are"/> debating ?
The smart grid <unk w="will"/> allow solar , wind <unk w="and"/> hydro-generated <unk w=","/> to level <unk w="of"/> <unk w="and"/> graph .
If <unk w="the"/> wind is <unk w="not"/> blowing off the Irish <unk w="sea"/> <unk w="again"/> , the sun will be shining in Spain , or <unk w="the"/> wind <unk w="would"/> be blowing off the west coast of North Africa <unk w="as"/> well as the sun shining <unk w="disaster"/> .
Our national regulators will <unk w="be"/> <unk w="it"/> as their only job <unk w=","/> of now if to keep the <unk w="countryside"/> on and our homes and offices heated <unk w="by"/> peak demand .
<unk w="we"/> can no longer allow our <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> to <unk w="take"/> hostage to either energy politics <unk w="and"/> volatile oil prices .
Wind energy is competitive with coal , oil and gas , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> fuel <unk w="and"/> free .
Yes , our challenge is to build a <unk w="renewable"/> energy economy - an energy <unk w=","/> built on renewable electricity .
I conclude : the glib expression ' to cost the earth ' which we - English-language speakers anyway - <unk w="to"/> figuratively with <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> now needs to be taken literally .
If we <unk w="do"/> not rapidly change from our almost <unk w="every"/> dependence on fossil <unk w="fuels"/> , it <unk w="is"/> , as our peer review climate scientists repeatedly and with increasing urgency <unk w="and"/> out , do just that : cost <unk w="of"/> earth through <unk w="global"/> warming .
( BG ) Madam President , as <unk w="the"/> rapporteur for the Committee <unk w="on"/> Foreign Affairs , I would like to congratulate Mrs Laperrouze <unk w="on"/> this report , which gives a wide <unk w="debate"/> on the European <unk w="of"/> <unk w="of"/> problems in the field of energy , including the need for a common energy policy .
The report <unk w="which"/> very clearly indicates <unk w="that"/> actions which need to be implemented so <unk w="that"/> we can <unk w="address"/> the challenges of energy <unk w="policy"/> .
I also welcome the fact that nuclear energy has found the place it deserves in <unk w="presenting"/> a report , and is <unk w="not"/> as a necessary energy source .
<unk w="in"/> particular now , following the gas <unk w="package"/> , <unk w="it"/> is also <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and well pointed out that we have a need to diversify energy sources .
On the other hand , for <unk w="the"/> future <unk w="we"/> need to <unk w="be"/> working towards more <unk w="air"/> corridors , energy corridors , and not just <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> at the expense <unk w="of"/> another .
In October last year I noticed here , in this House , that the Nabucco <unk w="of"/> <unk w="there"/> was still ' smoke <unk w="and"/> fire ' .
I called upon <unk w="the"/> European Commission <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> to take firm action .
<unk w="i"/> can <unk w="you"/> <unk w="say"/> that noticeable action is being taken by the Commission in this direction .
An understanding <unk w="of"/> its importance is evident , particularly now following the gas <unk w="protocol"/> .
However <unk w=","/> needs to <unk w="be"/> clear that , despite the <unk w="decisions"/> and measures taken on the road to achieving ever greater <unk w="social"/> security , much <unk w="more"/> effort is needed , including serious political <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , so <unk w="that"/> we can see the light at the end of <unk w="the"/> tunnel .
I would like to tell you that Bulgaria would have been <unk w="and"/> had <unk w="and"/> not had capacity for <unk w="at"/> least 20 days ' reserve <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> at the gas storage facility in Chiren , which last year , as if the government knew what <unk w="is"/> coming , was <unk w="caused"/> by one-third of its capacity .
Therefore , for the second time today , I <unk w="shall"/> <unk w="that"/> my utter lack of understanding why the <unk w="commission"/> has completely ignored the <unk w="commission"/> proposed <unk w="in"/> <unk w="measures"/> for further expansion of this storage facility .
This was our only saviour and I think that we need to support similar <unk w="measures"/> in all other <unk w="areas"/> .
( PL ) <unk w="mr"/> President , the gas <unk w="package"/> <unk w="and"/> the financial crisis <unk w="would"/> <unk w="enable"/> us to take <unk w="action"/> and pragmatic action <unk w="that"/> is <unk w="the"/> individual interests and ideas that <unk w="are"/> economically unjustified , <unk w="such"/> as the Nord Stream pipeline .
The Second Strategic Energy Review <unk w="will"/> not give the desired added value .
A series of <unk w="proposals"/> mentioned in the <unk w="union"/> face significant difficulties in their realisation .
The citizens <unk w="of"/> the economy of the EU require rapid and specific <unk w="measures"/> and <unk w="measures"/> which will <unk w="be"/> relatively low and <unk w="renewable"/> energy costs over <unk w="the"/> <unk w="to"/> 15 years : decisions which <unk w="will"/> lead to the most significant savings possible in industry , <unk w="urban"/> and homes ; <unk w="of"/> which <unk w="are"/> <unk w="the"/> large <unk w="extent"/> <unk w="on"/> the dependence of the EU economy on the <unk w="basis"/> of <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="for"/> their correct supply ; decisions <unk w="which"/> <unk w="must"/> lead as quickly as possible to the development of a programme and <unk w="lack"/> of specific research-based measures and how <unk w="to"/> finance and implement them .
As a result of <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> will be reduced , and the bureaucratic trading of emissions - <unk w="is"/> good for the <unk w="future"/> , but not for the economy - will not <unk w="be"/> necessary .
Madam <unk w="president"/> , I am touched by the words ' smart ' and ' intelligent ' , <unk w="which"/> are very <unk w="much"/> part of this debate , <unk w="and"/> <unk w="the"/> solutions <unk w="to"/> try <unk w="to"/> use in our house to reduce energy consumption are certainly not working and they <unk w="are"/> neither <unk w="it"/> nor very intelligent .
Telling children to <unk w="put"/> things off is just not the solution .
I wish it were , as it would mean that I <unk w="was"/> in control .
<unk w="what"/> we do need all of the things that others have spoken about : sensors and other technological advancements that <unk w="will"/> make everybody 's <unk w="time"/> easier <unk w="in"/> terms of achieving our energy efficiency <unk w="""/> .
<unk w="today"/> 's debate is a massive one : <unk w="it"/> is <unk w="in"/> our climate change <unk w="and"/> , security of supply , <unk w="cooperation"/> between Member States and also economic <unk w="policies"/> - <unk w="and"/> that is an issue <unk w="for"/> us at <unk w="all"/> <unk w="level"/> - and how <unk w="do"/> <unk w="can"/> achieve a <unk w="better"/> use <unk w="of"/> our <unk w="own"/> resources .
<unk w="the"/> country I come from , Ireland , relies on oil for <unk w="only"/> 60 % of our energy needs <unk w=";"/> it is all imported .
We <unk w="must"/> <unk w="to"/> reduce that dependency , we need <unk w="to"/> develop our indigenous resources and , as I have already mentioned , improve our efficiency .
Clearly , the issue of interconnection between Member States <unk w="is"/> crucial <unk w="importance"/> for countries on the periphery .
That is quite a staggering percentage , and while we have not experienced <unk w="any"/> gas problems that other colleagues have spoken about , or the <unk w="commission"/> and <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> that <unk w="all"/> <unk w="the"/> other <unk w="member"/> States , we did <unk w="not"/> , from watching that , how critical it is <unk w="that"/> we do something about our energy mix and our energy insecurity .
So , all <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="countries"/> that are part of this report and the oral question are extremely important for us .
In particular the issue of land use needs to be <unk w="done"/> .
<unk w="the"/> Swedish experience of forestries <unk w="most"/> interesting <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="republic"/> of Ireland , where we have not developed our forestry sector .
But this is a key issue : getting the balance <unk w="right"/> between food production and fuel production .
( PT ) <unk w="mr"/> President , <unk w="commissioner"/> , ladies and gentlemen , developing a coherent <unk w="and"/> all-encompassing Community policy in the energy <unk w="sector"/> is a logical step <unk w="towards"/> a <unk w="military"/> intervention .
The <unk w="commission"/> 's proposal <unk w="is"/> Mrs Laperrouze 's <unk w="first"/> point in <unk w="this"/> direction .
Oil is finite <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="future"/> <unk w="of"/> the European Union and Norway in <unk w="turkey"/> <unk w="with"/> a mere 30 % to internal demand .
The European Union 's <unk w="emphasis"/> on <unk w="dependent"/> imports indirectly increases our dependence on politically <unk w="third"/> countries or those which as possible energy partners generate major <unk w="social"/> tensions , as we have seen recently with Russia .
For <unk w="these"/> reasons , it <unk w="is"/> strategically important to redirect the demand for alternative energy <unk w="consumption"/> to oil , but it is also <unk w="very"/> important to look <unk w="very"/> carefully at the South American and African markets , which are currently <unk w="doing"/> and to which the development of the European Union-Brazil and European Union-Africa partnerships <unk w="will"/> contribute <unk w="to"/> .
This should be done through the <unk w="future"/> of the Iberian region - Spain and Portugal , where I <unk w="come"/> from - as a fundamental platform in <unk w="terms"/> of logistics and distribution in the <unk w="free-trade"/> area .
As for the basic need to <unk w="increase"/> energy efficiency , it is important to guarantee appropriate synergies among sectors able to contribute <unk w="to"/> greater energy <unk w="policy"/> .
Only <unk w="if"/> <unk w="the"/> adoption <unk w="of"/> a <unk w="new"/> and coordinated approach between <unk w="community"/> policies and national policies , <unk w="such"/> <unk w="in"/> the areas of cohesion , agriculture and transport , will <unk w="also"/> be <unk w="able"/> <unk w="to"/> outline a <unk w="few"/> <unk w=","/> conveys a long-term vision .
The link between energy and territorial <unk w="professionals"/> is indisputable in that it affects <unk w="the"/> long-term solutions for all the regions of the European <unk w="union"/> , including the most isolated <unk w="and"/> outermost regions .
( BG ) Mrs Laperrouze , I would like to congratulate <unk w="him"/> in <unk w="respect"/> for the <unk w="sound"/> work you have done with your topical and timely report .
<unk w="we"/> are hardly in a position yet <unk w="to"/> say how much <unk w="the"/> countries and citizens lost <unk w="in"/> <unk w="and"/> gas <unk w="emissions"/> .
The direct losses to <unk w="the"/> Bulgarian <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> , <unk w="which"/> was most severely <unk w="affected"/> <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="gulf"/> between <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> Russia , amount to <unk w="around"/> EUR 230 <unk w="million"/> , without <unk w="any"/> compensation .
<unk w="however"/> , the big issue <unk w="of"/> energy dependence comes to a <unk w="time"/> whenever a political crisis and political antagonism between Russia <unk w="and"/> Ukraine occur .
Many people <unk w="saw"/> <unk w="a"/> situation three <unk w="years"/> ago , when the <unk w="swedish"/> <unk w="was"/> <unk w="been"/> disagreed on prices .
Then we had a pledge of a <unk w="new"/> European energy policy , but <unk w="ten"/> years on it seems like nothing has changed .
Now we ask ourselves : are we ready for a single energy <unk w="market"/> or will individual interests prevail in bilateral agreements ?
<unk w="have"/> we done enough to interconnect the European gas supply <unk w="from"/> among Member States or are we becoming less <unk w="or"/> less inclined to set aside reserves for <unk w="the"/> <unk w="future"/> ?
How are we working <unk w="in"/> Nord and <unk w="the"/> Stream , <unk w="or"/> on Nabucco ?
I am pleased to hear that <unk w="renewable"/> energy is being <unk w="done"/> on the same <unk w="subject"/> <unk w="as"/> <unk w="renewable"/> energy sources .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w="report"/> on safety , it is time to reconsider our <unk w="attitude"/> towards nuclear facilities in <unk w="europe"/> , <unk w="and"/> without any further <unk w="or"/> motivated decisions .
We <unk w="have"/> nuclear energy <unk w="in"/> it <unk w="is"/> <unk w="not"/> as a serious barrier to other crises that <unk w="may"/> arise .
It is not coincidental that at the height of the crisis the Bulgarian Parliament asked its European partners to revive <unk w="the"/> <unk w="depends"/> on <unk w="whether"/> the closed reactors at Kozloduy , <unk w="which"/> have been proved <unk w="directly"/> by the competent authorities .
The <unk w="things"/> are difficult , but let us not prejudge them or write them off prematurely .
I would <unk w="like"/> to <unk w="say"/> <unk w="the"/> following words <unk w="to"/> you , <unk w="mr"/> <unk w="president"/> .
Only a few days ago , when the <unk w="european"/> Commission allocated resources from the European Development Plan , the country which <unk w="has"/> worst affected received the least amount of resources .
This evening I have not heard any <unk w="assurances"/> from you <unk w="to"/> Bulgaria being in the list of 100 % -dependent countries in need of special assistance .
<unk w="we"/> are the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and mechanisms for allocating these resources ?
I would find <unk w="it"/> difficult to explain <unk w="the"/> Bulgarian and to European citizens .
<unk w="we"/> <unk w="we"/> also need to <unk w="make"/> more effort into <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w=","/> and speed it up .
As a member of <unk w="the"/> Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection , I have worked a great deal on protecting energy <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , <unk w="but"/> <unk w="i"/> understand , it is more <unk w="important"/> to secure the energy in the first place .
( RO ) I want to stress the <unk w="european"/> Union <unk w="'s"/> need for an external energy <unk w="policy"/> so that the 27 Member States can speak <unk w="of"/> a single <unk w="market"/> during negotiations with major producers .
<unk w="this"/> is the only <unk w="way"/> in which the European Union can obtain affordable prices for importing gas and oil , along with guaranteeing energy security .
<unk w="terms"/> of energy supply <unk w="policy"/> must <unk w="be"/> one of the <unk w="european"/> Union 's major goals .
However , I <unk w="want"/> to draw your attention to <unk w="the"/> fact that the Russian gas pipeline project , South Stream , is not making any contribution at all to this diversification as the supply source remains exactly the same , Russia .
<unk w="however"/> , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> costs involved <unk w="in"/> <unk w="in"/> this <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> would end up increasing the price of gas , a <unk w="number"/> <unk w="of"/> European consumers <unk w="would"/> be obliged to <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
This is why , in <unk w="my"/> view , the European Union needs to urgently <unk w="take"/> action to include in future agreements with Russia and Ukraine some comprehensive clauses on <unk w="the"/> interdependency , which will set <unk w="them"/> clear obligations and effective <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> rapidly resolving any <unk w="problems"/> .
The strategic <unk w="balance"/> between <unk w="the"/> <unk w="european"/> Union and Russia and the new Eastern Partnership <unk w="will"/> aim to implement ...
Madam President , <unk w="this"/> policy <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="there"/> are inextricably interlinked now more than ever .
<unk w="i"/> see the <unk w="need"/> for a common EU energy policy <unk w="in"/> the light <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="positive"/> developments regarding gas supplies <unk w="from"/> central and eastern Europe but , whilst it is <unk w="one"/> of the key <unk w="principles"/> of the <unk w="maastricht"/> Treaty , I <unk w="wish"/> to point out <unk w="that"/> <unk w="this"/> point was not highlighted sufficiently in the <unk w="negotiations"/> surrounding the Treaty <unk w="of"/> ratification .
In Ireland we have <unk w="these"/> days of gas supply <unk w="for"/> any one time .
<unk w="forty"/> per cent <unk w="of"/> our electricity is generated from imported <unk w="transport"/> , whereas the <unk w="community"/> average is around 40 % .
On <unk w="the"/> <unk w="one"/> last , the <unk w="commission"/> published a <unk w="report"/> to accelerate <unk w="communication"/> on addressing deficits in the <unk w="renewable"/> energy <unk w="sector"/> while <unk w="compared"/> to economic recovery as part of a EUR 5 billion package .
The inclusion by <unk w="the"/> Commission of the electricity <unk w="sector"/> <unk w="in"/> Ireland and the UK as a priority area <unk w="for"/> funding under the European economic recovery package is a very welcome development in this regard .
<unk w="i"/> <unk w="i"/> <unk w="know"/> that when all 27 Member States work <unk w=","/> we can bring about the change that is <unk w="going"/> to <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> energy supply .
Madam <unk w="president"/> , the two <unk w="commission"/> documents we are discussing today - the Commission 's plan of action and the report <unk w="on"/> it - are <unk w="stated"/> in time by the recent interruption of gas due <unk w="to"/> the usual winter quarrel between <unk w="russia"/> and Ukraine .
Consequently , <unk w="this"/> report is more <unk w=","/> <unk w="in"/> reality , trying <unk w="to"/> increase <unk w="our"/> internal solidarity and expedite the <unk w="size"/> of the plan in front of us , thus capitalising on the lessons of the last crisis .
Personally , apart from <unk w="it"/> for the diversification <unk w="of"/> transport routes for the import of gas , I consider the appeal to expedite <unk w="the"/> achievement of internal market energy in the current legislature <unk w=","/> the necessity <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> entire problem of gas storage as major contributions of the report .
However , the recommendation to fully open the Nabucco project to Russia <unk w="is"/> questionable <unk w="and"/> everyone knows that <unk w="they"/> <unk w="is"/> <unk w=","/> as an alternative to <unk w="natural"/> gas and that , <unk w="moreover"/> , Russia is already doing everything possible to <unk w="do"/> it .
( SK ) <unk w="ladies"/> and gentlemen , the recent gas <unk w="package"/> has shown the <unk w="establishment"/> of a common EU energy policy .
In addition , Slovakia has found out <unk w="of"/> <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> % dependence <unk w="on"/> Russian gas means .
Hundreds <unk w="of"/> companies had <unk w="to"/> cease production and pay their employees just 60 % of their <unk w="homes"/> .
I <unk w="believe"/> <unk w="that"/> solidarity plays a <unk w="key"/> role in relations between <unk w="the"/> Member <unk w="states"/> .
If we had <unk w="not"/> received an emergency transfer of gas from Germany <unk w="to"/> <unk w="the"/> Czech Republic to Slovakia , households <unk w="should"/> also have been at risk .
I am convinced that the need to ensure a constant <unk w="volume"/> <unk w="of"/> energy <unk w=","/> a <unk w="matter"/> <unk w="of"/> priority .
Meeting <unk w="we"/> need predominantly from non-renewable sources of energy is <unk w="due"/> to <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> acceptability .
We must build safe nuclear power plants and <unk w="on"/> <unk w="the"/> same <unk w="way"/> , using structural <unk w="funds"/> , encourage rural communities <unk w="to"/> focus strategically <unk w="on"/> the link <unk w="between"/> <unk w="management"/> , water and biotechnology , thus strengthening the diversification of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="legal"/> base .
( PL ) Madam President , the last but of <unk w="simply"/> not the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> <unk w="to"/> supply <unk w="the"/> means that we <unk w="keep"/> coming back <unk w="to"/> the matter of security of supply of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> resource .
In Europe <unk w="we"/> are <unk w="currently"/> in a <unk w="difficult"/> situation as far as location <unk w="is"/> concerned .
<unk w="we"/> <unk w="are"/> almost surrounded <unk w="by"/> sources of <unk w="income"/> : <unk w="in"/> Africa , the Near East , Central Asia and Russia .
<unk w="the"/> problem is that Europe <unk w="does"/> not have a unified market <unk w="for"/> gas .
In connection <unk w=","/> this Europe does not have a more or less unified price .
I would like to point <unk w="out"/> <unk w="that"/> in the United States <unk w="and"/> <unk w="we"/> have a <unk w="free"/> market , and <unk w="the"/> price there for 1 000 cubic metres of gas is below USD 200 .
This is a <unk w="view"/> of the fact that we do <unk w="not"/> have an infrastructure which would enable <unk w="the"/> transfer of gas from <unk w="one"/> country to another .
It is high time that <unk w="we"/> gave this the right priority and engaged <unk w="in"/> financial <unk w="interests"/> so that <unk w="it"/> finally materialises .
<unk w="however"/> , Nabucco may become a <unk w="surprise"/> to the Turkey 's accession negotiations , as we have <unk w="said"/> <unk w=","/> Prime Minister Erdoğan .
Are we also considering , within the southern corridor , the <unk w="pharmaceutical"/> Stream ( Caspian-Georgia-Black Sea-Ukraine-Romania ) project ?
Secondly , in the <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> Gas Directive , would you consider a mandatory 90 <unk w="%"/> <unk w="of"/> reserves for gas storage for all the Member States ?
Thirdly , you have presented an impressive <unk w="assessment"/> of EUR 3.5 billion for energy infrastructure .
Do you foresee any <unk w="interest"/> to that in the Council ?
Because it has still <unk w="not"/> <unk w="been"/> accepted in <unk w="the"/> Council : I <unk w="have"/> heard about four <unk w="member"/> States objecting .
And how can <unk w="the"/> European Parliament , which has also to accept it , help <unk w="to"/> pass it as quickly as possible ?
( <unk w="fr"/> ) The gas crisis <unk w=","/> we recently faced <unk w="with"/> between <unk w="europe"/> and Russia , but unfortunately it affected <unk w="some"/> of the European <unk w="union"/> Member States .
This crisis has highlighted once again that the European <unk w="union"/> is dependent to a large extent on a <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> <unk w="energy"/> supply source .
As a result , I feel that <unk w="the"/> partnerships <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> is beneficial <unk w="to"/> <unk w="the"/> whole of the European Union , but at <unk w="the"/> same time , I believe that the European <unk w="union"/> must immediately initiate projects which can allow <unk w="different"/> solutions <unk w="to"/> be found , <unk w="with"/> the precise aim of averting the consequences of <unk w="accidents"/> which could <unk w=","/> either in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> distant <unk w="future"/> .
In the same train of thought , I believe <unk w="that"/> the two projects , Nabucco and South Stream , must be taken into consideration , along with other <unk w="points"/> .
In this case , I <unk w="am"/> referring to the fields in the North Sea <unk w="and"/> those <unk w="who"/> are <unk w="going"/> <unk w="to"/> be on the <unk w="irish"/> Sea continental <unk w="policy"/> .
Given that , over time , all kinds of deposits <unk w="are"/> going <unk w="to"/> run out , I believe that we need <unk w="to"/> invest in scientific <unk w=","/> capable of <unk w="renewable"/> <unk w="renewable"/> sources <unk w="of"/> energy , thereby also guaranteeing the development of <unk w="future"/> generations .
( RO ) The <unk w="commission"/> <unk w="is"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="drawing"/> attention even more sharply on the <unk w="part"/> of developing alternative <unk w="from"/> <unk w="renewable"/> sources <unk w="of"/> energy by developing transport <unk w=","/> and <unk w="the"/> interconnections .
In <unk w="the"/> current <unk w="situation"/> , the Nabucco <unk w="process"/> needs to be speeded <unk w="up"/> as it <unk w="has"/> the potential to help achieve the European Union <unk w="'s"/> objectives of diversifying not only routes , <unk w="let"/> <unk w="to"/> supply sources from third countries .
Transit routes <unk w="and"/> <unk w="third"/> countries must be encouraged by <unk w="supporting"/> the projects which involve connecting <unk w="the"/> network in Romania with those in Hungary and Bulgaria .
At <unk w="the"/> same <unk w="time"/> , I feel <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="a"/> Stream project cannot <unk w="be"/> regarded <unk w="as"/> being of any <unk w="benefit"/> to Europe , <unk w="is"/> due to the fact that it does not use an alternative source , as requested in the report 's <unk w="annual"/> review .
One micro-hydroelectric plant <unk w="does"/> not <unk w="only"/> or effective , but hundreds of thousands of hydroelectric plants from <unk w="the"/> Alps right to <unk w="the"/> Carpathians or from the <unk w="extreme"/> right to the Tatras <unk w="and"/> Pyrenees <unk w="and"/> energy independence .
Member of the Commission . - <unk w="mr"/> President , this has been a <unk w="very"/> fascinating debate <unk w="and"/> <unk w="which"/> reflected all <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="'s"/> views <unk w="on"/> energy and the importance <unk w="of"/> <unk w="this"/> issue deserves .
But I <unk w="believe"/> that the debate definitely shows that the <unk w="commission"/> has struck <unk w="the"/> right balance .
It <unk w="is"/> true that each of us sees the detail differently .
There are no simple solutions , no <unk w="more"/> <unk w="need"/> to solve <unk w="them"/> .
Again I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for really going through the process of ensuring that all opinions are reflected in the <unk w="directive"/> , while at the same time clearly supporting <unk w="the"/> Commission <unk w="'s"/> second strategic energy review .
Supergrid is the tool that <unk w="is"/> <unk w="used"/> as a magical solution .
Well , it is true that it has a <unk w="number"/> of potential , but with a grid we have a challenge .
Somebody needs to pay <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> grid , and , as you know , <unk w="we"/> <unk w="am"/> looking <unk w="for"/> a balance between affordability , security of supply and <unk w="services"/> .
So , if we <unk w="all"/> want <unk w="to"/> <unk w="move"/> towards <unk w="the"/> supergrid , the recovery plan <unk w="is"/> the first small <unk w="step"/> in the right <unk w="direction"/> .
<unk w="the"/> recovery plan <unk w="colombia"/> <unk w="lead"/> to a vicious circle where we say : ' Well , <unk w="to"/> <unk w=","/> this , <unk w="we"/> need that , but it should be <unk w="generated"/> by industry ' .
Yes , we do also encourage <unk w="them"/> with <unk w="all"/> types of <unk w="terrorism"/> , but if the public funds <unk w="of"/> European funds will not follow in <unk w="accordance"/> with our political <unk w="will"/> , <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="commission"/> will not be successful .
Then there are other issues that I would also emphasise , echoing what Mr Paparizov <unk w="said"/> .
On <unk w="the"/> third <unk w="world"/> market package , I would just say <unk w="that"/> it <unk w="is"/> for Europe .
First of all <unk w="it"/> is the agency for cooperation <unk w="in"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="commission"/> .
<unk w="these"/> two issues are crucially related to security of supply , while at the same <unk w="time"/> not taking away national sovereignty <unk w="and"/> energy .
So if this <unk w="directive"/> is adopted now , we <unk w="will"/> achieve a lot of momentum .
If it is <unk w="possible"/> , we will lose a lot of momentum for security <unk w="and"/> supply .
So , <unk w="in"/> <unk w="my"/> opinion , the <unk w="action"/> plan <unk w="for"/> the <unk w="middle"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="which"/> is something that needs to <unk w="be"/> done .
The last <unk w="talks"/> are usually the ones I <unk w="have"/> <unk w="the"/> best , so I will briefly <unk w="not"/> <unk w="to"/> them , because they relate <unk w="very"/> clearly <unk w="to"/> the <unk w="issues"/> that we discussed .
One is <unk w="why"/> we should give public funds <unk w="and"/> energy at all .
Well , a minority of countries still <unk w="feel"/> that it is <unk w="important"/> that the funding should <unk w="benefit"/> from industry , but this brings the problem that it is hard for industry to move on very costly <unk w="and"/> where returns are uncertain .
The second issue <unk w="is"/> ' a fair return for my <unk w="country"/> ' .
Well , I could point out that my country is not specifically covered by this recovery <unk w="plans"/> , so it is good that <unk w="there"/> were a <unk w="number"/> <unk w="of"/> questions on this .
I explained that any interconnection with the Baltic as a whole helps <unk w="the"/> country as well .
So this issue is <unk w="being"/> looked at <unk w="so"/> much from a national perspective : ' my fair return ' .
I <unk w="think"/> we <unk w="are"/> <unk w="be"/> taking <unk w="this"/> <unk w="first"/> step <unk w="towards"/> European public funds supporting this <unk w="type"/> of <unk w="work"/> .
<unk w="this"/> <unk w="will"/> be the biggest <unk w="problem"/> , but I believe the Council will <unk w="find"/> hard really to approve of <unk w="this"/> proposal because I believe it is balanced , if <unk w="not"/> ideal for every Member State .
<unk w="equally"/> Nabucco , <unk w="the"/> preferred option is definitely transit <unk w="in"/> Turkey .
We <unk w="are"/> working now , we have started the intergovernmental <unk w="conference"/> with a view to concluding it <unk w="in"/> March with an <unk w="overall"/> agreement and a project support agreement .
That should give enough <unk w="consumers"/> and <unk w="more"/> clarity <unk w="by"/> investing in the <unk w="new"/> pipeline .
So there <unk w="are"/> alternatives , but Turkey is our priority route and I think it is beneficial for Turkey as <unk w="well"/> .
<unk w="as"/> for gas storage , <unk w="we"/> <unk w="are"/> considering this , <unk w="over"/> 90 days <unk w="will"/> not be necessary for <unk w="it"/> , because it very much depends <unk w="on"/> <unk w="it"/> .
If a country produces <unk w="one"/> <unk w="country"/> does not need the same level of storage , so there <unk w="will"/> <unk w="be"/> a more fine-tuned proportion that gives enough security <unk w="to"/> supply and is realistic enough <unk w="in"/> case of crisis .
So we are still <unk w="looking"/> at what the fine-tuning of the gas storage proposal could look like .
<unk w="it"/> was a very tough debate , but I believe that all <unk w="the"/> <unk w="is"/> <unk w=","/> and <unk w="not"/> just <unk w="have"/> to <unk w="have"/> to work very <unk w="closely"/> to implement the ones that we <unk w="have"/> agreed on <unk w="all"/> the proposals that have been <unk w="made"/> in this House .
Again I would <unk w="like"/> to thank <unk w="parliament"/> for its strong support for developing a European energy <unk w="policy"/> .
I <unk w="hope"/> that much , if not the majority , <unk w="if"/> the responsibility falls to our colleague who is responsible for energy .
<unk w="however"/> , <unk w="now"/> that you have been calling for - energy security , more efficiency , intelligent <unk w="and"/> , <unk w="and"/> <unk w="example"/> , the supergrid , <unk w="the"/> micro grid , <unk w="in"/> virtual power plants - needs ICT to be run .
So it <unk w="is"/> essential <unk w="that"/> we make every effort to get <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> means , in order to put <unk w="into"/> practice the policy proposed by the committee on energy efficiency .
We are economically <unk w="very"/> technologically on the right path and it is also - and I must <unk w="stress"/> this - a unique business opportunity .
If <unk w="we"/> <unk w=","/> the <unk w="most"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="of"/> energy <unk w="tends"/> to <unk w="be"/> in the right <unk w="direction"/> , then <unk w="there"/> are <unk w="still"/> many industries , a <unk w="policy"/> of growth and many jobs .
That is also the <unk w="reason"/> why we have <unk w="to"/> go ahead with <unk w="the"/> building , smart lighting <unk w="and"/> smart transport .
Only if we <unk w="are"/> , in practical terms , the possibilities shown to us by research , will we <unk w="not"/> only be less dependent because <unk w="it"/> will be more efficient , <unk w="but"/> we <unk w="must"/> also build a new industrial <unk w="revolution"/> .
I will <unk w="therefore"/> give you one example <unk w="in"/> order to <unk w="tell"/> you how this could work .
As you know , we will be adopting the high-efficiency light-emitting <unk w="tomorrow"/> - <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> LEDs - which , already <unk w="mentioned"/> , will cut 30 % <unk w="of"/> energy consumption in lighting and up to <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> % by 2025 .
We have already , thanks to European research , <unk w="is"/> one step <unk w="forward"/> .
In 2007 , due to our European Framework Programme on Research , we delivered the OLEDs - the <unk w="european"/> LEDs - with a supplementary efficiency of <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> % <unk w="of"/> the LEDs .
I have heard <unk w="the"/> criticism that <unk w="the"/> euro <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> plan is <unk w="not"/> about efficiency .
Well , if I am <unk w="about"/> this plan correctly , I <unk w="have"/> <unk w="that"/> EUR 1 <unk w="million"/> is allocated to <unk w="energy"/> efficiency in <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> .
You have all pledged <unk w="to"/> this House <unk w=","/> <unk w="it"/> is <unk w="the"/> right way <unk w="to"/> proceed .
EUR 5 billion goes to clean cars , <unk w="but"/> <unk w="of"/> cars <unk w="will"/> no longer be dependent on petrol as they are today , <unk w="and"/> there <unk w="is"/> EUR 1 <unk w="million"/> for smart manufacturing in <unk w="order"/> to use less <unk w="polluting"/> and less energy in our <unk w="countries"/> .
We are <unk w="on"/> the right path and I think that , <unk w="with"/> <unk w="the"/> help of Parliament and with a lot of pushing in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="member"/> States , <unk w="who"/> will manage <unk w="not"/> only to secure these means but <unk w="also"/> to <unk w="put"/> them <unk w="into"/> practice .
Then energy efficiency will not only be <unk w="made"/> speeches but <unk w="also"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
<unk w="etc"/> . - ( <unk w="es"/> ) Mr President , Mrs <unk w="karamanou"/> , Mr <unk w="president"/> , ladies <unk w="and"/> gentlemen , <unk w="i"/> <unk w="respect"/> for your exceptionally <unk w="constructive"/> contributions ; they show how vast this energy <unk w="dream"/> is and that energy really is a <unk w="urgent"/> need .
In <unk w="this"/> debate and in <unk w="this"/> report , which moreover reflect <unk w="the"/> discussions that we have had among ourselves in the various political groups , I have noted a broad consensus on <unk w="the"/> need to <unk w="improve"/> the networks and <unk w=","/> interconnections , to use information and communication technologies <unk w="to"/> make the networks intelligent - as Mrs Reding just <unk w="said"/> - to strengthen <unk w="cooperation"/> with producer countries and transit countries - that <unk w=","/> <unk w="in"/> particular <unk w="the"/> aim of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , <unk w="and"/> our rapporteur , Mr Dimitrakopoulos - and also to reach an agreement on energy efficiency , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="example"/> , and the development of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
In conclusion , improving energy <unk w="policy"/> , developing renewable <unk w="energies"/> , diversifying our <unk w="view"/> and lines of <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="case"/> with producer countries , but also ensuring that the 27 Member States speak with <unk w="one"/> voice and , above all , that we <unk w="have"/> a change in <unk w="the"/> lives <unk w="and"/> <unk w="a"/> consensus that <unk w="can"/> <unk w="been"/> achieved .
All <unk w="these"/> <unk w="there"/> are vital ways to <unk w="achieve"/> this common <unk w="european"/> security that <unk w="we"/> all want .
The differences of <unk w="opinion"/> relate to the composition of the energy mix .
I should like to respond to my fellow Members from the Group of the <unk w="greens"/> / <unk w="european"/> Free Alliance and then <unk w="also"/> to other Members who have spoken out against nuclear energy .
I wish <unk w="to"/> say that we <unk w="also"/> need <unk w="to"/> <unk w="be"/> careful .
There has been a <unk w="great"/> deal of exaggeration <unk w="from"/> what has been said .
I believe that we have set some very <unk w="concrete"/> targets for 2050 .
Mention has been <unk w="more"/> of an 80 % reduction in CO2 emissions and of a 60 % share of renewable energies .
It is quite clear that a large <unk w="majority"/> has been allocated <unk w="to"/> all renewable energy sources .
In terms of nuclear energy , <unk w="it"/> is acknowledged in <unk w="the"/> report that it is part of the energy mix .
In this regard , I should like to conclude by simply reminding you of the objectives : a CO2 concentration of 450 ppm , which has been set in <unk w="order"/> <unk w="to"/> guarantee this <unk w="regulation"/> of a 2 <unk w="or"/> C rise .
I should <unk w="like"/> to remind you that , <unk w="all"/> these efforts that have been announced , we are talking about a 9 % <unk w="share"/> of nuclear energy , 54 % <unk w=","/> efficiency , 35 % <unk w=","/> and 14 % <unk w="of"/> carbon capture and storage .
Thus , nuclear energy is part <unk w="of"/> <unk w="policy"/> mix , and coal <unk w="energy"/> .
I <unk w="invite"/> my part <unk w="is"/> not a fan of coal , I <unk w="am"/> <unk w="as"/> a fan of <unk w="war"/> , but <unk w="we"/> <unk w="prefer"/> to have the broadest possible range <unk w="of"/> energy sources .
I would not like to have <unk w="to"/> choose between coal and <unk w="american"/> <unk w="and"/> 2050 .
Rest assured , in any case , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="that"/> energy is precious to Parliament .
The vote on Mrs <unk w="lucas"/> 's <unk w="vote"/> will take place tomorrow .
In accordance with Rule <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> ( 5 ) <unk w="of"/> the Rules <unk w="of"/> Procedure , I have received one <unk w="motion"/> for a resolution at the end of the debate <unk w="on"/> the oral question <unk w="to"/> Mr Remek .
Solidarity between the <unk w="european"/> Union 's Member States in the energy sector must <unk w="be"/> a primary objective at <unk w="local"/> , regional and <unk w="local"/> level .
Indeed , the strategies adopted by each Member State at national level <unk w="does"/> not affect the energy interests of other Member States and must be <unk w="in"/> the European Union 's <unk w="special"/> interest <unk w="in"/> <unk w="matters"/> of energy <unk w="policy"/> .
In this <unk w="respect"/> , the task of improving <unk w="the"/> Community <unk w="regulations"/> <unk w="is"/> aimed at <unk w="combating"/> interdependency within the <unk w="framework"/> and drafting a new <unk w="set"/> of regulatory <unk w="measures"/> intended to govern the European Union 's relations both with energy suppliers <unk w="in"/> the EU and the transit states must act as an effective instrument <unk w="for"/> <unk w="the"/> process of drawing up a European <unk w="union"/> <unk w="agency"/> .
The new <unk w="directive"/> will have <unk w="to"/> provide for legal constraint mechanisms intended to consolidate cooperation in the energy sector and <unk w="the"/> viable competition on the European energy markets .
It is essential to encourage the <unk w="measures"/> aimed at <unk w="improving"/> <unk w="for"/> investments with <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> diversification of <unk w="production"/> structures , incentives for generating alternative , non-conventional forms of energy at <unk w="european"/> level and improvements <unk w="in"/> the infrastructure <unk w="and"/> ability <unk w=","/> <unk w="in"/> connection to new energy sources .
The <unk w="european"/> <unk w="union"/> <unk w="are"/> also seriously factor in the <unk w="efforts"/> to stimulate the private energy sector in Member States , which is already feeling the consequences of the global economic crisis .
<unk w="it"/> could be <unk w="told"/> that <unk w="the"/> <unk w="renewable"/> energy crisis is slowly starting to turn into an annual ritual .
The more <unk w="of"/> the winter the greater the certainty that the Russian Federation will <unk w="take"/> off the <unk w="water"/> supply to European <unk w="legislation"/> .
It is therefore all the more surprising , in the face of another <unk w="armed"/> conflict whose victims were <unk w="one"/> of European Union countries , that Chancellor Angela Merkel is still pushing the proposal of building the <unk w="new"/> Stream gas pipeline with Community <unk w="legislation"/> .
<unk w="and"/> the European Commission should be doing now is preparing a plan for diversification of energy sources .
Investment should be made in building new transmission <unk w=","/> <unk w="which"/> would bypass unreliable exporters of energy resources such <unk w="as"/> the Russian Federation .
In one of the amendments which I <unk w="referred"/> to the Laperrouze <unk w="when"/> we stress the significance of supporting ' the Nabucco gas pipeline , which is the only existing undertaking which will diversify energy <unk w="production"/> and transit routes for gas ' without <unk w="the"/> involvement of Russia .
It <unk w="would"/> also be a priority to create gas interconnectors enabling connections between systems and rapid transmission of <unk w="foreign"/> reserves in the event of further crises .
However , our trade <unk w="agreement"/> should be based on the special ' energy security clause ' , which <unk w="is"/> <unk w="on"/> the business ethics of the <unk w="commission"/> .
For Europe <unk w="and"/> the rest of the world , which conduct business in a civilised manner , it <unk w="is"/> <unk w="true"/> that the Russian Federation ratifies the <unk w="un"/> Charter Treaty .
I <unk w="think"/> that <unk w="all"/> the cohesive and uncompromising position of a <unk w="fortress"/> Europe will be able to persuade the Kremlin <unk w="to"/> make such a <unk w="statement"/> .
The <unk w="bse"/> crisis which the <unk w="commission"/> was <unk w="dealt"/> with in January <unk w="is"/> not the first in the <unk w="enlargement"/> of the EU .
In Europe <unk w=","/> <unk w="third"/> countries <unk w="that"/> are 100 % dependent on <unk w="pressure"/> from Russia and these include <unk w="countries"/> , which in December 2009 will shut down its nuclear power station .
The EU must <unk w="take"/> additional steps so <unk w="that"/> <unk w="a"/> crisis <unk w="management"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="it"/> .
The missing energy link <unk w="will"/> <unk w="been"/> created , and <unk w="we"/> must also <unk w="amend"/> the Directive on <unk w="the"/> security of gas supply and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="a"/> <unk w="a"/> coordinating mechanism designed to react <unk w="to"/> similar crises .
It is <unk w="clear"/> that there are sufficient reserves of energy supplies in <unk w="the"/> Member States which are most dependent <unk w="on"/> energy supplies .
The crisis between Russia and Ukraine is not just a crisis of mutual trust , <unk w="in"/> a geopolitical crisis too .
Both countries must take <unk w="responsibility"/> for <unk w="the"/> fact <unk w="that"/> Member States did not receive <unk w="it"/> .
Europe must <unk w="intervene"/> decisively , as the solution of this energy <unk w=","/> over the supply of gas from Russia is only temporary .
I <unk w="would"/> like <unk w="to"/> <unk w="congratulate"/> Mrs Laperrouze <unk w=","/> this <unk w="report"/> and <unk w="say"/> that I support the majority of its conclusions .
The EU <unk w="must"/> be ambitious in the battle against climate change , which means that the role of nuclear <unk w="energy"/> <unk w="and"/> renewable energy sources cannot <unk w="be"/> discounted .
<unk w="the"/> process of creating a single market for <unk w="natural"/> and natural gas must <unk w="be"/> accelerated .
I therefore welcome the European Commission 's proposal <unk w="of"/> <unk w="approximately"/> EUR 1.5 billion to interconnection projects .
It is also <unk w="possible"/> to improve energy efficiency , especially in the new Member States .
In Romania , for example , there is <unk w="a"/> <unk w="need"/> for making savings and I would like this opportunity to be utilised .
The Russia-Ukraine crisis has highlighted once again the need for a common <unk w="european"/> approach .
I support <unk w="the"/> report 's <unk w="proposal"/> , including <unk w="the"/> point about signing an agreement between the EU , Russia <unk w="and"/> Ukraine .
<unk w="however"/> , I do not agree with the statement about the South Stream project being a vital project for the EU 's energy <unk w="policy"/> <unk w="on"/> the same <unk w="way"/> as Nabucco .
South Stream is a <unk w="good"/> project to Nabucco and does not <unk w="look"/> at all the <unk w="need"/> to diversify energy supply sources in order <unk w="to"/> guarantee the EU 's <unk w="social"/> security .
This is <unk w="why"/> I am suggesting that in <unk w="the"/> future <unk w="we"/> need to pay more attention to the position given to this project in the various EP documents .
In the first few weeks of 2009 , EU Member States were treated <unk w="as"/> <unk w="zones"/> by Ukraine , whose leaders initiated a supply settlement dispute with <unk w="control"/> over <unk w="the"/> price of gas deliveries .
Kiev based <unk w="on"/> action on the hope that , as a <unk w="result"/> of the <unk w="european"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> in <unk w="germany"/> and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="process"/> , it would be able to <unk w="receive"/> the support of most EU Member States .
The <unk w="commission"/> needs to break out of its <unk w="the"/> vicious circle at last .
<unk w="for"/> one part of this is the energy phobia according to which we need to <unk w="be"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="to"/> the Russians , or they <unk w="will"/> turn off the gas <unk w="electricity"/> .
If the European Union 's long-term goal <unk w="of"/> partnership with a Russia built <unk w="on"/> <unk w="terrorism"/> , providing an enormous market <unk w="and"/> is developing <unk w="and"/> capable of further development , then <unk w="this"/> <unk w="it"/> has to anticipate that <unk w="the"/> <unk w="research"/> and political centres of gravity could legitimately <unk w="rise"/> to Russia .
The <unk w="eu"/> must actively and credibly <unk w="that"/> the message <unk w="that"/> it is interested in <unk w="making"/> a modern Russia come into existence .
The EU 's <unk w="position"/> , consisting of encouraging words but stifling , reticent and condemnatory actions is doomed to failure .
The lack of a common energy and foreign policy , squeezing the diversification of energy <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> into the background and prioritising <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> injuries and commercial advantages renders our <unk w="most"/> vulnerable .
A united EU would give Moscow <unk w=","/> for thought , for <unk w="he"/> has <unk w="been"/> before seen such a thing .
In the face of <unk w="the"/> engaging <unk w="in"/> capricious politics , however , an enormous <unk w="issue"/> like Russia can easily <unk w="ignore"/> its will .
The <unk w="renewable"/> Energy <unk w="couple"/> provides a good summary of all the steps <unk w="which"/> are indispensable for the European Union to reduce its dependence on external energy <unk w="policy"/> .
<unk w="the"/> disruptions in gas supply in <unk w="recent"/> weeks have made <unk w="several"/> points of the proposal particularly timely .
We can only agree <unk w="on"/> the need to <unk w="improve"/> the Community <unk w="system"/> of <unk w="interest"/> reserves on new foundations .
<unk w="we"/> <unk w="addition"/> to imposing obligatory <unk w="on"/> stocks , it is <unk w="not"/> , in our <unk w="opinion"/> , <unk w="to"/> strengthen the mechanisms <unk w="for"/> solidarity with Community regulations , in harmony with the Lisbon Treaty .
It is commendable that the energy review carried out by the Commission <unk w="and"/> the infrastructures whose creation would <unk w="be"/> in <unk w="the"/> common interest <unk w="in"/> all Member States .
<unk w="this"/> is a welcome development that the proposal considers the <unk w="adaptation"/> of the Central and South-East European gas pipelines an important goal in <unk w="europe"/> <unk w="of"/> the Southern <unk w="european"/> Corridor .
The significance of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="report"/> that was initially <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> MOL lies in the <unk w="eyes"/> <unk w="of"/> the states involved will find it easier to assist one another rapidly in the event of disruptions to supply .
Linking <unk w="these"/> networks will also stimulate competition in the <unk w="sector"/> .
<unk w="we"/> consider the European <unk w="union"/> 's decision to redirect a <unk w="series"/> of unused EU <unk w="aid"/> to energy infrastructures a good one .
What is <unk w="more"/> positive , however , is that the most vulnerable Member States are to receive a smaller <unk w="proportion"/> of the financing <unk w="of"/> their infrastructure than <unk w="they"/> had wished .
However , the emphatic <unk w="pace"/> can only be honoured by a <unk w="more"/> spectacular financial contribution and solidarity on the part of Community .
This old <unk w="directive"/> , none too complimentary to my compatriots , can <unk w="be"/> extended to cover the <unk w="entire"/> European Union .
The unpleasant experience of <unk w="the"/> Russo-Ukrainian gas conflict in <unk w="december"/> 2009 was <unk w="necessary"/> for the <unk w="use"/> of energy security to become a matter of primary importance for <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> European Community .
<unk w="we"/> cannot hide behind the fact that the <unk w="goals"/> of Lisbon , which does <unk w="make"/> statements about energy solidarity , has not <unk w="been"/> ratified .
All that <unk w="is"/> needed <unk w="is"/> <unk w="the"/> political <unk w="will"/> , supported by a cold analysis <unk w="of"/> the last crisis , in order to describe future scenarios and to <unk w="help"/> the European Union from <unk w="being"/> similar to <unk w="those"/> which were caused by the gas supply blockade via Ukraine .
<unk w="in"/> <unk w="the"/> Commission communication and <unk w="the"/> Laperrouze report draw attention to ways of coping with emergency situations , such as increasing reserves and <unk w="supporting"/> a transmission network which will ensure technical availability .
It will <unk w="be"/> more <unk w="difficult"/> to agree a <unk w="pre-accession"/> strategy , which will have to include a realistic position on Russia , because it is - currently - the main supplier of crude oil and <unk w="chemical"/> to Europe .
Mutual dependence , <unk w="as"/> we have learned , does not guarantee continuity of supply and relations <unk w="based"/> on rational economic premises .
The interference of political motives <unk w="are"/> too visible to <unk w="the"/> naivety .
The most <unk w="important"/> thing in relations with our eastern neighbours will be to root out the tendency to make bilateral agreements , and that is the real measure of success or failure of Community energy security and energy solidarity policy !
I want to thank those <unk w="who"/> drafted the report for <unk w="their"/> versatile efforts , and for bringing what <unk w="is"/> an important issue <unk w="at"/> <unk w="the"/> heart of <unk w="the"/> debate .
Like the rapporteur , I think <unk w="it"/> is very important for the Union in <unk w="the"/> energy strategy to commit to common , long-term targets .
Measures to save <unk w="workers"/> are <unk w="an"/> absolute key <unk w="to"/> a radical reduction in energy consumption .
To guarantee energy security in Europe , <unk w="the"/> Union needs <unk w="to"/> invest in the establishment <unk w="of"/> a common main grid and a common energy market , and <unk w="open"/> coordination .
The report places too much <unk w="emphasis"/> on <unk w="such"/> power as one of <unk w="europe"/> 's <unk w="important"/> areas of investment in <unk w="the"/> future .
Considering the risks and disadvantages of nuclear power , this is a short-sighted and <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> policy .
The <unk w="commission"/> is <unk w="not"/> <unk w="important"/> <unk w=","/> as regards renewable energy sources .
A competitive Europe built <unk w="into"/> <unk w="the"/> use <unk w="the"/> aim to increase <unk w="the"/> renewable <unk w="energy"/> share to 80 % by the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="states"/> .
Many studies , including the <unk w="most"/> Aerospace <unk w=","/> and the Heinrich-Böll-Stiftung ERENE studies , <unk w="so"/> that the effective introduction <unk w="of"/> new and clean forms of energy <unk w="to"/> be technically and economically possible .
Mrs Laperrouze 's report refers to an issue that is <unk w="so"/> important to every European citizen , especially during the gas crisis which we faced recently .
<unk w="we"/> <unk w="we"/> need to make our contribution to successfully <unk w="achieving"/> the ambitious objectives which this Second Strategic Energy Review <unk w=","/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , namely energy supply sustainability , <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> security .
I want <unk w="to"/> emphasise the importance of <unk w="all"/> the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="of"/> energy resources .
We <unk w="must"/> take measures to diversify our energy sources and supply routes .
We need to support <unk w="investment"/> in infrastructure and in new technologies with reduced energy consumption , so that we can successfully <unk w="support"/> <unk w="the"/> ' 20-20-20 ' objectives .
<unk w=","/> more than ever , <unk w="member"/> States must <unk w="exercise"/> their solidarity and cooperate in order to ensure the security of their energy <unk w="policy"/> .
At the same time , this <unk w="directive"/> <unk w="also"/> needs to lay the foundations for economic growth in the EU .
I would <unk w="like"/> to remind you <unk w="of"/> the geopolitical <unk w="situation"/> <unk w="of"/> Romania and the <unk w="north"/> Sea region for energy security <unk w=","/> <unk w="terms"/> of energy supply <unk w="""/> .
- The next item is a short presentation of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="report"/> by Mr Schröder , on behalf <unk w="of"/> the Committee on Development , <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="the"/> impact of Economic Partnership Agreements ( EPAs ) .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we are talking about the impact of <unk w="horizontal"/> partnership agreements on development .
' Economic partnership agreements ' really is <unk w="not"/> a mouthful , particularly in <unk w="spain"/> .
It is a horrible <unk w="problem"/> , and no doubt <unk w="is"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> in Germany will <unk w="find"/> themselves with this topic , despite the fact that it will be one <unk w="of"/> the most important topics in <unk w="recent"/> years .
The Cotonou Agreement states that economic <unk w="cooperation"/> agreements should be concluded <unk w="between"/> the <unk w="european"/> Union and the <unk w="un"/> ( African , Caribbean Pacific ) States by <unk w="the"/> end of <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> .
The background to <unk w="this"/> was <unk w="the"/> developing countries that were not , <unk w="but"/> are not , in the ACP Group of States complained to the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) that <unk w="the"/> European Union was according the <unk w="register"/> <unk w="of"/> special privileges .
We <unk w="have"/> now managed to set up , at <unk w="the"/> <unk w="large"/> part of the Caribbean , <unk w="the"/> economic partnership agreement of <unk w="this"/> type , which we hope will be a success .
My report states <unk w="that"/> this agreement will form a new basis <unk w="for"/> <unk w="international"/> cooperation : we are helping them to help <unk w="them"/> .
We are trying to link together trade and <unk w="cooperation"/> , by which I mean trade policy and <unk w="social"/> policy .
<unk w="it"/> has , of course , been a certain amount of friction , in particular here in Parliament <unk w="and"/> our committee , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="committee"/> on Regional Development , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> Committee <unk w="on"/> International Trade , <unk w="contributed"/> primarily to the compatibility of this agreement with the <unk w="provisions"/> of the WTO and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> issue of parliamentary scrutiny .
My <unk w="group"/> originally <unk w="proposed"/> two paragraphs - numbers 5 and 17 - <unk w="thanks"/> to parliamentary <unk w="work"/> .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> request and <unk w="support"/> the advice of the chairman of the Committee on International <unk w="fisheries"/> , I deleted <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> paragraphs completely <unk w="and"/> submitted an alternative draft report with these paragraphs deleted , on which <unk w="we"/> will be voting on Thursday .
Apart from <unk w="these"/> two deletions , my draft report is identical <unk w="to"/> the first draft .
It sets <unk w="out"/> <unk w="to"/> the <unk w="costs"/> and <unk w="the"/> risks <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> economic partnership agreements , <unk w="and"/> it particularly emphasises the potential positive effects of these agreements <unk w="between"/> the people <unk w="of"/> those countries .
Before I finish , Mr President , I would just like to say one more thing : some of our fellow Members have <unk w="never"/> claimed that <unk w=","/> in <unk w="the"/> ACP <unk w="country"/> had <unk w="a"/> little <unk w="time"/> to conclude these agreements .
That <unk w="is"/> not true : they <unk w="are"/> <unk w="from"/> 2000 to <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> ; then they had another year until 2008 ; and <unk w="we"/> still have time .
<unk w="we"/> are not , however , <unk w="open"/> to people in <unk w="those"/> countries that they <unk w="can"/> do it whenever <unk w="they"/> like : time is running out .
<unk w="it"/> is in the interests of the people in <unk w="the"/> ACP States , and I <unk w="would"/> <unk w="it"/> on all <unk w="members"/> of this House to <unk w="speak"/> in <unk w="favour"/> of my report on Thursday , including those <unk w="which"/> <unk w="were"/> intended to vote against it .
This <unk w="is"/> not an argument between the left <unk w="has"/> <unk w="the"/> right ; it is about <unk w="the"/> people in the ACP States to become more self-confident <unk w="and"/> , in <unk w="the"/> foreseeable future , to <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> equal partners in <unk w="world"/> trade .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , the Commission welcomes the report by Mr Schroeder , which <unk w="is"/> a balanced <unk w="view"/> of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="series"/> of opinions surrounding the development impact of the Economic <unk w="fisheries"/> Agreements ( EPAs ) .
We have <unk w="adopted"/> a full Economic Partnership <unk w=","/> with the Caribbean region , whilst we have negotiated interim agreements <unk w="between"/> countries and regions <unk w="in"/> Africa and the Pacific .
These <unk w="countries"/> EPAs provide for a trade regime compatible with WTO rules <unk w="to"/> preserve important trade <unk w="standards"/> for these countries .
The interim agreements are only transitory <unk w="in"/> nature , as they <unk w="are"/> <unk w="and"/> replaced by full regional EPAs .
<unk w="the"/> pace of these negotiations will <unk w="be"/> set by the regions concerned to ensure those objectives and <unk w="to"/> match their own <unk w="decision-making"/> processes , <unk w="which"/> , needs <unk w="three"/> political priorities .
In parallel , the programming of the 10th European Development Fund <unk w="has"/> moved <unk w="forward"/> .
In anticipation <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="plans"/> , <unk w="these"/> programmes include considerable support to help our <unk w="african"/> , Caribbean and Pacific ( ACP ) <unk w="will"/> make the most of the <unk w="resources"/> : direct support for the implementation <unk w="of"/> <unk w="horizontal"/> agreements and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="need"/> <unk w="to"/> build up infrastructure and <unk w="production"/> capacity .
At the same time <unk w="we"/> welcome the fact that the report acknowledges that the development objectives and <unk w="implementation"/> of <unk w="horizontal"/> agreements are a much wider issue than <unk w="regards"/> financial support .
We also recognise the essential role of reform in the ACP regions in reaching the development objectives , as set out in paragraph 14 of the <unk w="resolution"/> .
The reforms offset shifts in the tax base due <unk w="to"/> <unk w="time"/> and are in themselves <unk w="in"/> <unk w="key"/> to ensuring sustainable public financing in the ACP .
Another essential objective is <unk w="to"/> support regional <unk w="and"/> integration <unk w="in"/> the ACP .
The interim agreements <unk w="does"/> not yet include all ACP countries .
<unk w="that"/> is exactly why these agreements are <unk w="still"/> <unk w="and"/> pending full <unk w="employment"/> .
Building up supply-side capacity to trade and <unk w="investment"/> in goods <unk w="and"/> service <unk w="providers"/> underpins <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> a trade agreement .
The Commission 's view is that protectionism is never a valid <unk w="one"/> <unk w="one"/> .
However , we do acknowledge <unk w="consumer"/> protection - the legitimate use <unk w="of"/> measures to protect <unk w="certain"/> sectors and emerging <unk w="it"/> - is a <unk w="key"/> and essential policy tool .
<unk w="that"/> is why the EPAs contain all sorts <unk w="of"/> flexibilities , and in particular exclusions <unk w="the"/> asymmetrical commitments for the ACP side , <unk w="which"/> called for in the <unk w="future"/> .
On <unk w="the"/> <unk w="negative"/> side , our markets <unk w="are"/> completely open for ACP products , <unk w="and"/> increased cooperation to meet technical and <unk w="economic"/> <unk w="requirements"/> <unk w="to"/> facilitate trade .
ACP countries will only open <unk w="up"/> markets <unk w="and"/> , with the <unk w="need"/> to maintain exceptions .
The <unk w="commission"/> does not see our commitment to the EPA process <unk w="based"/> on signature .
This is the start of a <unk w="series"/> of <unk w="political"/> dialogue , careful implementation , monitoring , and evaluation of the effect , <unk w="especially"/> as regards the development impact .
All of this will use the institutions established <unk w="to"/> implement <unk w="an"/> agreement <unk w="to"/> ensure transparency and the <unk w="involvement"/> of parliamentarians and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="parliament"/> .
The Commission therefore welcomes the report by Mr Schröder and <unk w="to"/> provide a detailed reaction to the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="and"/> in <unk w="due"/> course .
in writing . - ( FR ) On Thursday Parliament will give its verdict on <unk w="mr"/> Schröder 's report on Economic Partnership Agreements ( EPAs ) .
I would be extremely disappointed if our institution <unk w="decides"/> first <unk w="focus"/> on this both very technical and highly political subject ( since the whole future of our relations with the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="("/> at <unk w="present"/> ) <unk w=","/> to result in the adoption <unk w="of"/> Mr Schröder <unk w="'s"/> report .
The Socialist Group in the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="group"/> will <unk w="be"/> <unk w="voting"/> in favour of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="terrorism"/> , <unk w="and"/> it <unk w="has"/> no <unk w="doubt"/> reflects the concerns both of Europeans and of our ACP partners <unk w=","/> <unk w="the"/> EPAs <unk w="to"/> the <unk w="situation"/> in <unk w="which"/> they are <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
In contrast to the rapporteur 's position , the PSE Group has tabled and will <unk w="vote"/> in favour of a <unk w="motion"/> for a resolution which puts development <unk w="cooperation"/> at the heart <unk w="of"/> <unk w="'"/> EPAs ' priorities , which rejects the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w=","/> and any <unk w="emphasis"/> on the <unk w="individual"/> issues or <unk w="the"/> services <unk w="of"/> the ACP States ' wishes , which promotes regional integration , which calls for <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="measures"/> to bring the ACP States ' economies up to standard , and which <unk w="takes"/> account of <unk w="the"/> specific characteristics and fragilities of these countries , be they least developed countries or otherwise .
These are the <unk w="issues"/> that <unk w="would"/> make <unk w="it"/> <unk w="an"/> acceptable <unk w="to"/> .
- The next <unk w="step"/> is a short <unk w="proportion"/> of the report by <unk w="mr"/> Hegyi , on behalf of the Committee <unk w="on"/> the <unk w="environment"/> , Public Health <unk w="and"/> Food Safety , on wilderness in Europe .
<unk w="only"/> <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> % <unk w="of"/> the world 's land mass <unk w="must"/> be considered a natural environment , a wilderness untouched by human <unk w="beings"/> .
In <unk w="fact"/> , however , wilderness makes up only 1 % of the entire territory .
We <unk w="must"/> do everything we can to ensure <unk w="that"/> <unk w="at"/> least the <unk w="european"/> wilderness , this 1 % , is preserved for the sake of future generations .
This is <unk w="the"/> aim <unk w="of"/> my report , and I <unk w="believe"/> that increased protection of wilderness zones will sooner or later be <unk w="translated"/> into EU legislation .
On the one hand , it is viewed as a place to <unk w="come"/> and avoid , <unk w="the"/> monsters and unknown dangers <unk w="and"/> in wait for <unk w="years"/> , as is evoked in many folk tales .
On the other hand , it is <unk w="just"/> as an attractive , pleasant place <unk w="which"/> gives us temporary refuge from the stress of urban and industrial <unk w="activity"/> .
English-language literature on <unk w="this"/> <unk w="occasion"/> makes a <unk w="distinction"/> between the <unk w="rules"/> of conservation , that is , the proper <unk w="combination"/> of nature , and of preservation , <unk w="and"/> other <unk w=","/> the protection <unk w="and"/> nature <unk w="and"/> all <unk w="the"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
These philosophical debates lie beyond the scope of my report , but for the record I would like to <unk w="point"/> out <unk w="that"/> I consider sustainable <unk w="development"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="directive"/> .
<unk w="the"/> wilderness cannot be locked up in a bank safety deposit box , like a necklace or a package of <unk w="technical"/> <unk w="measures"/> .
Thus we must protect nature , but by <unk w="terms"/> of human use .
The <unk w="council"/> of Europe is too small to <unk w="prevent"/> zones that are off-limits <unk w="by"/> its citizens .
Discovering nature and encountering <unk w="are"/> experienced by humanity before <unk w="the"/> teaches respect for nature and can serve as the basis for <unk w="european"/> tourism .
<unk w="at"/> the same time , these areas are extremely vulnerable to <unk w="the"/> changes caused <unk w="by"/> human beings - <unk w="for"/> instance as a result of motorisation , chemicals and climate <unk w="change"/> - and to the appearance of alien plant <unk w="for"/> animal species .
We need to be careful that <unk w="we"/> do not endanger <unk w="the"/> wilderness , and <unk w="combating"/> all forms of tourism should <unk w="be"/> placed under the oversight of conservation <unk w="measures"/> .
The development <unk w="of"/> <unk w="and"/> tourism should <unk w="be"/> combined with the protection of <unk w="all"/> areas , and all proceeds should be devoted <unk w="to"/> <unk w="environmental"/> protection .
The wilderness is a refuge <unk w="in"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="country"/> , <unk w="such"/> as the brown <unk w="report"/> , the <unk w="rapporteur"/> <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="commission"/> , which are <unk w="going"/> to <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> even slightly altered conditions .
There are still many species in Europe <unk w="who"/> are <unk w="going"/> to be <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and described .
Most of these live <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="crisis"/> or in rotting <unk w="areas"/> and are highly sensitive to <unk w="this"/> .
These undisturbed <unk w="we"/> are <unk w="open"/> to the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="terrorism"/> , of natural changes occurring <unk w="in"/> nature .
<unk w="these"/> zones are generally part of the Natura 2000 <unk w="network"/> , but <unk w="also"/> require stricter protection .
My <unk w="group"/> therefore calls <unk w="upon"/> the <unk w="european"/> Commission to work with the Member States to map <unk w="the"/> remaining wilderness regions in <unk w="europe"/> and <unk w="as"/> a <unk w="condition"/> for <unk w="their"/> increased protection .
The natural values <unk w="of"/> the still-untouched areas and the characteristics of the habitats should be determined , and their further protection should <unk w="be"/> ensured .
<unk w="you"/> have advised me <unk w="that"/> we should not think <unk w="in"/> terms of new legislation , <unk w="and"/> <unk w="will"/> introduce more specific and stricter protection for wilderness zones within <unk w="the"/> Natura 2000 regulations .
Since the financing of Natura 2000 is <unk w="in"/> any <unk w="more"/> contradictory , and the source <unk w="of"/> much legitimate criticism , we will in any case <unk w="have"/> to make changes to the relevant regulations in the next parliamentary <unk w="term"/> but at <unk w="the"/> latest <unk w="of"/> the new budget .
This could also be a good opportunity <unk w="for"/> the legal definition and enhanced <unk w="cooperation"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="""/> .
An area of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="basque"/> country , <unk w="the"/> dripstone cave of Aggtelek , is also classified as wilderness .
A part of this site <unk w="is"/> located within the territory of <unk w="the"/> Slovakia .
I would be very happy <unk w="that"/> Hungarian and <unk w="the"/> conservationists <unk w="and"/> successfully collaborate to develop a Protected Area <unk w="agency"/> ( PAN ) <unk w="]"/> , <unk w="in"/> the network of PAN Parks has developed a successful European-wide system of <unk w="european"/> <unk w="materials"/> .
Member of the <unk w="commission"/> . - Mr President , halting the loss of biodiversity is a priority for the Union and for the <unk w="future"/> .
It is quite literally a question <unk w="of"/> the future of life on Earth .
But , despite the fundamental importance of preserving biodiversity , progress to <unk w="what"/> has been limited .
<unk w="in"/> December <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> , the Commission adopted the first comprehensive <unk w="report"/> <unk w="of"/> progress <unk w=","/> <unk w="by"/> both European Community and Member State levels .
Despite <unk w="these"/> positive developments <unk w="that"/> have been made in recent years - for instance the Natura <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> network - the EU <unk w="'s"/> biodiversity <unk w="is"/> still <unk w="under"/> continuous pressure due to habitat <unk w="and"/> , pollution , <unk w="and"/> change <unk w="and"/> the impact <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="environment"/> .
The Commission 's <unk w="proposal"/> <unk w="is"/> that <unk w="they"/> are highly unlikely to <unk w="achieve"/> our 2010 target of halting biodiversity decline - and that further <unk w="research"/> efforts will <unk w="be"/> <unk w="made"/> , both at Member State and EU levels .
Against this background , the Commission welcomes <unk w="the"/> consistent support that Parliament has <unk w="made"/> to efforts <unk w="to"/> protect Europe 's rich and varied <unk w="cultural"/> heritage .
We greatly welcome the initiative of <unk w="the"/> Hegyi for producing this important <unk w="debate"/> on <unk w="copyright"/> in Europe .
I would <unk w="like"/> to start by making <unk w="a"/> general observation that many of the issues highlighted in <unk w="the"/> report are already being <unk w="drawn"/> up by the <unk w="commission"/> .
For <unk w="example"/> , <unk w="in"/> December <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> , the Commission adopted a communication , ' Towards <unk w="the"/> EU Strategy on Invasive Species ' .
We are also launching an <unk w="additional"/> reflection on <unk w="the"/> future of EU biodiversity <unk w=","/> and <unk w="looking"/> forward to the input <unk w="of"/> the European Parliament on these questions .
Issues such as improving implementation <unk w="of"/> the relationship between <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> climate change must be <unk w="carefully"/> considered .
<unk w="it"/> is <unk w="why"/> <unk w="me"/> <unk w="to"/> add one clarification to the report .
There is an ongoing assessment of the effectiveness <unk w="of"/> <unk w="in"/> nature legislation - the so-called Article 17 <unk w="treaty"/> - but there <unk w="is"/> currently no <unk w="need"/> to amend our legislation , <unk w="because"/> the <unk w="main"/> focus <unk w="is"/> on <unk w="their"/> effective implementation .
Turning to the subject <unk w="of"/> wilderness , Europe is densely <unk w="populated"/> and only 1-2 % of the territory has not been affected <unk w="by"/> human intervention .
But while these wilderness areas are <unk w="not"/> in area , they <unk w="are"/> of high value in <unk w="the"/> scientific and cultural terms .
They can even , as is the case <unk w="in"/> the common trans-border National Park <unk w=","/> the German Bavarian and Czech Bohemian forests , be a symbol <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="trade"/> and integration .
Most of these <unk w="countries"/> are already a part of the Natura 2000 network .
<unk w="however"/> , this report provides the inspiration to look again <unk w="at"/> the wild and nearly wild <unk w="birds"/> in the EU <unk w="wanted"/> to see if <unk w="they"/> are <unk w=","/> where additional <unk w="such"/> actions <unk w="can"/> help protect these special places .
<unk w="the"/> Commission has commissioned a number of studies <unk w="which"/> is cooperating <unk w="with"/> the <unk w="current"/> EU Presidency .
A conference will take place in <unk w="nice"/> in May 2009 .
This Conference will offer a <unk w="view"/> to <unk w="all"/> the issues related <unk w="to"/> wilderness areas in Europe and identify measures needed to ensure their <unk w="safety"/> .
Let me conclude <unk w="by"/> confirming that <unk w="the"/> Commission <unk w="believes"/> that Europe 's <unk w="ministry"/> is the result of a long <unk w="period"/> of human intervention .
The concept of a living <unk w="is"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="is"/> the <unk w="pretext"/> of nature <unk w="and"/> <unk w="the"/> needs of man is the basis of <unk w="the"/> thinking <unk w="that"/> underpins <unk w="article"/> 2000 .
We certainly do not intend to re-convert our existing landscapes into wild <unk w="stocks"/> , but we need <unk w="to"/> publicly commit ourselves to preserving the <unk w="few"/> remaining wild areas of Europe .
<unk w="for"/> this reason , the Commission considers the European Parliament resolution timely .
It represents a <unk w="very"/> <unk w="of"/> input into the Prague conference .
Mr President , <unk w="on"/> a point of order , I would like to protest at <unk w="the"/> overuse and the increasingly liberal <unk w="party"/> of Rule 45 ( 2 ) under which <unk w="the"/> most important debates are taken .
I rise <unk w="to"/> <unk w="this"/> point because I <unk w="would"/> would have liked to have spoken on the excellent work <unk w="of"/> Mr Hegyi 's report <unk w="and"/> indeed I have colleagues coming on on subjects which are not <unk w="unanimous"/> in my main committee and <unk w="our"/> colleagues ' main committees , and I am being denied the <unk w="opportunity"/> to contribute toward them in plenary .
In the PPE-DE Group we had a very <unk w="positive"/> and heated <unk w="debate"/> both <unk w="the"/> <unk w="socialist"/> group and group level <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> on the number of Rule <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> ( 2 ) items on our <unk w="agenda"/> <unk w="last"/> week .
I really <unk w="cannot"/> feel we need to urgently revisit this rule .
I know it is a rule that was set by Parliament and the Members themselves signed off on , but our good will , I <unk w="believe"/> , <unk w="be"/> being abused by the number of points <unk w="on"/> our agenda - <unk w="the"/> most important points <unk w="in"/> our agenda - that we are being <unk w="in"/> <unk w="in"/> <unk w="this"/> debate .
- Mrs Doyle , <unk w="i"/> will <unk w="therefore"/> gladly take note of your statement , but I would remind <unk w="you"/> that the use of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="waste"/> is in the hands of <unk w="the"/> Conference of Presidents and that , within the <unk w="council"/> , votes are weighted , that <unk w="is"/> to <unk w="the"/> <unk w="by"/> <unk w="of"/> large groups , and <unk w="my"/> own in particular , have a huge amount of power to decide on <unk w="what"/> <unk w="to"/> be allowed <unk w="in"/> plenary under such-and-such a rule .
I am a bit <unk w="more"/> <unk w="shame"/> ; I <unk w="would"/> say that we <unk w="have"/> perhaps gone from a <unk w="matter"/> of being too tolerant to one of being too strict and that <unk w="the"/> truth is <unk w="not"/> <unk w="war"/> in between .
Do not worry , <unk w="however"/> , we will have those concerned <unk w="about"/> up this matter .
You should also refer to <unk w="the"/> group chairmen , ladies <unk w="and"/> gentlemen .
I think that it is in this context <unk w="that"/> your <unk w="comments"/> will <unk w="be"/> understood <unk w="correctly"/> .
in writing . I was shadow rapporteur on this report on ' <unk w="the"/> <unk w="'"/> <unk w="presidency"/> ' and I would like to congratulate <unk w="my"/> colleague , <unk w="mr"/> Gyula Hegyi , on his <unk w="report"/> .
First of all , we <unk w="also"/> need to <unk w="ensure"/> <unk w="on"/> the mapping <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> last wilderness areas in Europe .
Of course , this <unk w="cannot"/> be done <unk w="by"/> defining ' <unk w="s"/> ' , therefore I urge <unk w="the"/> European Commission to <unk w="take"/> action <unk w="in"/> this field .
Secondly , I <unk w="wish"/> <unk w="to"/> speak on the key issue of <unk w="this"/> report , namely human presence and tourism .
Human presence should not be excluded ; on the contrary , people have to be <unk w="able"/> to <unk w="the"/> natural beauties of their country in order to preserve them better .
<unk w="we"/> need to <unk w="promote"/> sustainable tourism in these areas <unk w="to"/> teach the site managers how <unk w="to"/> preserve and <unk w="consolidate"/> the wilderness .
Therefore I <unk w="welcome"/> the request of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> NGOs in the field and ask the European Commission to give some guidelines for <unk w="its"/> preservation in Europe .
in writing . - Wilderness can mean <unk w="more"/> things to different people .
I personally perceive wilderness as areas <unk w="affected"/> by human <unk w="rights"/> , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="decision-making"/> processes are dominant .
<unk w="but"/> for me , promoting wilderness tourism is a mere contradiction of the term ' wilderness ' .
On the other <unk w="hand"/> , I <unk w="think"/> <unk w="a"/> sustainable tourism , if done properly , can provide an economic <unk w="base"/> for local communities <unk w="to"/> conserve the natural and <unk w="natural"/> heritage .
But the increase in demand for wilderness <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> on <unk w="the"/> very same values that <unk w="young"/> tourists are <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and can speed up the <unk w="process"/> of fragile ecosystems .
A <unk w="solution"/> would be to open a limited part <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> areas to high-quality <unk w="public"/> <unk w="protection"/> , <unk w="which"/> does not adversely affect <unk w="the"/> conservation objectives <unk w="of"/> the sites .
<unk w="such"/> activities should be allowed <unk w="under"/> strict conditions , such as a <unk w="large"/> number of tourists <unk w="one"/> day , and on the basis of a solid sustainable tourism plan that supports conservation initiatives and promotes a responsible experience <unk w="and"/> wilderness .
The tourism plans and the activities of the operators should be <unk w="promoted"/> by means of thorough assessment mechanisms , especially designed for wilderness areas .
The <unk w="commission"/> <unk w="is"/> to make tourists and operators aware that wilderness entails not only freedom but <unk w="take"/> responsibility .
In this respect , <unk w="it"/> is one of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="countries"/> which <unk w="is"/> a significant amount <unk w="of"/> variety <unk w="of"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> fauna .
To achieve this <unk w="objective"/> , however , <unk w="the"/> Europe Union must extend <unk w="the"/> <unk w="use"/> of Community funds earmarked for <unk w="research"/> wilderness conservation activities .
<unk w="however"/> , <unk w="the"/> Commission <unk w="should"/> allocate larger <unk w="resources"/> through the Fund for Rural Development to environmental protection <unk w=","/> in the European agricultural sector , with a clear aim of financing wilderness conservation activities .
<unk w="on"/> the other <unk w="hand"/> , the European <unk w="union"/> should introduce a set <unk w="of"/> clear rules for providing financial <unk w="support"/> <unk w="to"/> local community projects in the vicinity of these <unk w="agreements"/> , which allow controlled <unk w="zones"/> <unk w=","/> tourism in <unk w="those"/> areas intended for conservation and generate economic benefits which can be enjoyed by <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> local <unk w="communities"/> .
In addition , the <unk w="need"/> <unk w="to"/> encourage cross-border cooperation between Member States for conservation projects targeting wilderness areas situated in the <unk w="middle"/> of two or <unk w="third"/> countries .
Europe <unk w="'s"/> biodiversity is the <unk w="most"/> precious <unk w="in"/> which we can leave <unk w="future"/> generations .
I welcome and <unk w="support"/> this report <unk w="on"/> Europe 's wilderness areas .
I would like to draw <unk w="attention"/> to the <unk w="member"/> state of the area with the richest biodiversity in Europe , the Danube Delta .
<unk w="the"/> Delta is being constantly subjected <unk w="to"/> <unk w="acts"/> of aggression <unk w=","/> poaching , illegal economic <unk w="growth"/> and , last but not least , <unk w="on"/> tourism .
One of the <unk w="main"/> sources of aggression affecting the Delta is rooted in the <unk w="lack"/> of awareness of the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> <unk w="of"/> populations and of rural <unk w="populations"/> living along the Danube 's tributaries flowing through <unk w="it"/> .
I would like to take this opportunity to call on the <unk w="commission"/> and the <unk w="commission"/> , <unk w="and"/> on <unk w="this"/> report , to consider as soon as possible <unk w=","/> measures aimed at : setting up a working party to examine the situation <unk w="in"/> the <unk w="palestinian"/> Delta , devising effective <unk w="cooperation"/> programmes about the <unk w="measures"/> targeted at the populations with a direct <unk w="attack"/> on the area 's biodiversity , and establishing biodiversity protection standards .
At the same time , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="we"/> in the <unk w="european"/> Union , especially in the Danube Delta area , <unk w="cannot"/> be <unk w="done"/> without <unk w="a"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> in the countries neighbouring the EU .
Therefore , I <unk w="welcome"/> the <unk w="commission"/> and the Council to step up their dialogue and the implementation <unk w="of"/> specific <unk w="measures"/> <unk w="forms"/> part of <unk w="our"/> relations with these countries .
Bearing in mind that <unk w="it"/> will not be possible to meet <unk w="the"/> commitments made in 2007 by adopting the resolution <unk w="and"/> halting the loss of biodiversity <unk w="in"/> 2010 , the protection <unk w="of"/> wilderness areas through promotion , <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="research"/> activities is becoming a priority in the light of climate change and the <unk w="environmental"/> impact of tourism .
The proposal to <unk w="create"/> a system for <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> wilderness would help <unk w="protect"/> biodiversity and unspoilt areas which will require more attention and a significant effort on the part of <unk w="member"/> States in order to protect them .
Information campaigns aimed at raising <unk w="the"/> general <unk w="public"/> 's awareness of wilderness areas , the implementation of high-quality sustainable tourism and the <unk w="protection"/> of the Birds and Habitats Directives are just some of the instruments <unk w="which"/> will help <unk w="to"/> <unk w="in"/> these areas .
<unk w="we"/> are <unk w="examining"/> eight national parks in Europe , including Retezat National Park in Romania .
These <unk w="amendments"/> are part <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> Protected <unk w="european"/> Network ( <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> ) .
This <unk w="directive"/> is responsible for administering <unk w="many"/> areas <unk w="and"/> brings together all the national authorities and local tourism agencies involved <unk w="in"/> ensuring the <unk w="sustainable"/> development of <unk w="sport"/> .
The European Commission should <unk w="take"/> <unk w="the"/> initiative <unk w="to"/> <unk w=","/> with this network with a view <unk w="to"/> exchanging information and good practice .
- The next item <unk w="is"/> a short presentation of the report by Mr <unk w="miranda"/> , on <unk w="behalf"/> of <unk w="the"/> Committee <unk w="on"/> Transport and <unk w="tourism"/> , on an agenda for sustainable <unk w="development"/> in general and <unk w="in"/> aviation .
Mr President , Commissioner , until now the general and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="fisheries"/> sector has not been addressed specifically at European level .
<unk w="the"/> political significance of <unk w="this"/> report therefore derives from the fact that this is <unk w="the"/> first time <unk w=","/> the <unk w="commission"/> <unk w="and"/> Parliament have <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> this activity , at a time when <unk w="it"/> is recording <unk w="for"/> growth both in volume <unk w="and"/> in economic <unk w="terms"/> .
The numbers speak for themselves : <unk w="""/> business aviation alone , small and medium-sized <unk w="enterprises"/> working in this field <unk w=","/> multiplying , <unk w="the"/> number of aircraft <unk w="are"/> <unk w="up"/> to double to 3 500 in the next <unk w="of"/> <unk w="s"/> annual turnover <unk w="relating"/> to more than EUR <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> <unk w="million"/> .
Directly or <unk w="indirectly"/> , it <unk w="is"/> 154 000 <unk w="people"/> across Europe .
Together with general <unk w="interest"/> , where it is <unk w="possible"/> <unk w=","/> there <unk w=","/> between 30 000 and <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> 000 aircraft , the sector represents around 9 % <unk w="of"/> all recorded air traffic and boasts the fastest growth <unk w="of"/> Europe , twice as high as that <unk w="of"/> all <unk w="the"/> <unk w="possible"/> .
The <unk w="principal"/> <unk w="of"/> segment offers important social and economic <unk w="development"/> : by providing flexible point-to-point transportation it increases citizens ' mobility , companies ' productivity and regional cohesion .
<unk w="the"/> general aviation <unk w="policy"/> provides <unk w="public"/> services in very diverse areas , from <unk w="european"/> aviation to firefighting , traffic regulation , cartography and leisure and sports <unk w="federations"/> .
It <unk w="is"/> also an <unk w="important"/> source <unk w="of"/> professional skills for the entire <unk w="european"/> <unk w="sector"/> .
I must also mention European industry in this sector , <unk w="which"/> has been showing continuous growth in <unk w="the"/> world <unk w="market"/> share , which currently hovers around 16 % <unk w=","/> which it is therefore necessary <unk w="to"/> support .
Looking at the report itself , I agree , <unk w="as"/> rapporteur , with the need <unk w="to"/> <unk w="by"/> the Commission in its <unk w="report"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="special"/> needs of <unk w="the"/> sector and identify its <unk w="own"/> themes .
The <unk w="commission"/> <unk w="relating"/> to data collection and are based on the <unk w="possibility"/> of providing political decision-makers with <unk w="the"/> data <unk w="and"/> statistical <unk w="data"/> to give them a better understanding of the sector so that they can regulate it adequately .
The second point relates to the <unk w="application"/> of the principle of proportionality <unk w="and"/> regulating the sector .
The key <unk w="issue"/> is <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> rules designed to govern the operation of commercial aircraft will be adequate for operating simpler and smaller , often single-engine aircraft .
We support the Commission in its intention to apply the principle <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="of"/> drafting the rules and in their implementation , always bearing in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> necessity of not compromising <unk w="them"/> in general .
This is the case , for <unk w="example"/> , with <unk w="the"/> <unk w="withdrawal"/> of certain airworthiness rules , already <unk w="caused"/> by the European Aviation Safety Agency ( EASA ) , to operations <unk w="in"/> non-commercial aircraft , <unk w="and"/> the possible application of specific <unk w="measures"/> with regard to simplified security <unk w="and"/> <unk w="the"/> screening <unk w="and"/> <unk w="a"/> business <unk w="equipment"/> .
The third <unk w="point"/> concerns the problem of access <unk w="to"/> airports and airspace .
The diagnosis has been made : these aircraft <unk w="are"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="place"/> in accessing large <unk w="companies"/> <unk w=","/> are starting to <unk w="put"/> the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="and"/> in regional <unk w="and"/> secondary <unk w="interest"/> .
The solutions <unk w="resulting"/> from <unk w="on"/> the use of existing capacity to perhaps <unk w="improve"/> the regulations <unk w="on"/> slots .
It is also necessary to stimulate investment in small and medium-sized airports to provide increasing interconnections <unk w="in"/> the different European regions and <unk w="countries"/> .
As regards <unk w="the"/> question of <unk w="production"/> capacity , <unk w="we"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> importance of <unk w="research"/> within <unk w="the"/> framework of the Single European Sky and the SESAR ( Single European Sky ATM <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> ) Joint <unk w="action"/> and , once <unk w="again"/> , we come back <unk w="to"/> the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> not <unk w="to"/> <unk w="to"/> disproportionate demands on <unk w="the"/> <unk w="professionals"/> in terms of navigation equipment , while <unk w="not"/> complying with <unk w="emission"/> limits .
<unk w="the"/> fourth and <unk w="fourth"/> point refers to the environmental sustainability of this area <unk w="of"/> activity .
<unk w="in"/> the CO2 <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> small aircraft are lower , <unk w="it"/> is still necessary <unk w="to"/> promote research , development and innovation , not <unk w="only"/> within the framework of the Clean Sky and CESAR ( Cost <unk w="of"/> <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> Aircraft ) <unk w="""/> , but also in <unk w="the"/> use of <unk w="the"/> polluting engines <unk w="for"/> cleaner fuels .
I would like to end , <unk w="madam"/> President and <unk w="gentlemen"/> , by expressing the hope that <unk w="this"/> report represents a real framework for future legislative and regulatory measures which may be <unk w="set"/> up for <unk w="the"/> sector .
That is the wish of the Committee on Transport and Tourism when it calls on the <unk w="commission"/> <unk w="to"/> report <unk w="on"/> the <unk w="end"/> of 2009 on the progress achieved on <unk w="the"/> issues raised in the report .
With tomorrow 's vote , my expectation <unk w="is"/> that this wish will be shared <unk w="by"/> a large majority of the Members of this House .
Member of <unk w="the"/> Commission . - Mr President , the Commission <unk w="'"/> <unk w="s"/> report <unk w="on"/> <unk w="both"/> the <unk w="commission"/> and the <unk w="commission"/> for their excellent work .
In January 2008 <unk w="the"/> Commission for the first <unk w="time"/> published a communication on <unk w="copyright"/> and business <unk w="equipment"/> .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w="we"/> followed <unk w="by"/> a very positive Council conclusion in <unk w="agenda"/> 2008 , and now by <unk w="the"/> important report of Parliament .
General and business <unk w="sustainability"/> is an important sector of <unk w="the"/> EU <unk w="fisheries"/> industry , worth about EUR 2.3 billion annually .
It <unk w="is"/> substantially in <unk w="research"/> and development , and <unk w="the"/> growing <unk w="importance"/> .
Over two <unk w="years"/> of <unk w="the"/> aircraft certified in the EU are in <unk w="this"/> sector .
General and business aviation mainly <unk w="concern"/> small and medium-sized enterprises .
<unk w="these"/> regulations need to be adapted <unk w="to"/> this specific nature , without , <unk w="either"/> , compromising safety or security .
<unk w="we"/> are happy to <unk w="remember"/> that this notion of <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> is encouraged by Parliament in <unk w="this"/> report .
There are <unk w="two"/> main areas on which we will have to focus our efforts in the nearest future : development of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="minimum"/> standards for general aviation ; integration of non-commercial aviation into the next generation of air traffic <unk w="control"/> ( ATM ) systems for Europe ; and reducing the negative environmental footprint of the sector .
The Commission intends in <unk w="the"/> coming year <unk w="and"/> <unk w="in"/> a number <unk w="of"/> EU implementing rules ensuring a uniform level of <unk w="safety"/> of <unk w="european"/> aviation .
<unk w="you"/> highlighted in your report , we have to make sure that <unk w="we"/> are <unk w="not"/> only <unk w="at"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="an"/> adequate level of safety , but are also proportionate and do not impose <unk w="the"/> burden <unk w="on"/> operators .
We will also <unk w="support"/> the development <unk w="of"/> the future ATM system for Europe with a clear <unk w="view"/> that airspace is a common good <unk w="market"/> <unk w="must"/> be accessible for all its users in a <unk w="european"/> <unk w="way"/> .
From the <unk w="area"/> of general aviation , the Single European Sky and SESAR <unk w="will"/> be of the utmost importance for <unk w="this"/> , <unk w="in"/> a <unk w="long"/> way , access to airspace <unk w="and"/> aerodromes .
These technologies will open the <unk w="way"/> to new services , as yet unseen in <unk w="practice"/> .
Last but not least , general and business aviation , <unk w="with"/> <unk w="and"/> ongoing technological advances , <unk w="but"/> also <unk w="impact"/> on the environment and , like <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> airline industry , they need to contribute to reducing these impacts .
<unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> as well , <unk w="it"/> will be an important principle to follow .
The Commission is <unk w="looking"/> forward <unk w="in"/> working with Parliament along <unk w="the"/> lines of the <unk w="debate"/> , and will report back on the progress made .
<unk w="from"/> the outset I would like to thank <unk w="mr"/> Queiró for his report on a subject so important to the future of transport in Europe .
I would like to emphasise <unk w="the"/> significance of the issue of <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="and"/> business <unk w=","/> and the aircraft manufacturing industry <unk w="in"/> this sector .
Although the <unk w="measures"/> proposed by the Commission do <unk w="not"/> bring any radical legislative changes and <unk w="would"/> seem of <unk w="social"/> significance <unk w="and"/> , their influence <unk w="on"/> the future <unk w="of"/> aviation <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="process"/> of deregulation <unk w="in"/> the market and development of the air carriage sector in <unk w="europe"/> cannot <unk w="be"/> <unk w="it"/> .
The Commission 's objective is to facilitate development <unk w="in"/> this <unk w="is"/> <unk w="caused"/> by simplifying existing regulatory procedures , adapting provisions <unk w="for"/> new forms of air <unk w="safety"/> <unk w=","/> and revising <unk w="measures"/> to ensure proportionality .
It is obvious that this <unk w="debate"/> is worthy of full support .
<unk w="however"/> , care <unk w="must"/> be taken that , in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="case"/> of <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> and implementing policy , <unk w="the"/> needs of all categories of users of airspace and aviation infrastructure are <unk w="under"/> consideration in the planning and optimisation of capacity .
<unk w="in"/> order <unk w="to"/> facilitate further reform a basic European data collection system should , however , be <unk w="used"/> for general and business aviation .
Ultimately it will also <unk w="be"/> necessary <unk w="to"/> facilitate the access of this <unk w="criterion"/> to foreign markets , supporting the development of new , competitive technologies , <unk w="and"/> at the same time taking care <unk w=","/> respect is maintained for the principles of natural environment protection .
in writing . - I <unk w="think"/> this <unk w=":"/> for it seeks to <unk w="help"/> <unk w="to"/> bring more clarity to the rules on General and Business <unk w="transactions"/> on a community level .
This <unk w="is"/> the fastest growing segment of civil aviation <unk w="is"/> <unk w=","/> and it provides numerous social and economic benefits to <unk w="member"/> States .
However , to make <unk w="the"/> most of <unk w="this"/> , we need to <unk w="review"/> the proper regulation .
For example , currently there is a lack <unk w="of"/> reliable data <unk w="on"/> this sector and this deficiency must <unk w="be"/> quickly addressed for management , <unk w="training"/> and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="measures"/> .
The Commission should <unk w="make"/> a <unk w="clear"/> distinction between large-scale commercial aircraft operations and <unk w="are"/> owned airplanes .
The legislation <unk w="must"/> be proportional <unk w="to"/> the risks incurred by <unk w="the"/> different <unk w="types"/> of aviation and mindful in terms <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> cost burden it places <unk w="for"/> them .
The <unk w="european"/> <unk w="union"/> should <unk w="be"/> stimulating and enhancing the industry <unk w="instead"/> of limiting it .
A cause for concern <unk w="may"/> be that most of the General and Business Aviation falls outside of the <unk w="scope"/> of the Commission Directive to include <unk w="such"/> activities in the <unk w="sector"/> <unk w="of"/> greenhouse gas <unk w="and"/> allowance <unk w="""/> .
Considering the fast growth rate of the sector , I think there is a need to offset its environmental impact <unk w="on"/> one form or another .
in writing . - ( PL ) At a <unk w="time"/> when <unk w="we"/> keep hearing the word ' <unk w="citizenship"/> ' , it is not easy to talk <unk w="about"/> the stable future of general and business aviation .
I therefore thank Luís <unk w="warmly"/> for taking the trouble to prepare the report on <unk w="this"/> subject .
Congratulations . I <unk w="am"/> certain <unk w="that"/> it is air transport which can be a driving force , setting the world and European <unk w="economy"/> in <unk w="colombia"/> .
We remember <unk w="that"/> barely 106 years ago the Wright brothers made the world 's first powered , controlled flight ( <unk w="but"/> it was for barely 40 metres ) in an aircraft .
Today <unk w="we"/> <unk w="be"/> a highly-developed industry , making ' flying machines ' <unk w=","/> are <unk w="to"/> <unk w="not"/> equipped with <unk w="the"/> <unk w="number"/> of instruments .
Aviation also includes <unk w="a"/> whole complicated field of <unk w="energy"/> and flight control , building a ground-based airport <unk w="management"/> , a system of security , and so on .
We <unk w="must"/> be aware that <unk w="in"/> Europe about 50 000 aircraft are in <unk w="place"/> in general and business aviation , <unk w="but"/> almost four times as many small <unk w="companies"/> and <unk w="which"/> are used for sport and recreation .
In this context , ensuring proper capacity for the European airspace and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="beings"/> themselves is an <unk w="extremely"/> important issue .
I would like here <unk w="to"/> draw attention to <unk w="the"/> significance of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="policy"/> <unk w="and"/> ensuring <unk w="freedom"/> of communication in <unk w="the"/> EU .
Naturally , when speaking of the development of air <unk w="transport"/> , <unk w="we"/> must not forget problems related to the natural environment .
Mr President , the debate on the aviation industry is <unk w="being"/> distorted : there is a <unk w="much-needed"/> focus <unk w="on"/> the problems of emissions from air traffic but people <unk w="are"/> not prepared <unk w="to"/> see its potential .
Obviously , aviation and air traffic cause emissions , <unk w="and"/> it is just as obvious that they represent the future .
This is true of commercial air transport <unk w=","/> <unk w="in"/> <unk w="in"/> general aviation .
Although EU internal market legislation has mainly addressed <unk w="to"/> air transport , it is <unk w="worth"/> noting <unk w="that"/> <unk w="need"/> to do with general and business aviation are <unk w="not"/> <unk w="to"/> crop up <unk w="to"/> <unk w="much"/> more in areas such as climate policy , protection of the environment and aviation <unk w="industry"/> .
<unk w="if"/> we take <unk w="into"/> account <unk w="the"/> growing importance of business aviation in particular , <unk w="will"/> definitely need to <unk w="draw"/> attention <unk w="to"/> these sectors and guarantee <unk w="their"/> competitiveness .
I wish to express a concern I have with regard to <unk w="the"/> conditions for <unk w="enlargement"/> .
Small and <unk w="medium-sized"/> airports <unk w="are"/> crucial for both general and business aviation . Their <unk w="growth"/> and modernisation should <unk w="be"/> promoted <unk w="by"/> Member <unk w="states"/> <unk w="must"/> <unk w="to"/> invest .
The <unk w="main"/> <unk w=","/> in <unk w="european"/> aviation , however , is clogging up the airports in use <unk w=","/> and more .
This is a <unk w="result"/> of the development potential of air traffic as a <unk w="result"/> .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="to"/> do all it can to encourage <unk w="research"/> into more innovative <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> energy-efficient and environmentally friendly aircraft .
The aim must be nothing less <unk w="than"/> emission-free air traffic .
- <unk w="the"/> next item is a short presentation of the report <unk w="by"/> Mrs Záborská , on behalf of the Committee on Women <unk w="'"/> Rights and Gender Equality , on <unk w="democracy"/> based on gender and inter-generational <unk w="rights"/> .
May I first of <unk w="all"/> sincerely thank all fellow Members for their help with my own-initiative report .
<unk w="by"/> voting in the Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality was the result of much wide-ranging discussion and accommodation .
The men and women who are today involved in establishing inter-generational <unk w="rights"/> <unk w="they"/> deserve recognition .
Their determination is an <unk w="important"/> <unk w="approach"/> to national and <unk w="international"/> wealth and to the common <unk w="position"/> .
This is the reason <unk w="for"/> <unk w="men"/> and women are being exposed to hidden forms of discrimination .
<unk w="mergers"/> and <unk w="we"/> are entitled <unk w="to"/> a <unk w="free"/> choice of suitable and comfortable activities .
The obligation on society is to guarantee this freedom of choice and not <unk w="to"/> <unk w="fight"/> against any activity simply because it does <unk w="not"/> fall within the usual scope of <unk w="the"/> formal <unk w="internal"/> market .
This is a brief summary of my own-initiative report on non-discrimination based <unk w="on"/> gender and <unk w="social"/> solidarity .
The <unk w="purpose"/> of this <unk w="directive"/> is <unk w="at"/> the heart of discussions <unk w="in"/> <unk w="the"/> future of Europe and <unk w="especially"/> in its Member States .
Although it is a rather technical report , it also has a <unk w="european"/> dimension .
There is something in it for <unk w="all"/> of us as each of us lives within networks of broader <unk w="economic"/> narrower <unk w="economic"/> and social relationships , in which we are personally involved .
Restricting <unk w="the"/> <unk w="use"/> of inter-generational <unk w=","/> <unk w="not"/> just childcare is a <unk w="small"/> <unk w="one"/> .
Inter-generational solidarity also involves responsibility with <unk w="it"/> <unk w="of"/> our parents and elders and care for dependents .
Inter-generational solidarity also involves education of <unk w="women"/> with regard to respect for <unk w="democracy"/> , human dignity <unk w="and"/> environmental protection .
It is the basis <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="citizens"/> <unk w="of"/> Europe and the common good <unk w="of"/> its inhabitants .
Human resources managers agree that human capabilities <unk w="are"/> comparable to university <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
It is therefore necessary to assess this value <unk w="of"/> an explicit and positive manner .
The European <unk w="union"/> must <unk w="create"/> a political framework <unk w="in"/> order to achieve this <unk w="objective"/> .
Women are the <unk w="same"/> <unk w="to"/> contribute to inter-generational solidarity , thus participating in the creation of social relations .
<unk w="that"/> is why this <unk w="debate"/> is devoted mainly to <unk w="it"/> .
<unk w="the"/> use mathematical models to highlight the value of housework .
Longstanding research by economists and demographers suggests <unk w="that"/> <unk w="parliament"/> 's contribution to gross domestic product could <unk w="be"/> even <unk w="worse"/> if their unpaid <unk w="or"/> were <unk w="not"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
We must look <unk w="carefully"/> in order to create the conditions for all women and men <unk w="to"/> become <unk w="involved"/> in <unk w="european"/> solidarity regardless of <unk w="their"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
The European Union must act if <unk w="it"/> is <unk w="to"/> <unk w="to"/> non-discrimination and equality of opportunity .
My political group , the Group of <unk w="the"/> European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) <unk w="and"/> European Democrats , <unk w="i"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="financial"/> support for a policy of non-discrimination which pursues the general <unk w="principles"/> and respects the distinct characteristics and complementary nature of men and <unk w="women"/> .
Ladies and <unk w="gentlemen"/> , I should also like <unk w="to"/> point out <unk w="that"/> this report is the result of extensive consultations with numerous women 's non-governmental organisations .
In my <unk w="opinion"/> , I have also taken account of the opinions of three of our <unk w="committee"/> 's Intergroups : ATD Quart Monde , the Intergroup on Family and <unk w="freedom"/> of <unk w="parliament"/> and the Intergroup on <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
The <unk w="debate"/> on <unk w="women"/> <unk w="'s"/> Rights and Gender Equality <unk w=","/> <unk w="in"/> this report unanimously .
Ladies and gentlemen , I should like to invite <unk w="members"/> to allow us to continue with this cooperation and to vote tomorrow for the FEMM Committee <unk w="'"/> motion for a <unk w="resolution"/> .
Member of <unk w="the"/> Commission . - <unk w="mr"/> President , I think <unk w="that"/> <unk w="commission"/> 's <unk w="view"/> is very important because the subject she is <unk w="saying"/> is <unk w="that"/> <unk w="it"/> is <unk w="of"/> the utmost importance <unk w="for"/> our society .
The <unk w="level"/> of dependence will become more <unk w="and"/> more important <unk w="in"/> the future because of demographic ageing , but also because of <unk w="equality"/> between men and women as <unk w="a"/> care <unk w="for"/> children and <unk w="who"/> is <unk w="being"/> carried out mostly by women .
Therefore , we have to put <unk w="into"/> practice measures that help women enter <unk w="to"/> stay in the labour market by improving family life conditions , especially those <unk w="which"/> facilitate a balance between professional and <unk w="private"/> life .
As specifically concerns the situation regarding the care <unk w="of"/> dependants , the Commission <unk w="has"/> already put the following actions on the table .
<unk w="we"/> leave <unk w="the"/> care <unk w="or"/> dependent family <unk w="content"/> was included in the consultation of the European social <unk w="model"/> on the reconciliation of work , private and family life .
<unk w="the"/> Commission <unk w="is"/> also studying the <unk w="issue"/> of services for elderly <unk w="young"/> people and protection against ill treatment , as well as measures which could <unk w="be"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="at"/> <unk w="european"/> level in cooperation with the Member States to <unk w="ensure"/> <unk w="in"/> the development and modernisation of <unk w="goods"/> and services .
The EU <unk w="competition"/> policy , through <unk w="the"/> European Social Fund , will continue <unk w="to"/> cofinance initiatives at national and local level .
The <unk w="working"/> method of <unk w="coordination"/> <unk w="in"/> the field of <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> and <unk w="the"/> inclusion <unk w="in"/> particular <unk w="reference"/> to <unk w="the"/> modernisation of pension schemes to take <unk w="greater"/> account of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="use"/> of <unk w="which"/> , <unk w="which"/> breaks and long-term care for dependent people .
We are <unk w="working"/> on this , and really look forward <unk w="to"/> collaborating <unk w="working"/> closely with parliamentarians .
We would like to congratulate Parliament on the very <unk w="in-depth"/> work done .
( EL ) Mr President , I should like <unk w="to"/> comment that , in this report <unk w=","/> was adopted with an absolute majority <unk w="in"/> the Committee on Women <unk w="'"/> Rights and Gender <unk w="issues"/> , there is also an <unk w="interesting"/> motion tabled by certain Members .
We shall be called on tomorrow to vote by <unk w="parliament"/> between this motion <unk w="and"/> <unk w="a"/> motion tabled by a parliamentary committee .
We <unk w="are"/> <unk w="talking"/> about <unk w="the"/> <unk w="procedural"/> motion in <unk w="china"/> , nor can we hear the Members who tabled it <unk w=","/> nor can <unk w="we"/> express an opinion <unk w="on"/> it .
It is a defect in the new rules <unk w="and"/> <unk w="we"/> need to <unk w="bear"/> in mind .
- Yes , Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou , what I said <unk w="earlier"/> to Mrs Doyle also applies here .
We are applying Rule 45 which , <unk w="in"/> <unk w="example"/> , provides a very strict framework <unk w="for"/> our speaking <unk w="time"/> , since only the rapporteur can take the <unk w="decision"/> .
We take our lead <unk w="to"/> the Conference of Presidents , which decided <unk w="on"/> this subject came under that particular <unk w="debate"/> .
Our Rules <unk w="and"/> <unk w="only"/> certainly ought to be developed <unk w="and"/> allow <unk w="for"/> greater flexibility <unk w="in"/> richer debates , but , as <unk w="you"/> <unk w="can"/> understand , it is not up to me to amend these Rules of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="this"/> evening .
Discrimination based on gender is still a reality , unfortunately , even in the European Union <unk w="member"/> States .
This fact is not only valid in the <unk w="audiovisual"/> sector , where men account <unk w="are"/> nine-tenths <unk w="of"/> the members <unk w="and"/> boards of directors in large companies , but also in the public sector where women <unk w="are"/> also <unk w="involved"/> .
However , the Lisbon <unk w="strategy"/> aims to ensure that 60 % of <unk w="those"/> able to work are in employment .
<unk w="apart"/> from this , <unk w="we"/> must <unk w="not"/> forget that one of the <unk w="major"/> challenges in Europe in <unk w="the"/> medium- <unk w="and"/> long-term <unk w="and"/> the demographic situation .
The <unk w="european"/> Union <unk w="is"/> facing a bigger <unk w="growth"/> in <unk w="the"/> average age <unk w="of"/> its population than other regions of the <unk w="union"/> , along with a <unk w="strong"/> growth <unk w="of"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> % , <unk w="which"/> means that <unk w="the"/> European Union will need , at the same time , to face up to a fall in the <unk w="eu"/> able to work <unk w="towards"/> an ageing <unk w="population"/> .
<unk w="secondly"/> , the choice between having a career and raising a <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> must not <unk w="be"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> mandatory and it must be possible to balance these two aspects of life .
One <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> European Union 's key values is to eliminate any form of discrimination .
Apart from eliminating discrimination , which <unk w="also"/> means between men and women , we have the responsibility to implement proactive measures to <unk w="improve"/> professional <unk w="and"/> <unk w="for"/> women .
One of the fields in which <unk w="we"/> <unk w="is"/> hugely <unk w="important"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
In <unk w="fact"/> , they are not <unk w="sufficiently"/> underrepresented in numerical terms , but also within the management <unk w="sector"/> : the higher <unk w="incidence"/> <unk w="incidence"/> in the hierarchy , the lower the proportion of women .
In this way , society is <unk w="in"/> itself of the creative potential of an important section of the population .
<unk w="the"/> highly competitive nature of research , <unk w="the"/> inherent geographical mobility <unk w=","/> with scientific work , along with establishing a career at a relatively late age all make <unk w="the"/> activity difficult to combine with family life .
I <unk w="am"/> taking advantage <unk w="of"/> the discussion of this topic <unk w="and"/> highlight the need to introduce specific policies <unk w="which"/> <unk w="for"/> achieving equality between men and women in the academic profession .
These policies must <unk w="come"/> into <unk w="account"/> a set of good <unk w="principles"/> <unk w="at"/> <unk w="european"/> level , such as facilitating dual <unk w="training"/> , encouraging universities and research institutes to invest in childcare <unk w="companies"/> , as well <unk w="as"/> fast-track <unk w=","/> to <unk w="the"/> posts for women .
The Member States of the European Union must <unk w="promote"/> demographic renewal , incorporating their <unk w="rights"/> into <unk w="a"/> renewed <unk w=","/> <unk w=","/> for Growth and <unk w="employment"/> , in line with the policy of equality between men and women .
A balance in European societies depends on <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> total of <unk w="the"/> relations between the <unk w="eu"/> , <unk w="which"/> are <unk w="more"/> complex than <unk w="ever"/> before : <unk w="will"/> people continue to live in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="roads"/> ' home for longer periods , <unk w="and"/> it is increasingly common <unk w="for"/> those <unk w="who"/> <unk w="who"/> have to <unk w="ensure"/> <unk w="on"/> their aging relatives as <unk w="well"/> .
The burden that this <unk w="would"/> rests primarily on the young and middle-aged <unk w="industry"/> , and especially on <unk w="it"/> .
For this reason , equality between women <unk w="and"/> men , that is to say , <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="report"/> , would <unk w="it"/> <unk w="to"/> be a fundamental condition <unk w="for"/> bringing about new forms <unk w="of"/> inter-generational solidarity .
With regard to <unk w="its"/> obligations , that is , the reconciliation of family <unk w="reunification"/> and work , the <unk w="lack"/> of equality between men and women is clearly very <unk w="important"/> if <unk w="their"/> families are to gain new impetus .
It is <unk w="therefore"/> of critical importance to guarantee <unk w="the"/> opportunity for childcare of appropriate <unk w="training"/> and quantity for <unk w="people"/> who would like to take up paid employment alongside <unk w="it"/> .
The Socialist Group <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> European Parliament is doing everything it can to ensure that the goals <unk w="of"/> Barcelona <unk w="agreements"/> are met , <unk w="and"/> notes with disappointment <unk w="that"/> this objective <unk w=","/> visibly absent from the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="""/> .
If Europe <unk w="wishes"/> to change <unk w="the"/> trend towards population reduction , <unk w="which"/> must , through the policy of the <unk w="eu"/> and the Member States , <unk w="as"/> <unk w=","/> in <unk w="a"/> possible <unk w="way"/> , and permit women and men to <unk w="their"/> family life <unk w="and"/> <unk w="children"/> , but such that obligations connected with home and family are equally <unk w="important"/> between men and women .
I wholeheartedly support the alternative motion for a European Parliament resolution on non-discrimination <unk w="based"/> on gender and inter-generational solidarity , which is <unk w="more"/> realistic than the <unk w="synthesis"/> report .
I must particularly emphasise the objective of creating a <unk w="new"/> <unk w="system"/> that is balanced between the genders .
Inequality in <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="of"/> caring is often caused by the absence <unk w="of"/> <unk w="democracy"/> , <unk w="offering"/> <unk w=","/> high-quality services in Member States , and <unk w="we"/> are <unk w="dealing"/> with the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of <unk w="all"/> their opportunities to <unk w="protect"/> <unk w="the"/> social , <unk w="economic"/> and political life .
All of this preserves the inequality in the distribution <unk w="of"/> <unk w="is"/> connected with home <unk w="and"/> family between men and women , which generally forces women <unk w="to"/> choose a more flexible organisation of labour or give up working , which in turn influences their <unk w="homes"/> , the continuing disparity between <unk w="the"/> <unk w="countries"/> earned by women and men , and pension rights .
I am cautious of the recommendation of the Czech Presidency to make <unk w="turkey"/> ' a fully valid alternative to a professional career ' .
I <unk w="am"/> convinced that the <unk w="adoption"/> of this recommendation would perpetuate the traditional division of labour between men <unk w="and"/> women .
The measures <unk w="proposed"/> in the framework of <unk w="the"/> Lisbon Strategy play an important role in establishing equality in the <unk w="field"/> of labour between women and men ; their <unk w="families"/> , in <unk w="addition"/> to increasing <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , promoting <unk w="sustainable"/> and <unk w="social"/> productivity , <unk w="must"/> also be to <unk w="invest"/> in the EU the gender discrimination <unk w="which"/> has <unk w="lost"/> over time .
Ideal <unk w=","/> who spent their youth caring for their children represent today the <unk w="heart"/> of the <unk w="male"/> female population and <unk w="it"/> is <unk w="the"/> childcare and homecare <unk w="it"/> is not <unk w="involved"/> in their pensions .
Many <unk w="of"/> them do not receive an appropriate <unk w="basis"/> for this <unk w="kind"/> <unk w="to"/> work during their active life and this exposes them to a greater risk of poverty .
This <unk w="is"/> <unk w="is"/> a <unk w="situation"/> <unk w="where"/> young women are postponing motherhood and giving <unk w="them"/> to a professional career .
During my many <unk w="comments"/> in the House , I have constantly emphasised that mothers and fathers <unk w="are"/> freely choose to <unk w="take"/> up their children or to <unk w="be"/> for elderly or dependent <unk w="on"/> members <unk w="do"/> not <unk w="suffer"/> discrimination .
I know many families <unk w="who"/> have disabled relatives and carry out this demanding work with great <unk w="interest"/> despite the <unk w="fact"/> <unk w="that"/> <unk w="we"/> have to <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
<unk w="in"/> this speech , I should like to <unk w="highlight"/> the proposals made by the rapporteur Mrs Anna Záborská , <unk w="on"/> <unk w="the"/> recognition <unk w="is"/> only of <unk w="other"/> forms of <unk w="illegal"/> employment but also <unk w="in"/> the manifold forms of non-gainful employment carried <unk w="out"/> in families as part of inter-generational solidarity .
This work is reflected <unk w="in"/> <unk w="the"/> GDP if a family employs someone .
I believe <unk w="that"/> <unk w="this"/> report will inspire Member States to <unk w="ensure"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="to"/> improve family policy within the EU .
<unk w="at"/> a time <unk w="when"/> Europe is facing a deep economic crisis whose final magnitude may be difficult to estimate , it is only to be expected that the birth rate will feel the negative repercussions of the turmoil on <unk w="the"/> labour market , as many women will tend <unk w=","/> to have children because they are terrified of the possibility of losing <unk w="their"/> job and of the reduction in the material resources required to care <unk w=","/> and bring up <unk w="their"/> children .
Against this background , it is the duty of every Member <unk w="state"/> to <unk w="protect"/> multigenerational activities , such as ' bridge-between-generation ' centres , where older adults are <unk w="going"/> to take care of and <unk w="set"/> up children .
<unk w="the"/> ' bridge-between-generation ' centres , which operate successfully in <unk w="the"/> Member States , would allow women <unk w="to"/> have had a child to return <unk w="their"/> work quite soon , while also making it easier for elderly retired people to <unk w="return"/> to employment .
In the last few decades the population in the Member States of the European Union has increasingly <unk w="increased"/> .
Successfully balancing professional and personal life is starting to become a <unk w="priority"/> task <unk w="of"/> women .
It is <unk w="therefore"/> now <unk w="much"/> more important <unk w="than"/> Member <unk w="states"/> to promote the birth rate and to pay proper <unk w="attention"/> to families .
<unk w="in"/> this area the EU could indirectly contribute <unk w="to"/> help Member States to modernise their <unk w="laws"/> .
I <unk w="think"/> that recognition of ' unseen labour ' is one of <unk w="the"/> important <unk w="decisions"/> <unk w="that"/> could be taken in this field .
We also <unk w="cannot"/> ignore the fact that <unk w="the"/> more people of active age are <unk w=","/> after <unk w="pensioners"/> and <unk w="very"/> elderly relatives at the same time , leaving them in a <unk w="common"/> position .
<unk w="that"/> <unk w="is"/> why <unk w="it"/> is particularly <unk w="important"/> for <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> to introduce practical initiatives for <unk w="the"/> official recognition of skills gained <unk w="from"/> activities connected with looking after children and dependent people , <unk w="every"/> household <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , so <unk w="that"/> these <unk w="measures"/> are taken into account when <unk w="regulate"/> the <unk w="internal"/> market .
Today we <unk w="need"/> to think about the future of all these mothers who look after children , who are the future of Europe , and protect <unk w="consumers"/> <unk w="at"/> the risk <unk w="of"/> one day receiving small pensions and being in an unequal position compared with other members of society .
Pre-commercial <unk w="subject"/> : Driving innovation to <unk w="ensure"/> sustainable high quality public <unk w="education"/> in Europe ( short presentation )
- The next item is a short presentation of <unk w="the"/> report by Mr <unk w="miranda"/> , on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , on pre-commercial <unk w="suppliers"/> : driving innovation to ensure <unk w="that"/> <unk w="the"/> quality public services <unk w="in"/> Europe .
rapporteur . - Mr President , it is particularly appropriate that <unk w="commissioner"/> Reding is responding for the Commission <unk w="proposal"/> <unk w="that"/> my report is focused on a proposal <unk w="which"/> has <unk w="been"/> developed over a <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> <unk w="of"/> years with her <unk w="work"/> .
<unk w="this"/> is an extremely important proposal , which has wide-ranging possibilities for the <unk w="competitiveness"/> of the European economy .
<unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> message <unk w="that"/> the <unk w="house"/> tonight is to <unk w="offer"/> <unk w="the"/> services for <unk w="political"/> leadership on this , <unk w="and"/> to say that I think <unk w="this"/> initiative needs to be much better known .
It needs to spread <unk w="more"/> widely from DG <unk w="information"/> Society - as I think it is now starting to do - because it is of such <unk w="importance"/> , particularly in <unk w="the"/> economic times <unk w=","/> are <unk w="increasing"/> at the moment .
It <unk w="is"/> estimated <unk w="that"/> EUR 1 800 billion is spent on public procurement <unk w="every"/> year .
How much of that procurement <unk w="is"/> actually spent on investigating , researching and encouraging <unk w="the"/> development of new solutions to the <unk w="new"/> challenges <unk w="of"/> public authorities and indeed society face <unk w="one"/> day : a better health <unk w="situation"/> , a better transport <unk w="policy"/> , dealing with climate change , more energy efficient buildings ?
EU procurement spending linked <unk w="to"/> <unk w="research"/> and development is less than 1 % of <unk w="the"/> total procurement budget .
Bearing in mind that we have an explicit objective <unk w="in"/> the Lisbon Strategy to move our R & D spending up towards the 3 % target , there is huge potential here .
That is <unk w="why"/> the <unk w="largest"/> mission of <unk w="the"/> <unk w="it"/> comes in .
<unk w="however"/> , what we are <unk w="calling"/> for are intelligent , research-focused public authorities to generate a demand for innovative <unk w="projects"/> and then work with <unk w="the"/> companies <unk w=","/> and <unk w="consumers"/> - but particularly small enterprises who really can benefit from <unk w="it"/> - to fulfil those <unk w="obligations"/> .
We want <unk w="to"/> <unk w="do"/> <unk w="what"/> <unk w="we"/> really think ahead , to be demanding , <unk w="we"/> think about the solutions for which no <unk w="alternative"/> solution yet <unk w="again"/> , but where there <unk w="is"/> basically a <unk w="series"/> of solutions which <unk w="can"/> then be <unk w="included"/> <unk w="of"/> the financial contribution from the public authority <unk w="to"/> do just that - to fund research and <unk w="development"/> , perhaps through a first competing stage of ideas , and then take those <unk w="appropriate"/> solutions to a next stage towards the viability <unk w="of"/> a <unk w="culture"/> or service that can then <unk w="be"/> launched .
The benefits of having that backing , for a small enterprise in particular , and giving that commercial support will <unk w="be"/> really important to <unk w="big"/> business .
Indeed , where this has been already rolled out , we see the experience <unk w="of"/> businesses , even <unk w="if"/> they do <unk w="not"/> produce <unk w="a"/> winning solution , have had an <unk w="interest"/> of their <unk w="disagreement"/> and development funded that they can then go on <unk w="their"/> use to <unk w="all"/> other revenue-generating products .
This <unk w="frank"/> ties in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> second initiative from <unk w="the"/> Commission covered in my report , the ' lead market initiative ' , where we are looking for public authorities <unk w="to"/> lead <unk w="to"/> a number of key technology areas around <unk w="major"/> and climate change in <unk w="europe"/> .
<unk w="there"/> are signs of an <unk w="economic"/> policy emerging , <unk w="but"/> my report says that <unk w="it"/> <unk w="is"/> more <unk w="effective"/> , we need <unk w="the"/> best <unk w="practice"/> , and we <unk w="must"/> <unk w="the"/> dispersion and dissemination of this proposal .
I hope that the Commissioner , and indeed the College , will pick up on this and <unk w="that"/> this Parliament will show it is right <unk w="for"/> this solution .
In conclusion - <unk w="and"/> if you will allow <unk w="such"/> a short amount of extra time <unk w="."/> this is , in a sense a <unk w="point"/> of order - I <unk w="wish"/> to point out first of all to this empty House that I had two <unk w="questions"/> for my <unk w="colleague"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="report"/> from the Committee on Legal Affairs and Mrs <unk w="malmstrom"/> from <unk w="the"/> Committee on Industry .
They <unk w="are"/> of course not allowed to present those opinions here , which seems rather a shame since they made <unk w="the"/> contributions which I have added to my amendments .
I also want <unk w="to"/> <unk w="congratulate"/> my <unk w="colleague"/> , Mr Hasse <unk w="martin"/> , for working with me , and he has also contributed extensively .
Just to wind up , this is a solution <unk w="that"/> everyone will be winners : society , <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , <unk w="the"/> authorities , business , innovators and the European economy .
That is <unk w="why"/> <unk w="it"/> is so important <unk w="and"/> why , when we are looking to public authorities to continue investment in this <unk w="field"/> of economic crisis , this proposal is <unk w="more"/> <unk w="more"/> important than it was when I started this report a few <unk w="years"/> ago .
Member <unk w="states"/> <unk w="the"/> Commission . - <unk w="madam"/> <unk w="president"/> , I could <unk w="not"/> agree <unk w="with"/> , because <unk w="public"/> procurement <unk w="is"/> a twofold goal .
It improves the quality of public services , <unk w="and"/> most of all it <unk w="is"/> up <unk w="just"/> for industry to <unk w="protect"/> the <unk w="planet"/> in international markets .
So it is money very well spent , above all in a time <unk w="to"/> crisis when we need to help our industry to <unk w="put"/> into practice the results <unk w="of"/> research and to make <unk w="the"/> best <unk w="use"/> of <unk w="concrete"/> solutions <unk w="to"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
I am very glad that the rapporteur , Mr Harbour , together <unk w="with"/> <unk w="the"/> Commission , <unk w="has"/> supported what has been in the pipeline for <unk w="such"/> a <unk w="long"/> time .
But there <unk w="is"/> a difference between being <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w=","/> and being put into practice .
I really hope that <unk w="parliament"/> 's <unk w="future"/> will become a <unk w="reality"/> and an important element to add to our research <unk w="and"/> innovation policy .
Indeed , triggering a strong public-sector demand <unk w="for"/> the development of new innovative products and services <unk w=","/> Europe can make a difference , especially for our SMEs , and that is why I welcome <unk w="this"/> initiative .
What are <unk w="we"/> <unk w="the"/> concrete steps we will have <unk w="to"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> ?
As an immediate response to the concrete recommendations in <unk w="this"/> <unk w="report"/> , I can confirm that the Commission will support actions to promote the <unk w="exchange"/> of experience and awareness-raising , and will explore the <unk w="need"/> to <unk w="create"/> incentives <unk w="and"/> procurers across a <unk w="number"/> of Member States in order to implement pre-commercial procurement projects jointly .
<unk w="the"/> Commission <unk w="has"/> already opened calls for proposals - in the INTERREG , CIP and FP7 programmes - <unk w="we"/> support the establishment of networks of <unk w="local"/> authorities on pre-commercial <unk w="ground"/> .
In the medium to long term , I <unk w="hope"/> <unk w="that"/> governments in <unk w="brussels"/> should incorporate pre-commercial procurement <unk w="and"/> their strategic planning for <unk w="their"/> investments .
I think that the recovery packages would <unk w="be"/> a good place to start .
On <unk w="the"/> Commission <unk w="proposal"/> , I will emphasise <unk w="this"/> in a communication planned for <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> March this year , in which I will propose a strengthened strategy for ICT Research , Development and Innovation for Europe , so <unk w="that"/> <unk w="this"/> will be included in this report .
<unk w="as"/> you know , some Member States have already started experimenting with pre-commercial procurement pilot projects .
In the coming months we hope to see more of those , and I invite the members of the committee , and also the Members of this House , to <unk w="go"/> back to <unk w="third"/> countries and to talk <unk w="to"/> the ministers and the municipalities <unk w="of"/> pre-commercial <unk w="parliament"/> .
We can <unk w="only"/> make a difference if we work together .
Thank you <unk w="very"/> much for <unk w="having"/> a helping hand here .
Driving innovation and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> knowledge economy <unk w="is"/> key in ensuring <unk w="the"/> high quality public <unk w="service"/> .
The US public <unk w="administration"/> spends USD 50 billion per year on research and development procurement , which is twenty times higher than <unk w="in"/> the EU , and therefore Member <unk w="states"/> must honour <unk w="the"/> <unk w="efforts"/> to invest 3 % of GDP <unk w="to"/> research and development .
There are today numerous <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> programmes , the results of which have not yet been exploited by public authorities through public <unk w="interest"/> .
The current practice <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="eu"/> is <unk w="not"/> <unk w="the"/> exclusive development , which means that each company retains the ownership rights in respect of the new ideas it generates .
<unk w="despite"/> the fact that pre-commercial <unk w="directive"/> provides <unk w="for"/> simplification , the whole process is <unk w="very"/> exacting .
Public authorities may be <unk w="involved"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> participation of universities and research <unk w="programmes"/> .
Member States should <unk w="be"/> <unk w="governed"/> by the experiences of <unk w="the"/> European <unk w="union"/> agencies taking <unk w="place"/> in research and development .
I <unk w="believe"/> that , <unk w="on"/> the basis of <unk w="the"/> suggestions in Malcolm Harbour 's <unk w="report"/> , the Commission <unk w="will"/> produce a comprehensive , easy-to-understand handbook <unk w="to"/> provide in particular small and medium-sized <unk w="businesses"/> and appropriate authorities in the <unk w="field"/> of public procurement <unk w="and"/> assistance in implementation .
It is <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> through close cooperation between EU Member States <unk w="and"/> the <unk w="eu"/> <unk w="of"/> <unk w="public"/> procurement <unk w=","/> we shall be able to drive innovation and ensure sustainable high quality <unk w="of"/> services .

Combating the <unk w="economic"/> exploitation of <unk w="children"/> and child pornography ( debate )
The next item is report by Mrs <unk w="karamanou"/> , <unk w="on"/> behalf of the Committee on <unk w="civil"/> Liberties , Justice and Home <unk w="affairs"/> , on a proposal for a European Parliament <unk w="and"/> to the Council on combating the <unk w="sexual"/> exploitation of children and child pornography .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to begin by thanking my fellow Members <unk w="for"/> their excellent <unk w="report"/> , which has enabled us , in my opinion , to <unk w="have"/> a highly satisfactory text .
I am also grateful to all the NGOs and institutions that <unk w="have"/> followed our <unk w="own"/> <unk w="work"/> .
We set out with two key objectives , the first being to check carefully <unk w="on"/> what extent the 2003 framework decision is being implemented within the 27 <unk w="member"/> States , <unk w="and"/> the second <unk w="decision"/> to propose <unk w=","/> as necessary .
The fact is that the framework <unk w="directive"/> must be <unk w="made"/> to increase the level of protection for <unk w="women"/> , in light of <unk w="the"/> rise in new and disturbing cases of exploitation linked <unk w="to"/> new technologies .
The first of the priorities <unk w="set"/> is <unk w="the"/> <unk w="fight"/> against sex tourism , which worryingly is on the <unk w="subject"/> , <unk w="but"/> because of lower travel costs .
<unk w="from"/> this point of <unk w="view"/> , extra-territorial cooperation <unk w="must"/> be improved and <unk w="member"/> States <unk w="to"/> be asked to rule out the <unk w="notion"/> of <unk w="international"/> criminality for crimes concerning the exploitation and abuse of children .
Secondly , grooming , <unk w="there"/> is <unk w="always"/> <unk w=","/> online psychological manipulation with the aim of soliciting children for <unk w="commercial"/> purposes , should be <unk w="given"/> a criminal <unk w="offence"/> in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="member"/> States .
Thirdly , Member States <unk w="must"/> be <unk w="able"/> to exchange the <unk w="views"/> contained <unk w="in"/> criminal records <unk w="or"/> to <unk w="prevent"/> abuse convictions .
<unk w="the"/> aim of this is to <unk w="help"/> eliminate the possibility <unk w="of"/> perpetrators <unk w="of"/> sexual abuse could hold jobs that <unk w="make"/> contact with children .
<unk w="if"/> the proposals to be implemented as soon as possible is the launch of the missing child rapid alert system .
This system <unk w="has"/> already been trialled <unk w="in"/> <unk w="which"/> , although by only a small <unk w="number"/> of Member States <unk w=","/> so only <unk w="at"/> trial level , but has given excellent results .
<unk w="we"/> therefore need to roll it out across <unk w="the"/> 27 Member States .
It is worth <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> , <unk w="in"/> fact , that every year <unk w="in"/> Europe , thousands <unk w="of"/> thousands of children disappear without trace .
I would <unk w="like"/> to highlight one further <unk w="question"/> : <unk w="in"/> general , national legislative authorities must commit to improving protection for child victims <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w=","/> before and after <unk w="the"/> court <unk w=","/> in which children are involved .
<unk w="we"/> <unk w="will"/> prevent children from <unk w="the"/> victims <unk w="of"/> <unk w="terrorism"/> , firstly victims of <unk w="terrorism"/> , and then victims of media or legal <unk w="protection"/> .
Finally , we have highlighted the need for <unk w="research"/> in criminalising forced marriages , <unk w="the"/> majority of which concern children .
To conclude , Mr <unk w="president"/> , I believe it is important to ask all Member States to <unk w="decide"/> as soon as possible <unk w="the"/> most recent Council of Europe Convention on <unk w="the"/> Protection of <unk w="women"/> against <unk w="child"/> Exploitation and <unk w="child"/> Abuse .
This is <unk w="a"/> convention of October 2007 , the benchmark representing the most innovative and up-to-date act on child <unk w="use"/> .
<unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of <unk w="the"/> Commission . - ( <unk w="es"/> ) <unk w="mr"/> President , ladies and gentlemen , I <unk w="would"/> first like to thank <unk w="commissioner"/> Angelilli warmly for her <unk w="excellent"/> report .
I would also like to thank her for the <unk w="work"/> she <unk w="has"/> worked with <unk w="the"/> Commission on a <unk w="very"/> delicate , sensitive subject <unk w="in"/> which we <unk w="deem"/> so strongly .
Children are vulnerable and they are <unk w="subjected"/> to protection in order to ensure their harmonious <unk w="development"/> .
Sexual abuse and the <unk w="various"/> types <unk w="of"/> exploitation , especially child <unk w="pornography"/> , are despicable crimes with <unk w="terrorism"/> , <unk w="its"/> effects on its young victims .
<unk w="medical"/> sources say that between 10 and 20 % of children in Europe have suffered one form of sexual attack or another during their childhood .
The European Union has <unk w="set"/> itself with legislation on the issue .
The framework decision of 2004 establishes a minimum level of harmonisation for national <unk w="sovereignty"/> in respect of <unk w="law"/> and jurisdiction .
Despite the incompleteness of the information , the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="union"/> , in a 2007 report , that <unk w="the"/> framework decision had , <unk w="in"/> general , been <unk w="fully"/> implemented .
<unk w="the"/> development <unk w="of"/> the Internet is contributing to the proliferation of new threats for <unk w="young"/> children .
Child pornography <unk w="on"/> <unk w="out"/> of these and <unk w="does"/> exist , such as child solicitation , to <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> Angelilli <unk w=","/> alluded .
Sex tourism to <unk w="third"/> countries for the <unk w="benefit"/> of abusing <unk w="sport"/> <unk w="become"/> a reality , whilst <unk w="it"/> is not unknown for <unk w="or"/> <unk w="to"/> be committed by <unk w="immigrants"/> who have been convicted <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="terrorism"/> .
At the end <unk w="of"/> 2007 , <unk w="we"/> negotiated a convention with the Council of Europe to introduce a <unk w="new"/> high standard <unk w="of"/> <unk w="safety"/> .
<unk w="in"/> its first <unk w="reading"/> , 20 <unk w="of"/> the 27 Member States have signed this convention .
That <unk w="said"/> , Parliament is still <unk w="completely"/> satisfied , and <unk w="mr"/> Angelilli 's report <unk w="is"/> evidence <unk w="of"/> <unk w="this"/> .
Parliament demands better <unk w="action"/> and especially a <unk w="considerable"/> improvement in the European framework , <unk w="is"/> a <unk w="series"/> of features to reinforce the <unk w="fight"/> against these <unk w="crimes"/> .
I have announced a review <unk w="of"/> <unk w="the"/> existing European legislation on the issue and will submit a proposal for adoption by the <unk w="council"/> in March .
I want to put <unk w="an"/> ambitious text on <unk w="the"/> table that will deal not only <unk w="law"/> enforcement but also protection <unk w="for"/> victims and prevention .
<unk w="the"/> suggestions contained in the report will help us to implement this proposal .
Most of the <unk w="commission"/> 's contents should find a <unk w="solution"/> in the new framework decision , but if this <unk w="is"/> <unk w="is"/> to be possible , for <unk w="economic"/> or legal reasons , we will try to identify the most suitable tools to implement any proposals left out of this framework decision .
<unk w="you"/> will see if there is a possibility for political <unk w="dialogue"/> , particularly <unk w="in"/> <unk w="political"/> dialogue with third countries , or even to provide ourselves <unk w="with"/> financial instruments , as is <unk w="the"/> <unk w="possible"/> for <unk w="the"/> existing programmes .
Mr President , ladies and <unk w="gentlemen"/> , I am <unk w="glad"/> to <unk w="express"/> Parliament 's desire to move forward <unk w="with"/> <unk w="the"/> adoption <unk w="of"/> ' kidnap warning ' mechanisms in each Member <unk w="state"/> .
I have to say , <unk w="at"/> the last meeting of the interior and justice ministers , I <unk w="believe"/> with much determination <unk w="that"/> it was necessary to provide each <unk w="of"/> the Member States <unk w="with"/> a ' kidnap warning ' <unk w="system"/> .
<unk w="to"/> be fully effective , these <unk w="are"/> <unk w="are"/> , of <unk w="course"/> , have to be interconnected .
Once again , I would <unk w="like"/> to thank the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="commission"/> for its determined <unk w="work"/> .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women 's Rights and <unk w="social"/> Equality . - ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the new <unk w="communication"/> submitted by <unk w="the"/> Commission is urgently <unk w="required"/> .
The <unk w="chairman"/> of the Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality have specific questions and suggestions relating <unk w="to"/> the proposal .
It is essential that we go <unk w="within"/> the confines of the Daphne <unk w="programme"/> and <unk w="the"/> legislative <unk w="measures"/> in <unk w="the"/> <unk w="to"/> <unk w="of"/> child pornography .
Of course , this <unk w="is"/> also the responsibility of the users , <unk w="the"/> <unk w="member"/> states must take action .
For example , I <unk w="believe"/> that Europol is an <unk w="excellent"/> tool which , <unk w="together"/> with <unk w="an"/> effective network of <unk w="education"/> and a special unit whose members have had training on very specific issues , can be used to combat child pornography <unk w="and"/> prostitution .
We must also resolve the question of extraterritoriality by taking a joint European <unk w="action"/> .
We <unk w="need"/> more <unk w="useful"/> information in the form of <unk w="impact"/> studies on the social situation of the victims , because family members themselves are often responsible <unk w="for"/> abusing <unk w="them"/> and <unk w="let"/> them <unk w="from"/> <unk w="the"/> net .
It is <unk w="important"/> <unk w="for"/> us to make definite progress in this <unk w="area"/> .
I hope that the Commission is <unk w="going"/> to work <unk w="together"/> with the Committee on <unk w="women"/> <unk w="and"/> Rights and Gender Equality so that we can resolve these questions together .
on behalf <unk w="of"/> the <unk w="socialist"/> Group . - <unk w="mr"/> President , Europol 's organised crime report of 2006 stated that <unk w="the"/> advantages the Internet offers <unk w="in"/> terms of information <unk w="and"/> communication technology <unk w="is"/> extremely beneficial to <unk w="organised"/> crime .
There is <unk w="no"/> doubt , in <unk w="this"/> regard , that children are the most vulnerable group .
According <unk w="to"/> experts , around 90 % of 12 to 17 year-olds chat <unk w="on"/> the Internet .
Besides classmates and games , <unk w="'"/> use ' <unk w="s"/> user ' networks via chat rooms on <unk w="noise"/> , which are perfect contact <unk w="with"/> for <unk w="people"/> using false <unk w="arguments"/> to lure <unk w="the"/> <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> .
According to Internet Watch Foundation , which processed more than 30 000 <unk w="tonnes"/> in 2006 , 91 % of victims were under 12 years <unk w="now"/> .
Eighty per <unk w="year"/> were female , and child abuse domains totalled more than 3 <unk w="%"/> .
Moreover , 55 % of all child <unk w="soldiers"/> domains were hosted in the United States , <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> % in Russia and only 8 % in Europe .
It would be appropriate to put <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> disabling websites <unk w="and"/> children <unk w="on"/> the agenda of an <unk w="extraordinary"/> meeting .
We are witnessing a <unk w="new"/> international <unk w="series"/> of paedophiles <unk w="and"/> organised crimes connected <unk w="with"/> <unk w="the"/> <unk w="the"/> industry , as stated by Mrs Angelilli .
On the other side , <unk w="the"/> international cooperation <unk w="and"/> law enforcement authorities is limited .
It is almost incredible that eight ratifications are still missing in the case of the Optional Protocol <unk w="and"/> the Convention on <unk w="the"/> <unk w="rights"/> <unk w="of"/> the Child on the sale of children , child prostitution and child pornography ; four in the <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of the Palermo Protocol , which is <unk w="the"/> basic document for international <unk w="cooperation"/> in combating trafficking in human beings .
Slightly <unk w="more"/> than <unk w="one"/> of the Member States have still not <unk w="informed"/> the Council of <unk w="europe"/> Convention on Cybercrime .
Therefore , it is time <unk w="to"/> <unk w="make"/> a strong and clear message <unk w="to"/> the Council to revise <unk w="the"/> Council framework decision <unk w="and"/> the sexual exploitation of children and child <unk w="pornography"/> .
<unk w="mr"/> President , Commissioner Barrot , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by thanking Mrs Angelilli and everyone else for their very constructive cooperation .
<unk w="you"/> will surely remember how little <unk w="was"/> done at the beginning of this parliamentary <unk w="term"/> , <unk w="together"/> with the <unk w="european"/> <unk w="'s"/> strategy a year ago , the issue of <unk w="women"/> 's rights <unk w="in"/> a corner .
The decision <unk w="we"/> are to make here now concerns a child <unk w="but"/> right not <unk w="to"/> <unk w="and"/> sexually <unk w="infected"/> and <unk w="the"/> combating of child pornography .
I <unk w="am"/> , of <unk w="course"/> , <unk w="be"/> happy with the <unk w="commission"/> proposals that I managed to <unk w="be"/> accepted in the <unk w="committee"/> on <unk w="civil"/> Liberties , Justice and <unk w="home"/> Affairs and which I hope <unk w="will"/> be retained through the vote today .
The first proposal is that a child <unk w="must"/> be <unk w="taken"/> as such until <unk w="he"/> or she <unk w="is"/> <unk w="<NUMBER>"/> years old .
It <unk w="is"/> very important to be able <unk w="to"/> protect both young <unk w="farmers"/> and young <unk w="farmers"/> against sexual crimes , sexual abuse and sexual exploitation throughout the <unk w="world"/> .
The second proposal is to protect <unk w="people"/> against child sex tourism by all Member <unk w="states"/> criminalising sexual crimes <unk w="both"/> within and outside the <unk w="union"/> .
This <unk w="is"/> <unk w="all"/> those who commit <unk w="us"/> will never be able to be sex tourists and exploit the poorest and youngest children and young people <unk w="from"/> other countries because prosecution and punishment will await them when they <unk w="go"/> home , wherever that is <unk w="in"/> the EU .
The <unk w="first"/> <unk w="thing"/> is that we should now seriously tackle the Internet and , together with the largest credit companies , develop the <unk w="best"/> means , <unk w="with"/> the help of banks and <unk w="the"/> bureaux , Internet service providers and search engine providers and , of course , <unk w="the"/> travel industry , to close down payment systems <unk w=","/> <unk w="it"/> is made for <unk w="the"/> <unk w="prevention"/> and violations or the sexual exploitation <unk w="of"/> <unk w="children"/> and young <unk w="people"/> .
The same opinions are found everywhere where people <unk w="are"/> striving to <unk w="prevent"/> websites closed down and that <unk w="will"/> that children come before confidentiality <unk w="so"/> that the abuse <unk w="of"/> children and <unk w="the"/> <unk w="families"/> must <unk w="be"/> reported .
<unk w="this"/> <unk w="so"/> <unk w=","/> we can now sit back <unk w="and"/> <unk w="and"/> satisfied that , here in Parliament , we <unk w="have"/> taken the first step in respect of the rights of children , and <unk w="we"/> <unk w="cannot"/> get a new Treaty of Lisbon , children 's rights will also be a legal basis and a goal within <unk w="the"/> EU , and <unk w="we"/> <unk w="is"/> not before <unk w="it"/> .
Mr President , although the <unk w="current"/> <unk w="majority"/> of Member States make provision for <unk w="action"/> against the sexual exploitation of <unk w="children"/> and child pornography , <unk w="it"/> is still necessary to raise the level of protection of our children .
<unk w="it"/> <unk w="must"/> be emphasised that children who use new technologies , and especially the Internet , <unk w="and"/> at risk of contact with potential perpetrators of sexual offences .
In <unk w="accordance"/> with the danger which exists , Member States <unk w="will"/> be called upon to block access to Internet sites which contain <unk w="child"/> pornography .
There is <unk w="also"/> an <unk w="alternative"/> <unk w=","/> <unk w="to"/> carry out a Europe-wide campaign to make parents and teenagers <unk w="<UNKNOWN>"/> of <unk w="the"/> dangers <unk w="of"/> child pornography on <unk w="human"/> <unk w="ground"/> .
<unk w="if"/> the victims <unk w="of"/> this reprehensible business , and of their <unk w="property"/> , is also an <unk w="important"/> matter .
It is <unk w="an"/> obligation to give <unk w="the"/> best possible protection to <unk w="protect"/> children .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Mr President , I should like to thank Ms Angelilli for <unk w="this"/> report .
